SNT.87564.12	Details were given by the UK Transport Secretary, Ruth Kelly, in the House of Commons at 1730 UTC yesterday.

SNT.87564.16	Political figures in the UK continue to raise concerns about both the specific loss of this information, and the nature of governments ability to safely gather and maintain information.
SNT.87564.17	Susan Kramer, representing the Liberal Democrats stated "This constant attempt to gather data, to get more data, to know more about you, to link it more together, all of that it seems to me is what comes into question."

SNT.37376.19	Senator Joe Ludwig (Labor, Queensland) asked of the Minister for Justice and Customs Senator Chris Ellison in Question Time whether he stood by his claim that he made yesterday that the discovery of the Jian Seng demonstrated that the Australian Government had in place "aerial and maritime surveillance to intercept a vessel in these circumstances, and that was done", and asked why it took the Government two weeks to intercept the vessel after it entered Australian waters.
SNT.37376.20	Senator Ellison responded that at the vessel's first sighting on March 8 "it was not doing anything illegal", and criticised the Opposition's claim that the ship was drifting for seventeen days, saying that "it was not stated as having drifted for the whole of the 17 days".
SNT.37376.21	Ludwig went on to note that it was not Customs that spotted the ship but a "passing Australian barge", but Ellison had defended this, stating that Ludwig "thinks that commercial vessels have absolutely no role in looking out for Australia" and that Ellison will "rely on reports to our hotline and go out and inspect vessels".
SNT.37376.22	Later, Senator Kerry O'Brien (Labor, Tasmania) criticised the Government's implementation of coastal defense, and highlighted the dangers of ignoring the ship for seventeen days, saying that "it posed and possibly still poses unknown environmental and quarantine risks" and that the Jian Seng "has been refused admission to Weipa harbour...It could have been carrying literally anything."
SNT.37376.23	Senator David Johnston (Liberal, Western Australia) went on to debate that there are no shipping lanes in the area where the Jian Seng was found, and that devoting resources to a harmless ship would leave gaps in the coastal defenses elsewhere.

SNT.42638.89	After three days of talks, parties in Northern Ireland have come to a stalemate over the election of a chairperson for a committee to help setup a devolved government in Northern Ireland.
SNT.42638.90	It is now up to Northern Ireland Secretary of State Peter Hain to choose the next course of action.
SNT.42638.91	The committee, known as the Preparation for Government Committee, convened Monday to begin its first task: the election of a chairperson for the committee.
SNT.42638.92	Its main task however is to help set a roadmap for devolved government in Northern Ireland.
SNT.42638.93	The committee is made up of the two republican parties (Sinn Féin and SDLP), the two unionist parties (DUP and UUP) and the non-sectarianist Alliance Party.
SNT.42638.94	Sinn Féin's proposal is for the chairpersonship to revolve between them and the Democratic Unionist Party.
SNT.42638.95	The DUP proposed that Speaker of the Assembly Eileen Bell should be the chairperson.
SNT.42638.96	However, Bell stated that it would inappropriate for her to take the post and refused.
SNT.42638.97	They also suggested the DUP MP for South Antrim William McCrea and Alliance Party leader David Ford as possible candidates.
SNT.42638.98	Peter Hain called the refusal of parties to cooperate "frustrating."
SNT.42638.99	Sinn Féin, SDLP and the Alliance Party have all blamed the DUP for the failure.
SNT.42638.100	"Yet again the DUP, instead of helping to remove obstacles to devolution, have shown themselves to be nothing but obstructive and lacking in any spirit of co-operation," said Sean Farren of the SDLP.
SNT.42638.101	"If the DUP is not prepared to do the business or give any substantive indication in the course of June, then the British government would be as well stopping the salaries at the end of June," said Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness.
SNT.42638.102	"The practical reality is that the two biggest parties have not shown they are prepared to move forward at all."
SNT.42638.103	"The prevarication and petty wriggling by the DUP is preventing the potential for progress and holding us all up to public ridicule."
SNT.42638.104	On Monday, Ian Paisley asked for extension of the November 24 deadline fot two weeks.
SNT.42638.105	This is part of plan by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Toaiseach Bertie Ahern to set up a devolved government in Northern Ireland after its assembly was suspended in October 2002 over allegations of a IRA spy ring.
SNT.42638.106	If a plan for devolved government is not setup by November 24, direct rule from London will continue with greater input from the Republic of Ireland.
SNT.12015.107	PC manufacturer and Apple Computer competitor Dell, Inc. has stated that it is interested in shipping computers running Apple's Mac OS X. Michael Dell, founder and chairman of Dell Computers, made the comments while talking to David Kirkpatrick of Fortune magazine.

SNT.111716.112	Researchers say that two men claiming to be 'Bigfoot' hunters in Georgia in the United States and who claimed to have found the remains of the mythical creature earlier this month, are part of an elaborate hoax.
SNT.111716.113	Bigfoot hunters Matt Whitton and Rick Dyer stated on August 15, 2008 that they were hunting for the creature in the forests of northeastern Georgia when they came across the supposed corpse of one of the legendary cryptids.
SNT.111716.114	After finding the body, they claimed to have taken it home where they stored it in a freezer.
SNT.111716.115	The researchers then attempted to reclaim their money and went to the hotel Whitton and Dyer were staying in, only to find the rooms empty, and the two men nowhere to be found.
SNT.111716.116	Whitton and Dyer claimed they had photos, video and DNA evidence to support their claim, but only one photo portraying a blurred black figure in the distance in the forest was provided.
SNT.111716.117	The TimesOnline reports that the joke fell flat with Jeffrey Turner, who as Chief of Police in Clayton County, Georgia, put Mr Whitton on medical leave when he was shot in the wrist as he tried to foil a robbery earlier this summer.
SNT.111716.118	"As soon as we saw it was a hoax, I filed the paperwork to terminate his employment," said Chief Turner.
SNT.111716.119	"He's disgraced himself, he's an embarrassment to the Clayton County Police Department, his credibility and integrity as an officer is gone, and I have no use for him," he declared.

SNT.57401.149	Since then, there have been a number of schools burnt by suspected Thaksin sympathizers in various parts of the country.
SNT.57401.150	There is also the ongoing violence by Muslim separatists in the South Thailand insurgency, which has left 1,900 people dead since 2004.
SNT.57401.151	It was not immediately clear if the bombings had anything to do with the coup or the southern insurgency.
SNT.48987.152	In southern Afghanistan in the province of Ghazni, the 29-year old Dutch pilot Michael Donkervoort died when his F-16 fighter jet crashed.
SNT.48987.153	"The plane was flying at a great height when the accident occurred, which means it can be ruled out that the craft was shot down. " 
SNT.48987.154	 "We therefore assume it was an accident," said the Dutch Defense Ministry.
SNT.48987.155	There has been an investigation launched into the cause of the crash, which was found by a team of rescuers from the United States.
SNT.48987.156	The jet was flying with another F-16 when it crashed.
SNT.114026.157	The history of the riding can, in some measure, be read in the parties fielding candidates; in addition to the four national parties there are contestants from Libertarian, Communist, and Marxist-Leninist parties.
SNT.114026.158	The rich diversity of the riding has less than half of all households reporting English as the first language at home.
SNT.114026.159	Emerson cited this diversity after announcing he would not be running for a third term.
SNT.114026.160	"The reality is, Kingsway was an eminently winnable seat," said the Conservative Minister.
SNT.114026.161	"Not because I'm a hugely popular fellow in Kingsway, but because of vote splits and the way the first-past-the-post system works."
SNT.114026.162	Key in those vote splits are issues dividing the Liberal and NDP candidates.
SNT.114026.163	Naturalized Canadian Yuan points to her immigrant history, giving her an empathy with the immigrant and ethnic neighborhoods of the riding.
SNT.114026.164	"I came with limited means but through hard work, I got recognized and became a successful businesswoman."
SNT.114026.165	"I understand what immigrants have to go through to reach what they want."
SNT.114026.166	"I really respect and appreciate and like the multicultural fabric of our riding," says her NDP opponent Davies.
SNT.114026.167	"I'm the only candidate who lives here with roots here." The Teamster's lawyer is originally from Edmonton, but has been living in Vancouver environs since 1991.
SNT.114026.167-1	The Teamster's lawyer is originally from Edmonton, but has been living in Vancouver environs since 1991.
SNT.114026.168	The Conservative party candidate Salomon Rayek is not responding to press inquiries from several sources, and is cited as an example of a long-shot candidate - a candidate with little likelihood of being elected yet represents the party anyway.
SNT.114026.169	He's lived for the past three years in the riding, an engineer and small business owner who has a history of community involvement across south Vancouver.
SNT.114026.170	"I see the neighbourhoods in and around Kingsway as a great place to build on the natural vibrancy of the small business sector as a backbone for ethnically and economically diverse communities."
SNT.114026.171	The stage for this fight was set in 2006, when newly-elected Liberal Dave Emerson crossed the floor and directly into the Conservative Cabinet, first as Minister of International Trade then as Minister of Foreign Affairs following the resignation of Maxime Bernier.
SNT.114026.172	His defection stirred a firestorm of controversy locally in the staunchly left-leaning riding, which had elected a Progressive Conservative candidate exactly once since it's creation in 1953 - during the 1958 Diefenbaker landslide.
SNT.15789.173	The resolution, was submitted in the House of Representatives and referred to the U.S. House Committee on International Relations.
SNT.15789.174	The resolution comes in response to questions that have been raised about the handling of pre-war intelligence by the Bush administration, and the planning and execution of the Iraq war.
SNT.15789.175	"We would like to see a member of Congress look into whether or not the president committed impeachable offenses," said John Bonifaz, a constitutional lawyer.
SNT.15789.176	"We've been having that discussion with a number of offices."
SNT.15789.177	But Conyers is reluctant to take such a bold step just yet.
SNT.15789.178	"My inclination at this time is not to do something like that," Conyers said, although he noted that he wanted to press for an investigation in other ways, including sending committee investigators to London.
SNT.15789.179	Earlier this month, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said at a forum held by Conyers "If you read the record of the writing of the Constitution, 'high crimes and misdemeanors' had a very particular meaning at the time of the drafting of the Constitution."
SNT.15789.180	Rep. Barbara Lee's resolution of inquiry is a less-drastic parliamentary maneuver that would ask the administration to provide more information related to the claims in classified British memos that suggest that pre-war intelligence in Iraq was "fixed" in order to justify the invasion.
SNT.15789.181	The Resolution of Inquiry is a privileged resolution, which means that if it is not acted on in 14 legislative days after it is introduced, the member of Congress who introduced it is entitled to request that it be brought to the House floor for a vote.
SNT.15789.182	The committee may take the matter up right away, and could vote it down before the August recess.
SNT.15789.183	If they do not, they will be required to take it up by September 16th.
SNT.147349.184	The United States has said that "regional extremists" may be targeting Air Uganda airplane flights between Southern Sudan and Uganda.
SNT.147349.185	A warning posted yesterday on the Web site of the US Embassy in Khartoum says there is a "potential threat" on the flights between Juba, Sudan and Kampala, Uganda.
SNT.147349.186	The embassy did not name the potential attackers but said the threat is of "sufficient seriousness," and that air travelers should "maintain vigilance at all times."
SNT.147349.187	The US has increased its airport security following the failed attempted December 25 bombing of a Delta flight by a Nigerian man with explosives in his underpants.
SNT.147349.188	Sudan is one of fourteen countries where passengers headed for the US will undergo additional searches at airport security.
SNT.83870.189	Two scientists working at McGill University in Canada, reporting on their research and the research of other scientists, state in Scientific American that Vitamin D may have many uses in the human body besides building strong bones.
SNT.83870.190	According to the scientists, Luz E. Tavera-Mendoza and John H. White, Vitamin D intake may also be beneficial in the prevention of cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and fighting tuberculosis, influenza and inflammatory bowel disease.
SNT.83870.191	The researchers say that there is an emerging "widespread consensus" among experts that a large part of the population has levels of Vitamin D in their bodies that is well below optimal concentrations for health, particularly in temperate regions, due to decreased sunlight and or less time outdoors, and during or just after the winter months.
SNT.83870.192	One study indicated that as many as 92% of adolescent girls in Northern Europe may have deficient levels of Vitamin D and 37% have severely deficient levels.
SNT.83870.193	The problem is far worse among African-Americans than Americans with lighter skin.
SNT.83870.194	Almost half of African-American women may be seriously Vitamin D deficient, with presumably still another fraction deficient.
SNT.83870.195	Furthermore, the authors say researchers at Harvard University and elsewhere believe the FDA minimum recommended daily allowance of Vitamin D is far too low.
SNT.83870.196	The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) ranges from 200 to 600 International Units (IU).
SNT.83870.197	The first author takes 1000 IU during wintertime and the second author takes 5,000 IU in wintertime.
SNT.83870.198	They do caution, however, that there is a level at which Vitamin D becomes toxic.
SNT.83870.199	Similar research has also been recently performed by researchers at the Queensland University of Technology who found that many elderly were likely not getting sufficient Vitamin D due in part to insufficient exposure to the sun.
SNT.48012.200	The shooting death by Canadian troops of a 10 year-old boy in Afghanistan has raised fears of a backlash and retaliation.
SNT.48012.201	The boy was shot and a teenager injured at around 5pm local time yesterday when, while driving a motorcycle, they sped through a roadblock cordoning off the scene of a suicide bombing.
SNT.48012.202	A soldier fired a bullet which passed through the 17 year-old driver and killed the boy.
SNT.48012.203	"A motorcycle carrying two people broke through the Afghan National Police outer security cordon at high speed," said Colonel Fred Lewis, deputy commander of the Canadian contingent of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.
SNT.48012.204	"The driver failed to heed multiple warnings to stop as he headed towards the inner Canadian cordon. " 
SNT.48012.205	"A Canadian ISAF soldier then opened fire in a defensive application of our rules of engagement. " 
SNT.48012.206	"A single round struck both the driver and the passenger of the motorcycle."
SNT.48012.207	Lewis doubts soldiers had time to fire warning shots due to the speed of the oncoming motorcycle.
SNT.48012.208	He also said that while no explosives were found on the vehicle he had a "sneaking suspicion" that soldiers feared the motorcycle carried a second suicide bomber and acted defensively.
SNT.48012.209	He added that he was concerned that the Taliban would try to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and that he was concerned about a possible backlash by locals.
SNT.48012.210	"I would be concerned about it and I think we need to pass the right message to the Afghan people," he said.
SNT.48012.211	"The message is that we're here to help them and we certainly would never want to hurt them."
SNT.48012.212	Relatives of the boys were at the gates of the Canadian military base last night demanding answers.
SNT.48012.213	Corporal David Braun was killed in the suicide attack which occurred two hours before the shooting.
SNT.48012.214	Three other soldiers were wounded but are listed in good condition.
SNT.48012.215	An Afghan child also died in the blast which occurred when a suicide bomber rammed his car into a Canadian convoy on patrol in Kandahar.
SNT.48012.216	Corporal Braun is the 27th Canadian soldier to die since Canadian military operations in Afghanistan began in late 2001 as part of the American led "War on Terror".
SNT.217859.217	Researchers at Japan's Kanazawa University announced the identification of a hormone produced by the liver, apparently a previously unknown cause of insulin resistance.
SNT.217859.218	The discovery may offer new research targets in treating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
SNT.217859.219	Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition where the body's cells are unable to respond properly to insulin-based treatments.
SNT.217859.220	The pancreas continues insulin production but fails to prevent increases in glucose levels; in other words, the body becomes unable to respond to the insulin properly.
SNT.217859.221	The researchers found the liver expresses higher levels of the gene encoding "selenoprotein P" (SEPP1) in people with type 2 diabetes – those with more insulin resistance.
SNT.217859.222	This new connection between SEPP1 and adipokine is to be an area for further research.
SNT.217859.223	The discovery may help in understanding plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease.
SNT.217859.224	Researchers at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan concluded in an earlier study that insulin resistance and the development of plaques found in Alzheimer's sufferers were likely linked.
SNT.217859.225	The World Health Organisation estimates 37 million people worldwide live with dementia and/or Alzheimer's.
SNT.431239.226	Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson received the 2012 presidential nomination of the U.S. Libertarian Party at Saturday's Libertarian National Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada.
SNT.431239.227	Judge James P. Gray of California was selected as his running mate.
SNT.431239.228	Johnson's association with the Libertarian Party stretches back to 1993, when he was a dues-paying-member for about a year.
SNT.431239.229	In 2000, the party recruited him to run as their presidential nominee, but he rejected the offer, saying, "I'm a Republican, and I'm not going to run for President."
SNT.431239.230	As a Republican, Johnson was elected and re-elected as governor of New Mexico in 1994 and 1998.
SNT.431239.231	During his governorship, he vetoed over 750 bills, more than all other then-governors combined, and left the state with a $1 billion budget surplus.
SNT.431239.232	Since leaving office in 2003 due to term limits, he has advocated for marijuana legalization, climbed Mount Everest, and has entered into presidential politics.
SNT.431239.233	During the 2008 Republican primaries, Johnson endorsed the candidacy of Congressman Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party's 1988 presidential nominee.
SNT.431239.234	In 2012, he chose to mount his own presidential campaign, seeking the Republican Party nomination on a platform of non-interventionism in foreign affairs and extensive cuts to the federal budget.
SNT.431239.235	Though he participated in two early Republican debates, Johnson was barred from most due to low poll numbers.
SNT.431239.236	As a result, in December, he decided to end his Republican campaign and return to the Libertarian Party.
SNT.431239.237	After months of campaigning, Johnson edged activist R. Lee Wrights on the first ballot with 70 percent of the 595 convention delegates.
SNT.431239.238	In contrast, former Congressman Bob Barr took six ballots to secure the 2008 nomination.
SNT.431239.239	Upon his victory, Johnson proclaimed, "I am honored and I just want to pledge that no one will be disappointed."
SNT.431239.240	He suggested the party nominate James P. Gray as his running mate, and they complied, choosing Gray as the vice presidential nominee.
SNT.431239.241	Gray is a jurist, who has served as a trial judge for Orange County, California since 1983.
SNT.431239.242	He ran for Congress as a Republican in 1998, and was the Libertarian Party's 2004 nominee for U.S. Senate in California.
SNT.431239.243	In his writings and media appearances, Gray has advocated against the War on Drugs.
SNT.431239.244	In 2008, the Libertarian Party appeared on 45 state ballots with Barr winning 0.4 percent of the popular vote.
SNT.431239.245	A recent Public Policy Polling (PPP) survey shows Johnson with six percent national support in a matchup with President Barack Obama and the presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney.
SNT.431239.246	A PPP poll from December showed Johnson with 23 percent support in a three way race in New Mexico.
SNT.39955.247	The United Kingdom Home Secretary Charles Clarke has lost his position in a Cabinet reshuffle by Tony Blair, on the morning after the Labour Party suffered losses in local elections across England.
SNT.39955.248	The news follows two weeks of headlines caused by the release of over 1000 foreign prisoners mistakenly released from prison at the end of their sentence rather than being deported.
SNT.39955.249	Current Defence Secretary John Reid will replace Clarke as the new Home Secretary, and Jack Straw will become Commons leader.
SNT.206230.250	The inventor of The Club steering lock James E. Winner, Jr. has died in a head-on car accident in Clarion County, Pennsylvania aged 81 today.
SNT.206230.251	Authorities say the accident occurred when Winner drove his SUV into oncoming traffic.
SNT.206230.252	Winner created The Club steering lock in the early 80s after his car was stolen.
SNT.206230.253	He came up with the idea while fighting in the Korean War; he secured his vehicle with metal chains to stop anybody taking it.
SNT.206230.254	He sold the first Club in Pennsylvania and later founded Winner International and sold over ten million units.
SNT.206230.255	Winner also owned hotels, a steel company, and other companies.
SNT.206230.256	A spokesman for Winner International said in a statement, "[this is] a very difficult time for all of us and the family would request that you honor their privacy."
SNT.263509.257	On Friday evening, an explosion in Chengdu, China caused partial shutdown of a facility operated by Foxconn, one of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers and a major supplier to companies like Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Sony, Apple, Motorola and Nokia.
SNT.263509.258	Initial investigations now suggest the explosion was caused by poor ventilation, which lead to high concentrations of combustible dust.
SNT.263509.259	The blast happened at 7:18PM, around the time workers change shifts.
SNT.263509.260	At least three people were killed, at least fifteen injured.
SNT.263509.261	Foxconn halted production to investigate, saying "All operations at the affected workshop remain suspended and production at all other workshops that carry out similar processing functions have also been halted pending the results of the investigation. "
SNT.263509.262	"All other production operations in our facilities in China continue operating normally."
SNT.263509.263	On Monday, city officials gave the cause as combustible dust in the air at a polishing workshop.
SNT.263509.264	Hong Kong-based labor rights group Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior said they reported aluminium dust problems in March when they reviewed working conditions at Foxconn.
SNT.263509.265	After the explosion, they commented that workers were complaining "the ventilation of the department is poor. "
SNT.263509.266	"In the process, there is lots of aluminum (aluminium) dust floating in the air. "
SNT.263509.267	"Workers always breathe in aluminum dust even though they put on masks. "
SNT.263509.268	"When workers take off their cotton gloves, their hands are covered with aluminum dust."
SNT.263509.269	Foxconn responded by saying the group was trying to "capitalize on the tragic accident" and misrepresented "Foxconn's commitment to the health and safety of our employees."
SNT.263509.270	Research group IHS iSuppli said the explosion may cause loss of production of 500,000 iPads during this quarter of the year.
SNT.263509.271	They said there is a larger facility in Shenzhen , but it cannot cope with re-compensating the possible loss.
SNT.744655.272	Friday, an undersea earthquake off the far east coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula was felt in the capital city of Moscow, 10,000 kilometers away.
SNT.744655.273	The earthquake occurred 600km below sea level in the Okhotsk Sea and recorded an 8.2 magnitude on the Richter Scale, with the Moscow shock measured as 1.0 on the scale.
SNT.744655.274	Citizens in Moscow said that the tremors were not "really strong" but they were enough to shake things hanging on walls.
SNT.744655.275	The last time such a shock was felt in Moscow was in 1984.
SNT.744655.276	This is a so-called deep-focus earthquake, that's why it was felt at such a large territory.
SNT.744655.277	If an earthquake happens at such a low depth, the waves move along low layers, practically the mantle, but weaken significantly before reaching the earth surface.
SNT.744655.278	This is why there usually is no injuries or casualties in such cases.
SNT.744655.279	Sahkalin Island was under a tsunami warning on Friday, however, it was lifted soon after.
SNT.744655.280	The island may have to prepare for a tsunami situation again, with another under sea earthquake predicted in the next week with a magnitude of over 7.0.
SNT.73662.281	Authorities from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation are currently investigating death threats targeted towards the New York investment firm Goldman Sachs.
SNT.73662.282	Threatening letters were sent to 20 U.S. newspapers, stating: "Goldman Sachs."
SNT.73662.283	The letter was described as being neatly written in red ink on blue-lined loose-leaf paper, and was signed "A.Q.U.S.A".
SNT.73662.284	The letters were believed to have been mailed from Queens, New York.
SNT.73662.285	The bank is working closely with law enforcement authorities, however, it was told by Goldman Sachs that the threat is not likely to be credible.
SNT.73662.286	A spokesperson for the bank says they take any threat very seriously.
SNT.73662.287	"We have a broad range of security measures in place to counter all likely threats and we're monitoring the situation closely."
SNT.73662.288	Goldman Sachs is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other major financial centers.
SNT.73662.289	More than 3,000 of its employees work in Jersey City, New Jersey, in the state's tallest building.
SNT.154734.290	Three people were killed and another was injured during a campus shooting at University of Alabama's Shelby Center for Science and Technology in Huntsville, Alabama.
SNT.154734.291	Several other possible victims were soon rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital.
SNT.154734.292	The surrounding area has since been cordoned off, and the entire university is currently under lockdown.
SNT.154734.293	"We have three confirmed people who are dead, one injured.
SNT.154734.294	"The shooter is in custody," university spokesperson, Ray Garner, told local media on the scene.
SNT.154734.295	Mr. Garner also said the shooter was a female, but he could not identify her or any of the victims.
SNT.60981.296	Pioneer Malaysian bloggers Ahiruddin Attan and Jeff Ooi have been sued for defamation by a leading Malaysian newspaper, The New Straits Times.
SNT.60981.297	They are alleged to have defamed top executives of the English daily.
SNT.60981.298	The case marks the first time bloggers have been sued for libel in the country.
SNT.60981.299	The oldest newspaper group in Malaysia is owned by the Media Prima group, which is in turn owned by the United Malays National Organization, the leading party in the government.
SNT.60981.300	Malaysia has strict media laws but they function less effectively on newer forms of electronic media.
SNT.60981.301	Leading members of the ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional (the National Front) have suggested making amendments to its media laws, such as to punish bloggers who publish materials that are deemed controversial and "anti-government".
SNT.181212.302	Falkirk were today relegated from the Scottish Premier League (SPL), after they failed to beat Kilmarnock away from home.
SNT.181212.303	The teams fought out a 0–0 draw at Rugby Park, a game which did not see many shots on goal with only nine in the whole game.
SNT.181212.304	It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005.
SNT.181212.305	Kilmarnock had previously been two points clear of twelfth position, occupied instead by Falkirk.
SNT.181212.306	The team in last place would be relegated, and, only needing a draw, Kilmarnock played a slow and defensive game.
SNT.181212.307	It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005.
SNT.181212.308	With only two shots on target the entire game, much of the credit for the draw went to each team's defensive line, putting in several last-ditch tackles to stifle attacks.
SNT.181212.309	While Falkirk had the upper hand in the first half possession-wise, the contest was more even in the second.
SNT.181212.310	On 77 minutes, the Falkirk side had the ball in the net, but the goal was disallowed for a clear foul on the Kilmarnock goalkeeper.
SNT.181212.311	Shortly after, Kilmarnock clipped the crossbar with a Craig Bryson effort.
SNT.181212.312	Falkirk had a glorious opportunity to win the game on 86 minutes, when the ball landed for Ryan Flynn with the goal empty, but the young midfielder put it over from ten yards.
SNT.181212.313	Kilmarnock manager Jimmy Calderwood, speaking after the game, spoke of his experiences: "It was a long, long day."
SNT.181212.314	"I wouldn't advise it for anybody to be honest, you know. "
SNT.181212.315	"We had a chance on the counter attack, we didn't take it, and then I think it was the 92nd or 93rd minute young Flynn missed a dottie of a chance."
SNT.181212.316	When asked about his future at the club, Calderwood replied: "I'll see what the idea is."
SNT.181212.317	" I wouldn't want to stay with too many games like this."
SNT.181212.318	The manager of Falkirk, Steven Pressley, also told Radio Scotland his views on the game: "It was a very emotional day, you know, we're bitterly disappointed, but once again I couldn't ask any more from this group of players. "
SNT.181212.319	"The things we talk about, the desire, the effort, the application, they were in abundance today."
SNT.181212.320	This was Pressley's first season as a manager, and he was questioned on his experience in the role: "I love it. "
SNT.181212.321	"It's been an emotional day today, but in terms of my three months in charge, it's been a terrific experience. "
SNT.181212.322	"I very much enjoy it here and hopefully we can certainly build for next season."
SNT.129235.323	14 people have died after heavy rain and flash flooding hit a gorge near the south western city of Chongqing, China.
SNT.129235.324	It is reported that a group of hikers entered a forbidden area of the Tanzhangxia Gorge along with a guide.
SNT.129235.325	16 members of the group of 35 were rescued but 14 died and 5 are still missing.
SNT.129235.326	The flooding was caused by a heavy rainstorm on Saturday which caused a wall of water to trigger down the gorge.
SNT.129235.327	Around 400 rescue workers are helping the rescue effort and looking for any possible survivors.
SNT.129235.328	Several homes and streets were flooded during the rainstorm despite the effort of the villagers who built temporary flood guards.
SNT.98301.329	"Though we are sad for his loss, he left a legacy that will inflame the enemy nation and religion."
SNT.98301.330	It is speculated that he was hit by a United States missile, which is now identified as being fired from a Predator drone, in the North Waziristan of Pakistan, and a dozen more militants were also reported dead.
SNT.98301.331	"The missile appeared to have been fired by a drone," said a Pakistani intelligence official.
SNT.98301.332	"They do have an ability to regenerate and replace these guys," said a Western intelligence official.
SNT.98301.333	Al-Libi is said to have been the third highest ranking member of al-Qaeda.
SNT.98301.334	The Government of Pakistan said they did not know about his death.

SNT.187985.336	On Saturday, May 29, Bingu wa Mutharika, President of the African country of Malawi, granted pardons to a gay couple who had been sentenced to 14 years in jail for sodomy and indecency charges.
SNT.187985.337	Mutharika, who has in the past dismissed homosexuality as alien, stated that he was releasing the couple on humanitarian grounds.
SNT.187985.338	On Thursday, the President of South Africa condemned the decision of the Malawi courts in a rare dissenting statement stating, "We have condemned the action taken to arrest people in terms of our constitution," in response to questions about the Malawi arrests.
SNT.187985.339	In December, Steven Monjeza, 26, and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, 20, were arrested following a personal engagement ceremony.
SNT.187985.340	The men were charged with gross indecency and unnatural acts, based on laws imposed during the British colonial period in Malawi.
SNT.76292.341	The largest extrasolar planet or exoplanet has been discovered orbiting the star GSC 02620-00648, around 1,435 light years away.
SNT.76292.342	The planet, named TrES-4, after the Transatlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES) is 1.7 times the size of the planet Jupiter.
SNT.76292.343	TrES-4 also has a lower mass than Jupiter and an extremely low density of 0.2 grams per cubic centimetre, which is less than a wine cork.
SNT.76292.344	TrES-4 orbits its star at a distance of only 7 million km (4.5 million miles), meaning that the temperature of the planet is estimated at 1,327°C (approximately 1,600K or 2,300°F).
SNT.76292.345	Mandushev went on to say, "Because of the planet's relatively weak pull on its upper atmosphere, some of the atmosphere probably escapes in a comet-like tail."
SNT.76292.346	Due to the planet's size, current theories about superheated giant planets find it hard to explain why it is so large.
SNT.76292.347	Francis O'Donovan, a graduate student in astronomy at the California Institute of Technology which operates one of the TrES telescopes said, "We continue to be surprised by how relatively large these giant planets can be.
SNT.76292.348	"But if we can explain the sizes of these bloated planets in their harsh environments, it may help us better understand our own Solar System planets and their formation."
SNT.34522.349	Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who jointly wrote together with a third author, a 1982 Non-Fiction book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail have taken The Da Vinci Code publisher Random House, to court claiming that The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail storyline has been stolen by Dan Brown.
SNT.34522.350	The third author of Holy Blood and the Holy Grail Henry Lincoln, is not involved in the case.
SNT.34522.351	Random House is the of publisher of both The Da Vinci Code and The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail.
SNT.34522.352	The central theme of the two books is that the bloodline from a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene survives today.
SNT.34522.353	Random House has denied the claim and, Random House chief executive Gail Rebuck says in a statement that she believed the lawsuit was without merit.
SNT.34522.354	"As publisher of both The Da Vinci Code and The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail, we are genuinely saddened that two of the three authors of HBHG have chosen to bring this litigation against us...Random House takes no pleasure in defending a legal action that it believes is without merit and we are confident that we will prevail."
SNT.34522.355	If this case is successful it could threaten the film; starring Tom Hanks and Sir Ian McKellen from opening.
SNT.34522.356	The Da Vinci Code is a fiction book and has over 36 million copies in print worldwide.

SNT.84134.368	He then left the stage, soon followed by his band.
SNT.84134.369	The venue, Metro Radio Arena, have announced that the singer had a sore throat.
SNT.84134.370	However, they also say that fans are unlikely to be refunded the cost of their tickets, priced at between £37.50 and £45, because he had performed for over an hour.
SNT.1871.371	Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes, along with his entire cabinet, resigned Saturday after President Jorge Sampaio dissolved the Western European nation's parliament.
SNT.1871.372	After a slew of crises during Santana Lopes's tenure, including poor credit ratings and accusations of media censorship, Sampaio dissolved the parliament on Friday in an attempt to restore credibility to the nation.

SNT.187937.374	Two sculptures have been confiscated and thirteen pro-democracy activists arrested in Hong Kong, in what critics have described as "politically motivated" censorship.
SNT.187937.375	The sculptures, a new replica of the "Goddess of Democracy" and a carving called the "Tiananmen Massacre Relief", had been placed in the piazza of Hong Kong's Times Square shopping mall in remembrance of the 21st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Incident.
SNT.187937.376	Although the Causeway Bay piazza is designated as a public space, its day-to-day operations are run by the shopping mall's management.
SNT.187937.377	They made a complaint that the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, or the "Alliance" for short, had failed to ask permission for their activities.
SNT.187937.378	When police and officials from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department attempted to remove the sculptures on the grounds for obstructing public access, they were prevented from doing so by activists for two hours.
SNT.187937.379	The police made 13 arrests, including that of a legislator for preventing the police from carrying out their duties.
SNT.187937.380	The statue was removed and is currently in the custody of the Customs and Excise department (C&ED).
SNT.187937.381	The 13 persons arrested were released on bail the same day.
SNT.187937.382	Alliance secretary Albert Ho claimed that as Times Square was a public area, the police had no right to stop them, that similar activities had been held before, and that he had "...never been treated so barbarically and so violently...".
SNT.187937.383	Alliance vice-chairman Lee Cheuk-yan said that C&ED's action was unusual, and that he has contacted the department to find out if the department was trying to censor materials related to the Tiananmen Square incident.
SNT.187937.384	As part of its Basic Law, Hong Kong continues to enjoy western-style liberties within the One country, two systems settlement within China.

SNT.716308.406	They won lineouts against the throw and counter rucked in a more efficient manner than Sunshine Coast.
SNT.716308.407	The final score in a lop side contest — Sunnybank Dragons 36 defeated Sunshine Coast Stingrays 6.
SNT.140971.408	Aid agencies and Indian government officials have warned that there may be food shortages in the country, following severe floods that affected southern states.
SNT.140971.409	They said that agricultural production is likely to drop dramatically due to flooding of farmland and crops.
SNT.140971.410	Officials have predicted that food production in Andra Pradesh, one of the southern states most affected by flooding, will go down by over 900,000 tonnes.
SNT.140971.411	The waters are said to have ruined large quantities of grain stocks as well.
SNT.140971.412	Jayakumar Christian, director of World Vision India, an aid agency working in the region, said that "floods and drought have set back India's fight against poverty by years."
SNT.140971.413	Heavy flooding last week, mainly in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring Karnataka, has killed about three hundred people and forced the evacuation of over a milion.
SNT.53040.414	The Group of Ministers (GoM) set up by the union government has given the thumbs-up for community radio stations to operate in India.
SNT.53040.415	The GoM has proposed that universities, registered trusts, civil society bodies and NGOs be allowed to run such stations.
SNT.53040.416	It has also proposed a single window clearance system to authorise such networks, with the assurance that the requisite clearances will be provided within three months.
SNT.53040.417	The GoM has also proposed that community radios be allowed up to 5 minutes of commercial advertising for every hour of broadcast.
SNT.53040.418	The possibility that the proposal may run into some trouble when put before the Cabinet does exist.
SNT.53040.419	Many private FM channels are supposedly displeased with the idea of having to face more competition.
SNT.53040.420	There are also concerns that community radios may be used by insurgent groups to compromise India's internal security.
SNT.53040.421	Those in favour of the proposal, however, say that this concept will start a revolution and empower rural India.
SNT.53040.422	Columnist, author and visiting professor at Centre for Policy Research, B G Verghese says, "This operates at the grassroot level and once people can have access to this kind of information, you can put across anything to them, whether it is education or health."
SNT.53040.423	"The twin towers have happened, there is no way you can stop it."
SNT.109195.424	According to reports, the government of People's Republic of China has stopped restricting access to the Chinese Wikipedia in some parts of the country starting on July 3.
SNT.109195.425	The report originated on the Wikimedia Foundation's mailing list quoting a website saying "Wikipedia Chinese version unblocked."
SNT.109195.426	Wikinews has confirmed that the reports are accurate through discussion with people attempting to access Wikipedia from China.
SNT.109195.427	Despite the report, there are still some issues with accessing the site according to readers of the site.
SNT.109195.428	Sources tell Wikinews that although the English version is unblocked, the Chinese version still remains blocked or hard to access in many parts of the country.
SNT.109195.429	This comes after the Chinese unblocking of the all other language variations of Wikipedia in April.
SNT.109195.430	Ian A. Holton, who is an administrator on the English Wikipedia, has confirmed that the Chinese Wikipedia is accessible in the Liaoning Province, although users in Shanghai, Shenzhen and some in Beijing are still unable to access the site.
SNT.109195.431	The restriction in Beijing does not appear to cover the entire area: sources have told Wikinews the site can be accessed in many parts of Beijing.
SNT.109195.432	There has been some doubt on whether Wikipedia will remain accessible after the Olympic games.
SNT.109195.433	Christiano Moreschi, another active contributor to the English Wikipedia, said that "I doubt this will last 5 minutes beyond the end of the closing ceremony of the Olympics."
SNT.109195.434	The International Olympic Committee warned China in April that it wanted the internet freely accessible for the entire duration of the Olympic Summer Games.
SNT.109195.435	Unrestricted access is guaranteed to the 30,000 reporters and media staff expected for the Olympics under Beijing's 'host city contract'.
SNT.66177.436	Former President of Russia Boris Yeltsin has died at age 76, according to a Kremlin spokesperson.
SNT.66177.437	"Today, at 15:45 (11:45 GMT) Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin died in the Central Clinical Hospital as a result of a deteriorating cardio-vascular problem," said the spokesperson.
SNT.66177.438	The Yeltsin era was a traumatic period in Russian history— marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems.
SNT.66177.439	Yeltsin maintained a low profile since his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances.
SNT.66177.440	However, on February 1, 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday.
SNT.66177.441	He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a "monopolistic" United States foreign policy, and to state that Vladimir Putin was the right choice for Russia.
SNT.88000.442	Sporting games are more popular with younger gamers and sporting people with a conjunction from two industries, between sporting and gaming.
SNT.88000.443	Although games from the NBA series are not the official games of the World Cyber Games, but with fashions of the NBA, and PC gaming population having a stable scale, the NBA game series attracted not only basketball and game fans but also sporting and gaming media world-wide, and its market was progressively expanded from America and Europe to Asia and other countries.
SNT.88000.444	With those issues in mind, Wikinews Reporter Rico Shen briefly interviewed Event Director of NBA Asia Corporation Ritchie Lai about the sports gaming market developments at the NBA 2K8 Asia Championship Taiwan Qualifier.
SNT.3967.445	The Colombian Caracol Radio reported on January 31, 2005 that the government of Colombia released a detailed document which describes how the FARC operates in Colombia and around the world.
SNT.84425.446	Kevin Rudd, Australia's Leader of the Opposition has promised a special home buyers' bank account with tax concessions if Labor is elected on November 24.
SNT.84425.447	Mr Rudd says AU$64,000 could be saved by a couple on the average wage over five years.
SNT.84425.448	The Housing Industry Association has welcomed the announcement but says it would be a start and would "avoid a stampede of first home buyers into the market."
SNT.84425.449	Prime Minister John Howard is bracing himself for a possible Wednesday interest rate rise which may decide the election.
SNT.84425.450	Howard has defended the rumours, saying that some rise would be 'unavoidable'.

SNT.109254.456	The extent of his injuries has not yet been released, but he is listed in stable condition.
SNT.363350.457	Three nations in three continents have seen attention focused on high suicide rates this week.
SNT.363350.458	A study found Scotland's suicide rate to be increasing away from neighbouring England, Russian press and politicians are examining the world's third-highest teen suicide rate, and new figures showed increasing Aboriginal children's suicides in Australia's Northern Territory.
SNT.363350.459	"Until the highest authorities see suicide as a problem, our joint efforts will be unlikely to yield any results," Boris Polozhy of Moscow's Serbsky psychiatric center said yesterday.
SNT.363350.460	Only fellow ex-USSR nations Belarus and Kazakhstan have higher teen suicide rates than Russia, which is at around 20 per 100,000 nationally.
SNT.363350.461	Tuva, Siberia, and nearby Buryatiya have rates of 120 and 77 per 100,000 respectively.
SNT.363350.462	Thursday saw national children's ombudsman Pavel Astakhov say 4,000 youths kill themselves each year.
SNT.363350.463	He said Russian schools, which are criticised for understaffing and perceived inattention to bullying, should teach psychology.
SNT.363350.464	"I have seen websites that offer a thousand ways of killing oneself," he claimed.
SNT.363350.465	Astakhov wanted schools to offer assistance via a social networking presence and tackle online bullying.
SNT.363350.466	The overall national suicide rate is decreasing — down from 42 per 100,000 in 1995 to 23.5 two years ago.
SNT.363350.467	The high rate amongst teens is attributed to both school problems and violence at home.
SNT.363350.468	Recent high-profile cases include yesterday's death of a twelve-year-old who hung himself at home in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, and two fourteen-year-olds who jumped hand-in-hand to their ends from a building in Lobnya, Moscow.
SNT.363350.469	Researchers from the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Manchester in England, have been looking at data from 1960 to 2008.
SNT.363350.470	Although Scotland had the lower rate until 1968, England and Wales has had the lower rate since.
SNT.363350.471	Both areas had increasing rates until the southern side started to fall in the '90s, and in recent years the gap has significantly increased.
SNT.363350.472	Data was sorted by age, gender, and method; marked increases were seen among Scotsmen aged from 25 to 54 with hanging increasing in popularity.
SNT.363350.473	"This study adds to our understanding about patterns of suicide in Great Britain by producing sound evidence on divergences in long-term trends in Scotland compared to England and Wales," said Professor Stephen Platt, a lead researcher from Edinburgh University's Centre for Population Health Sciences.
SNT.363350.474	"In a future companion paper we will suggest explanations for the persisting higher rate of suicide in Scotland."
SNT.363350.475	Fellow joint lead researcher Roger Webb of the Centre for Suicide Prevention of Manchester University said the high Scottish hanging rate was "of particular concern as hanging has high case-fatality and is difficult to prevent, except within institutional settings."
SNT.363350.476	He noted "a public information campaign about hanging" could be one way of reducing the rate.
SNT.363350.477	Paid for by the Scottish taxpayer, the results appeared in the British Journal of Psychiatry.
SNT.363350.478	In an incident with parallels to the recent Moscow deaths, in 2009 Scottish and British media publicised a high-profile case in which two teenagers leap together from the Erskine Bridge, a famed suicide spot over the where an estimated fifteen people kill themselves each year.
SNT.363350.479	This week also saw Howard Bath, Children's Commissioner for Australia's Northern Territory, suggest the area had the highest proportion of Aborignal girl suicides in the West.
SNT.363350.480	There has been a significant increase since an emergency intervention five years ago in response to a report titled Little Children are Sacred which documented widespread sexual abuse of Northern Territory children and failures by authorities to adequately respond.
SNT.363350.481	A national government-backed Northern Territory suicide inquiry is ongoing and due to report next month.
SNT.363350.482	The inquiry has heard clusters of deaths occurred around East and West Arnhem, Katherine, and the vicinity of Alice Springs.
SNT.363350.483	The Tiwi Islands had a very high rate from 2000 to 2005, but has now not had a suicide for a year.
SNT.363350.484	Female suicide rates have greatly increased to account for 40% of Northern Territory suicides amongst those aged less than eighteen.
SNT.363350.485	"We now have a situation in the territory where there are almost as many female as male suicides," said Bath.
SNT.363350.486	Lack of information is a problem; the all-party inquiry has heard evidence of much under-reporting and poor data collection.
SNT.363350.487	The Menzies School of Health's Gary Robinson called for a Queensland-style register of suicides.
SNT.363350.488	Robinson suggests cannabis-induced psychosis to be a contributing factor but laments "The big problem is nobody keeps any data."
SNT.363350.489	He also suggested bullying, as in Russia, is a problem while Bath notes violence against women may also take a role.
SNT.363350.490	"Aboriginal women are being hospitalised for assault at 80 times the rate of other women... "
SNT.363350.491	"Exposure to violence greatly increases the risk of a person taking their life."
SNT.363350.492	He also notes "I am concerned, as the commissioner, about children who are frequently exposed to violence in the home or in the immediate family."
SNT.363350.493	"The method chosen is usually hanging and it is a particularly lethal method, far more than an overdose," said Bath.
SNT.363350.494	New South Wales, with the nation's largest indigenous population, has a suicide rate of one per 100,000 but the Northern Territory rate is over 30 per 100,000.
SNT.193982.495	At around noon yesterday, a Heli-Express helicopter heading towards Macau crashed into the sea near Hong Kong's Shun Tak Centre with thirteen on board.
SNT.193982.496	Witnesses say the aircraft let out a loud 'bang', with no flames, then slowly descended to the sea.
SNT.193982.497	The New Zealand Herald quoted Hong Kong's Cable TV as saying that the rotorcraft performed an emergency landing on water after experiencing mechanical problems.
SNT.193982.498	Marine police, fire services, the Civil Aviation Department, and the Marine Department immediately sent rescue ships to the scene, which is between Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsular, inside Victoria Harbour.
SNT.193982.499	All passengers were safely rescued and sent to the Queen Mary Hospital for treatment.
SNT.4845.500	Judith Miller of The New York Times and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine can be jailed for refusing to reveal their sources to a U.S. federal grand jury, according to the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C.
SNT.4845.501	The reporters were among those approached with information about Valerie Plame as a CIA employee, and have refused to testify before an inquiry into the leak of national security information.
SNT.4845.502	Neither reporter actually wrote an article about Ms. Plame, whose identity was actually broken by Robert Novak in a July 14, 2003 column in the Chicago Sun-Times, but they have been the target of Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald of Illinois.
SNT.4845.503	The U.S. Intelligence Identities Act makes it illegal to reveal the identity of CIA officers.
SNT.4845.504	However, the three-judge panel's decision on Tuesday upheld a lower court's ruling last year that Ms. Miller and Mr. Cooper should answer confidential conversations with government sources.
SNT.4845.505	Citing secret evidence presented by Mr. Fitzgerald, the panel said this case differs from the classic uncovering of wrongdoing by reporters relying on unnamed sources.
SNT.182635.506	The Russian and Turkish governments today signed an agreement that would lead to Russia building a US$20 billion nuclear power plant in Turkey, the country's first.
SNT.182635.507	The plant will be built on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and construction will commence as soon as the deal is approved by both countries; the building process is expected to take around seven years.
SNT.182635.508	The reactor will also be owned by Russia, which will hold "no less than a controlling stake," according to Sergey Kiriyenko, who is the head of Rosatom, a Russian nuclear energy corporation.
SNT.182635.509	The reactor to be built is the second proposed power plant in the same location; a separate proposal for a four-reactor complex built by a Russian-led consortium was rejected by a Turkish court last year.
SNT.182635.510	Russia has attempted to build a nuclear power plant in Turkey, and the contract signed Wednesday "really looks rather impressive," according to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.
SNT.182635.511	The contract for the reactor was one of 20 signed by the two countries today, expected to result in around US$25 billion of Russian investment in Turkey.
SNT.182635.512	Other major contracts signed include projects to transport Russian oil and natural gas through Turkey to ports on the Mediterranean Sea.
SNT.182635.513	One such project is a major pipeline between the Turkish ports of Samsun on the Black Sea and Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea, built in conjunction with an oil refinery in Ceyhan.
SNT.182635.514	In a press conference, Russian President Medvedev said that the agreements signal "a new page in our cooperation...Our talks today showed that Turkey and Russia are strategic partners not only in words but in deeds."
SNT.182635.515	Turkish President Abdullah Gul said that the two countries "share a determination to increase the trade volume from a current US$38 billion to US$100 billion in five years."
SNT.204625.516	Riad al-Saray, an Iraqi television presenter, has been shot dead.
SNT.204625.517	He was killed at 06.00 am (03.00 GMT) on Tuesday in western Baghdad by unknown gunmen while he was heading to his work place in Karbala.
SNT.204625.518	Saray presented several political and religious programs on al-Iraqiya TV.
SNT.204625.519	Television journalist Ahmed al-Mullah said that traffic police saw Saray's car veer off the road and crash but did not hear any gunshots.
SNT.204625.520	He said that police have reported a silencer was used in what is thought to have been a planned attack.
SNT.204625.521	In addition to being a television presenter, Saray was also a trained lawyer, and served on the local council of a Shiite neighborhood.
SNT.204625.522	Human rights organization Reporters Without Borders released a statement stating, "Reporters Without Borders calls for a proper investigation capable of identifying and arresting both the perpetrators and instigators of this murder and bringing them to justice."
SNT.204625.523	"It would be deplorable it this killing were to go unpunished, which unfortunately has been the case in 99 per cent of the 230 murders of journalists and media workers since the US-led invasion in 2003."
SNT.204625.524	Saray's death brings the death toll of al-Iraqiya journalists killed since the removal of Saddam Hussien to 15.
SNT.204625.525	A total of 230 journalists and media assistants have been killed in Iraq since the 2003 U.S invasion.
SNT.217600.526	A song released yesterday in support of the BBC is making an impact on several UK music charts.
SNT.217600.527	Stand-up comic Mitch Benn wrote I'm Proud of the BBC in response to the criticism the licence fee-funded corporation has received from its commercial competitors and the right-wing press.
SNT.217600.528	The Conservative-led coalition government announced two weeks ago that the licence fee is to be frozen for six years, and that the BBC will take over responsibility from the Foreign Office for funding the World Service.
SNT.217600.529	The song, loosely inspired by Billy Joel, lists many of the BBC's achievements.
SNT.217600.530	Benn, a regular on BBC Radio 4's satirical programme The Now Show, decided to release I'm Proud of the BBC as a single after realising that it was provoking emotional responses from audiences during his nationwide tour.
SNT.217600.531	He told BBC Radio 5 Live that the song was receiving standing ovations, and people were wiping away tears.
SNT.217600.532	A video was filmed last month outside of Broadcasting House, White City and Television Centre with a cast of volunteers recruited from the social networking site Twitter.
SNT.217600.533	The song was officially released as a 'download-only' track on Monday.
SNT.217600.534	Yesterday's charts reveal that it has reached pole position on Amazon's rock chart, and is listed as the 14th most downloaded track overall.
SNT.217600.535	Fans have created two Facebook groups to promote the single in an attempt to get it to a good position in the UK Singles Chart, which would force the BBC's commercial rivals to play the track.
SNT.217600.536	Benn says that he has always been a supporter of the BBC, and yesterday compared it to the emergency services.
SNT.217600.537	"You also pay for the Fire Brigade, whether or not your house burns down. "
SNT.217600.538	He points out that he only receives a small percentage of his income from the corporation; last night he played with his band The Distractions at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.
SNT.84463.539	A magnitude 5.8 earthquake has struck in a place where earthquakes are rare, but sometimes large.
SNT.84463.540	According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), at 3:35 p.m (eastern time) the 5.8 quake struck in Antarctica, 105 kilometers (65 miles) south, southeast of Casey Station or 2565 kilometers (1590 miles) north of the South Pole.
SNT.84463.541	The quake was reported at a depth of 7.5 k.m. (4.7 miles), but the USGS says it was "poorly constrained."
SNT.84463.542	Had any civilization existed on the frozen ice cap, the USGS says that damage could be "light to moderate."
SNT.84463.543	Antarctica's biggest earthquake was a magnitude 8.1 which occurred on March 25, 1998 near the Balleny Islands of Antarctica.
SNT.289318.544	The body of a 28-year-old Pakistani journalist was found in his home in Lahore, Pakistan on Friday.
SNT.289318.545	The Pakistani police stated the journalist, Faisal Qureshi, who was working for a London-based online site, The London Post, was murdered on Friday in the early morning.
SNT.289318.546	Zahid Ahmed, a brother of the deceased, told police his brother had been "receiving threats" and "was a victim of targeted killing".
SNT.289318.547	Investigators have said the journalist was found with visible torture marks, as well as numerous stab wounds.
SNT.289318.548	Zahid told police he hurried to his brother's place late Thursday after his brother failed to answer his phone.
SNT.289318.549	Police have stated Faisal's laptop computer and phone were missing at the scene of the crime.

SNT.175345.568	A magnitude 5.2 earthquake has hit the Western Australian mining town of Kalgoorlie-Boulder.
SNT.175345.569	The earthquake, which struck at 08:17 am AWST (00:17 UTC), is the strongest to hit the region of Goldfields-Esperance in 50 years.
SNT.175345.570	Goldfields is considered one of the more geologically stable regions of Australia, in comparison to the southwest corner of the state, which is an active zone at the edge of the Yilgarn block.
SNT.175345.571	Kalgoorlie is located 600 kilometres (370 miles) east of the Western Australian capital Perth and is historically the largest gold producing centre of its type in Australia.

SNT.175345.573	Minor casualties and building damage have been reported, and miners and schoolchildren have been evacuated.
SNT.47967.574	Lech Walesa, the founder of the Solidarity movement has quit the organisation.
SNT.47967.575	The Solidarity trade union movement and political party was founded in 1980 to combat Poland's Communist government.
SNT.47967.576	"I have given up my membership last year because Solidarity and I have gone separate ways," said Walesa who served as Poland's first post-Communist president from 1990 to 1995.
SNT.47967.577	Walesa, 62, is boycotting Solidarity's 26th anniversary celebration this month as he does not want to appear with current President Lech Kaczynski and his twin brother, Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski with whose policies he disagrees.
SNT.47967.578	"His approach is to first destroy and then think about what to build," Walesa said of the president.
SNT.47967.579	Last August, he said of the union "This is no longer my union."
SNT.47967.580	It was revealed today that Walesa has not formally been a member of Solidarity since the beginning of this year.
SNT.47967.581	Walesa says he left Solidarity after the union ignored his criticism of its support of the Law and Justice Party led by the Kaczynskis.
SNT.47967.582	Solidarity was created as an independent trade union when such organizations were outlawed under the Communist state.
SNT.47967.583	Despite attempts to destroy the group through repressions, it came to embody a broad social anti-communist movement within Poland.
SNT.47967.584	It is credited as one of many dissident movements which in the 1980s pressured reforms which eventually led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and states in its sphere of influence.
SNT.47967.585	Solidarity eventually came to power in Poland with Walesa serving as President of Poland from 1990 to 1995.

SNT.8657.588	Estonia and Latvia, which were occupied by the Soviet Union until the early 1990s, joined the European Union in 2004.
SNT.8657.589	The two countries both border the Russian Federation, and have been trying to sign definitive border treaties for a long time since independence, but Moscow has repeatedly delayed on signing.
SNT.8657.590	Solana said he hoped the treaty would be signed at the EU-Russia Summit, because "Relations with the countries on the EU border [such as Russia] are very important."

SNT.27627.607	The members of the group Christians Against All Terrorism (CAAT) breached base security at dawn and two of them infiltrated two perimeter fences and scaled a building, before being arrested.
SNT.27627.608	Two of the protesters photographed themselves atop a building inside the spy base.

SNT.27627.610	The spokeswoman said the activists had allegedly cut holes in the external and internal fences at the defence facility.
SNT.27627.611	She said the combined charges carried a maximum penalty of seven years jail.
SNT.27627.612	The group claims it was the first break-in of its kind at Pine Gap.
SNT.27627.613	The group spoke yesterday of their efforts to conceal a digital camera memory stick in the clothing of key members to avoid the images being confiscated by police.
SNT.27627.614	Four of the protesters are from Queensland, one is from New South Wales, and the other is from Victoria.
SNT.27627.615	They say they wanted to conduct a citizens inspection of the controversial Pine Gap facility.
SNT.27627.616	"We could not allow the US and Australian governments to continue to conceal the role of Pine Gap in the ongoing war in Iraq," said Sean O'Reilly of the group.
SNT.27627.617	"It's time the Australian public knew the reality of what is happening on our land."
SNT.27627.618	Group member Jessica Morrison claims there is a lot of secrecy surrounding the facility.
SNT.27627.619	"So for me it was an attempt to come to a place that I think propagates death and start to proclaim truth," she said.
SNT.27627.620	Two of the group were released on bail facing charges, including: unlawfully entering a prohibited area destroying or damaging Commonwealth property; trespassing on Commonwealth land; damaging property under the NT law.
SNT.27627.621	A sixth member was arrested for aiding and abetting but was released without charge.
SNT.27627.622	Up to 30 police officers were stationed at a roadblock at the turn-off to Pine Gap at 6:00 a.m. local time and Gap staff were ordered to remain in their cars at the roadblock.
SNT.27627.623	CAAT member Brian Law, said four of the group split into two groups and entered the base in a co-ordinated movement.
SNT.27627.624	He said four members walked 10km through thick scrub and entered the base at 4:00 a.m. local time.
SNT.27627.625	Mr Law and the fourth member arrested, former human shield Donna Mulhearn, 37, (taken hostage by militants in Fallujah in Iraq last year) were released.
SNT.27627.626	Mr O'Reilly said the group conducted a citizens' inspection in protest at Pine Gap's involvement in the ongoing war in Iraq after the group had been refused official entry by Defence Minister Robert Hill.
SNT.27627.627	"We could not allow the US and Australian governments to continue to conceal the role of Pine Gap in the ongoing war in Iraq," Mr O'Reilly said.
SNT.27627.628	It was unclear last night whether the group would be charged under the Federal Government's tough new anti-terror laws.
SNT.27627.629	They were bailed to face the Alice Springs Magistrates Court next Wednesday.

SNT.214760.645	The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is facing several lawsuits, including one filed by residents of San Bruno, California, after a gas line exploded in their neighborhood on September 10, completely destroying over 50 structures, 37 of them homes.
SNT.214760.646	In their lawsuit, residents claim that PG&E knew the pipeline was "defective" and was a "ticking time bomb".
SNT.214760.647	They further allege that the company was aware that the pipeline could fail, but did not act.
SNT.214760.648	The lawsuit was filed by at least five families who resided in the Glenview neighborhood of San Bruno.
SNT.214760.649	The Danko firm who is representing the residents say they expect to file at least a dozen more lawsuits against the company alleging they were liable and responsible for the explosion and the damages that occurred as a result of it.
SNT.214760.650	"This was a foreseeable consequence of ignoring safety measures," one attorney representing the families said.
SNT.214760.651	It has also been reported that several other wrongful death lawsuits have been filed against PG&E.
SNT.214760.652	The explosion and subsequent fire was originally thought to have been a downed commercial aircraft.
SNT.214760.653	Live scanner communications at the time of the explosion had stated that fire departments from six different companies reported to the scene.
SNT.214760.654	Residents say that firefighters were not able to bring the blaze under control because the pipeline was active for at least 5 hours after the explosion.
SNT.214760.655	Residents filing the lawsuits are seeking damages and removal of the pipeline from the neighborhood.
SNT.214760.656	Jim Ruane, the mayor of San Bruno, backs residents in their request to PG&E to remove the pipeline from Glenview.
SNT.214760.657	"We want our neighborhood rebuilt, and we want our people back," he said.
SNT.214760.658	A PG&E spokesperson denied having officially received the lawsuits, but said: "We remain committed to our customers in San Bruno and will continue to be there to help rebuild the neighborhood."

SNT.204838.663	Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) throughout Europe and the United States are currently assembling a flotilla of up to 20 ships, which will set sail for the Gaza strip in the coming months in an attempt break the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory.
SNT.204838.664	Israeli-Swedish activist Dror Feiler said that the goal of the new flotilla is to double the size of the previous one, and for it to include more than a thousand people.
SNT.204838.665	"The Israeli Army can stop 12 to 50 ships if it wants," Feiler said.
SNT.204838.666	The Israel Defense Force is monitoring the actions of the planned flotilla, according to a report in the Jerusalem Post on Tuesday.
SNT.204838.667	The Israeli army is calling this new fleet of ships "the mother of all flotillas."
SNT.204838.668	A wide range of scenarios is being prepared for which include the possibility that due to the larger number of ships reported to be part of the flotilla, the Israeli navy may need to intercept it before the ships get close to Israel's shoreline.
SNT.204838.669	Officials say that Israel will warn ship operators that their crew may be detained and the vessel held until impound fees are paid, claiming the backing of international maritime treaties.
SNT.204838.670	"The legal approach proved effective as a deterrent, and we're prepared to see it through as a punishment.
SNT.204838.671	"If we are to pay a price for defending the blockade, the other side will pay a price for challenging it," a senior Israeli government official.
SNT.204838.672	The first flotilla to challenge the blockade was stopped by Israeli naval commandos in May this year.
SNT.204838.673	Nine activists were killed, and several dozen activists and seven Israeli commandos were wounded after Israeli troops clashed with activists.
SNT.117023.674	Islamic militants have vowed to fight pirates holding the Saudi Arabian oil tanker Sirius Star off the Somalian coast.
SNT.117023.675	The militants are angered over the seizure of a 'Muslim' ship.
SNT.117023.676	The tanker is anchored near Haradheere, a town controlled by the Islamists.
SNT.117023.677	The Sirius Star, owned by Saudi state firm Vela International Marine, has a crew of 25 from the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Croatia, Poland, and Britain.
SNT.117023.678	A ransom of $25 million is being sought, a quarter of the value of the vessel's cargo of oil.
SNT.117023.679	"Hijacking a Muslim ship is a major crime," said militant spokesman Sheikh Abdi Rihin Isse Adow.
SNT.117023.680	Spokesman Abdirahim Isse Adow said: "We have arranged our fighters."
SNT.117023.681	"The first step is to cut off pirates inland from those on the Saudi ship by restricting their supplies and cutting their communications."
SNT.117023.682	They could have a fight on their hands, as the pirates have also been bringing in fighters in preparation for possible military attacks from various foreign navies that have arrived in the area to combat the growing threat from pirates.
SNT.117023.683	"I hope the owner of the tanker is wise enough and won't allow any military option because that would be disastrous for everybody.
SNT.117023.684	"We are here to defend the tanker if attacked," said pirate Abdiyare Moalim.
SNT.117023.685	91 ships have been attacked by pirates in the Gulf of Arden since the year began, but the Sirius Star is both the largest and furthest from shore to be taken, captured some 420 nautical miles (833 kilometers) from Somalia's coast.
SNT.117023.686	The news is not entirely bad, however, as a Greek tanker full of refined oil was released today, complete with cargo intact and crew of 19 unharmed.
SNT.117023.687	The MV Genius, now headed out of the area, was captured September 26, the same day as the MV Faina was taken.
SNT.117023.688	The Faina remains held with a cargo of military hardware including tanks.

SNT.265224.693	Much of the town centre was sealed off during this incident.
SNT.265224.694	According to a statement from Hertfordshire Constabulary: "Safety of members of the public was paramount and a cordon was put in place and people were evacuated from nearby premises."
SNT.265224.695	"There will be police activity in the town centre for a while to come."
SNT.265224.696	"Understandably this caused concern within the community and we would like to thank members of the public for their co-operation in this matter."
SNT.265224.697	The spokeswoman has reported that the alleged criminal "has been arrested and will be taken to police custody for interview" and that "[i]nvestigations into the nature of this device will continue".
SNT.104797.698	Complex 40 was first used in 1965, for the maiden flight of the Titan IIIC rocket.
SNT.104797.699	Following the second Titan III launch, it was modified to serve as a launch pad for the US Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL).
SNT.104797.700	In November 1966, a boilerplate MOL space station was launched on a Titan IIIC from the complex, along with a Gemini capsule, and four satellites.
SNT.104797.701	Following the cancellation of MOL, it was converted back to a regular Titan launch complex, and was used for 55 launches, of Titan IIIC, 34D, and IV rockets.
SNT.104797.702	Two planetary probes, two commercial satellites, a British military communications satellite, and numerous payloads for the American armed forces were launched from the complex, which ceased operations in April 2005, when the penultimate Titan IV launched the Lacrosse-5 spy satellite for America's National Reconnaissance Office.
SNT.104797.703	Along with Launch Complex 41, which was demolished in 1999, LC-40 was used for heavy-lift Titan rocket launches.
SNT.104797.704	The Mars Observer and Cassini-Huygens missions to Mars and Saturn respectively were launched from Complex 40.
SNT.104797.705	The launch pad is being demolished to make way for a new complex, which will be used by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, currently scheduled to make its maiden flight in 2009.
SNT.104797.706	As well as being used for commercial launches, the new LC-40 will be used for cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, under a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) contract with NASA.
SNT.104797.707	It could eventually be used for manned missions using the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.
SNT.104797.708	SpaceX currently has a five year lease on the site.
SNT.43050.709	President George W. Bush has made a surprise visit to Iraq hoping to bolster some support.
SNT.43050.710	He also went to meet their new Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and talk about next steps in the war.
SNT.43050.711	Even al-Maliki didn't know that Bush was coming until five minutes before he arrived.
SNT.43050.712	The trip comes as over 70,000 mostly Iraqi citizens prepare to deploy into Baghdad to try and bring security to the capital.
SNT.43050.713	It was a very dramatic move by the president to travel to a violence crazed area in Baghdad less than a week after the death of al-Zarqawi.
SNT.43050.714	Bush met with al-Maliki in a very well forified green zone in a palace once used by Saddam Hussien.
SNT.31094.715	Quaero is being termed eurozone's response to the US-based internet search giants such as Google, Yahoo and MSN.
SNT.31094.716	The project includes the French and German governments along with a host of European technology companies such as Thomson, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
SNT.31094.717	It is scheduled to be submitted to France's Agency of Industrial Innovation later this month.
SNT.31094.718	The agency which has a budget of €2 billion ($2.41 billion) hasn't specified how much of this money will be spent on Quaero.
SNT.31094.719	President Jacques Chirac announced the launch of Quaero during the French-German ministerial conference in April of last year.
SNT.31094.720	It is the latest in a series of initiatives by the Europeans to compete with US dominance in technology.
SNT.31094.721	Europe launched the Galileo satellite navigation system last month aimed at rivaling a similar system already available in the US.
SNT.31094.722	French broadcasters are also planning an international television network, CFII aimed at presenting the French view on world events.
SNT.31094.723	The network is slated to begin broadcasting in French and English to Europe, the Middle East and Africa sometime next year.
SNT.31094.724	Designers hope that Quaero will be the world's most advanced multimedia search engine to locate and translate video and audio over the internet.
SNT.31094.725	None of the key players has commented on cost and last week, Thomson, removed access to the page on its corporate web site devoted to Quaero and instructed its executives not to give any interviews for the project.
SNT.31094.726	Most industry experts remain skeptical and fear that the program would be costly and unwieldy to administer and would produce no tangible commercial advances.
SNT.31094.727	"I'm not too confident that Quaero will be able to produce anything that the private sector isn't already offering or will develop on its own in the future," said John Lervik, chief executive of Fast Search & Transfer, a Norwegian software company that provides search solutions to businesses for data stored on their corporate networks.
SNT.130581.728	In what police believe is the second-largest heist in Britain, armed robbers stole almost £40 million from a London jewellery shop on August 6.
SNT.130581.729	Two men armed with handguns held up employees of the Graff jewellers shop on New Bond Street, taking 43 items, among them expensive watches, bracelets, and rings.
SNT.130581.730	The duo escaped in a blue BMW, which they soon abandoned for a Mercedes.
SNT.130581.731	After driving to Farm Street, it is believed they may have got away in a third vehicle.
SNT.130581.732	"This was a well planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape.
SNT.130581.733	"These men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy London streets as they made their getaway," said Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace.
SNT.130581.734	"Someone knows who these men are, they would undoubtedly have spoken about it beforehand or boasted about it afterwards," she added.
SNT.130581.735	"I would urge anyone who recognises them, knows the whereabouts of the jewellery or has any other information to contact us."
SNT.144359.736	The governing body of world football, FIFA, has threatened Iraq with expulsion after the Iraqi Olympic Committee (IOC) took control of the country's governing body of football and disbanded it.
SNT.144359.737	FIFA has given the country 72 hours to restore the Iraq Football Association (IFA); if this is not done, the case is to be referred to FIFA's emergency committee.
SNT.144359.738	The IFA and the IOC have disputed over who controls the game in the country for several years.
SNT.144359.739	The IOC has blamed the IFA for the FIFA ban on the country not being allowed to host international friendly matches due to security reasons.
SNT.144359.740	Since the 2003 invasion by American forces, Iraq has hosted two internationals matches, both against Palestine.
SNT.144359.741	They are due to play against the United Arab Emirates tomorrow, but the general ban still remains in place.
SNT.144359.742	A statement was released on the FIFA website said: "FIFA appeals once more to all stakeholders in Iraq to respect the autonomy of sport in general and the IFA in particular and to allow IFA to conduct its affairs according its statutes and those of FIFA."
SNT.144359.743	Should the case be passed over to FIFA's emergency committee, it would most likely result in a ban from the sport.
SNT.25279.744	Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin accused the Transnistrian authorities on Saturday of having supplied Russian weapons to Iraq during the regime of Saddam Hussein, Russian news agencies have said.
SNT.25279.745	Chisinau "holds official documents from the chancellery of Saddam Hussein, which show that Transnistria had supplied both arms, and entire weapon manufacturing lines to Iraq," Voronin told a group of Russian journalists, adding that an investigation on this case is under way.
SNT.25279.746	"Russia's control over this territory is obvious and we must call to account those who do not desire to solve this conflict", Voronin added.
SNT.25279.747	Being asked what Russia must do to help solve the conflict, the Moldovan President said that it must take the munitions from that territory.
SNT.25279.748	"We consider this depot a political shield that supports the Transnistrian regime," the President emphasized.
SNT.25279.749	Voronin added Moldova can prove Tiraspol sold weapons to Iraq.
SNT.25279.750	"The document from Hussein's archive that can confirm this is being studied by the Moldovan authorities now," he said.
SNT.25279.751	Voronin accused Moscow to settle this regional conflict, noting that Russian weapons are "a political coverage to protect the Transnistrian regime."
SNT.25279.752	The Moldovan leader noted that he has sent a package of documents to Russia regarding the activity of 13 Transnistrian military companies.
SNT.25279.753	On the other hand, Moldovan Premier Vasile Tarlev accused Thursday the Russian troops in Transnistria of supplying weapons to the Chechen region, In reply, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov said that he "pledges his head" for Russian bases in Moldova, and assured that "no weapons from Transnistria had been sent."
SNT.43554.754	New Zealand farmers have won a key victory in Parliament, with MPs voting to exempt Working farm dogs from microchipping legislation, passing 61:60.
SNT.43554.755	The Federated Farmers debated the law for a long time, saying that the cost of microchipping all their dogs will be a huge cost and an inconvenience.
SNT.43554.756	Under previous legislation, all newly registered dogs were to have identification microchips embedded by July 1.
SNT.43554.757	The microchips in dogs are for owner identification, in case of attacks on humans.
SNT.43554.758	This law was introduced when Carolina Anderson, 7-year-old, was attacked in 2003.
SNT.43554.759	Parliament has been debating several proposed amendments to the Local Government Law Reform bill, which aimed to change the microchipping requirement.
SNT.43554.760	Blogger David Farrar says "It is very messy for the Government to lose the vote after piling so much pressure on."
SNT.43554.761	In the end only Labour, Progressive plus New Zealand First voted for it.
SNT.43554.762	Four Greens MPs voted for the farm dog exemption and two against.
SNT.43554.763	The Greens had previously proposed that only dangerous dogs should be microchipped.
SNT.62727.764	Although the United States experienced average temperatures for the December, 2006 to February, 2007 period, overall world temperatures were the warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
SNT.62727.765	In a March 15, 2007 report, the NOAA indicated that a record warm January helped push the combined global land and ocean surface temperature for the past winter to its highest value since records began in 1880.
SNT.62727.766	The ocean-atmosphere system, El Niño, played a part in the season's record warmth, according to the report's authors, but its effects did not last long, as ocean temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific cooled more than 0.3 degrees C in February and were near average for the month.
SNT.62727.767	The global land-surface temperature was the warmest on record, while the ocean-surface temperature tied for second warmest in the past 128 year period, approximately 0.06 degrees C cooler than the record established during the strong El Niño episode of 1997-1998.
SNT.62727.768	During the past century, global surface temperatures have increased approximately 0.06 degrees C per decade, but since 1976 the rate of increase has been about 0.18 degrees C per decade.
SNT.62727.769	The greatest temperature increase occurred in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.
SNT.62727.770	In an interview with Reuters, Jay Lawrimore of NOAA suggested that the data does not show greenhouse gases had an influence on the recent temperature increases, but acknowledges that by "looking at long-term trends and long-term changes, we are able to better understand natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change."
SNT.62727.771	A U.S. Commerce Department agency based in Washington, D.C., the NOAA conducts research and gathers data on oceans and atmosphere.
SNT.62727.772	The NOAA is a participant in the Group on Earth Observations, GEO, an intergovernmental effort to coordinate the collection of Earth observations worldwide.
SNT.56352.773	Russia Today TV, Moscow's English-language satellite television channel, reported that Russian government officials are considering filing libel suits against international journalists over their reporting on the poisoning death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko.
SNT.56352.774	Litvinenko was a strong critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and shortly before he died in London from radiation poisoning in late November, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering his assassination.
SNT.56352.775	Putin and other Russian officials strongly denied any prior knowledge of a plot to kill Litvinenko.
SNT.56352.776	According to a report posted late Friday on the Russia Today TV web site, the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Media is gathering publications worldwide to be studied for libelous and offensive comments against Russia in their coverage of the Litvinenko's case.
SNT.56352.777	Russia Today TV reported that the Russian government intends to file law suits for libel against international media if there is evidence of journalistic misconduct.
SNT.56352.778	In a Voice of America interview shortly before he was poisoned by a radioactive substance polonium-210, former Russian spy Litvinenko had accused Putin of ordering the murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya to silence her and intimidate other independent journalists.
SNT.56352.779	She had been killed by an unknown assailant in Moscow in early October.
SNT.56352.780	Several senior Russian politicians have said that the deaths of Politkovskaya and Litvinenko were playing into the hands of Russia's enemies and, therefore, could not have been authorized by Moscow.
SNT.56352.781	The Russian government's warnings aimed at international journalists follow Putin's largely successful efforts to bring major media outlets in Russia under government control and to limit media criticism of his policies.
SNT.56352.782	Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based nongovernmental organization, has called Putin one of the world's top "Predators of Press Freedom."
SNT.56352.783	FreeMediaOnline.org, a California-based nonprofit organization which monitors media and supports press freedom worldwide, said that the latest warnings issued by the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Media would prove a major embarrassment for Putin and for Russia if they were carried out.
SNT.56352.784	An article on the FreeMediaOnline.org web site claims that even if there is no direct link between the two assassinations and the Kremlin, Putin is ultimately responsible for the climate of lawlessness and suppression of free media that may have contributed to these murders.
SNT.56352.785	FreeMediaOnline.org also noted that uncovering the truth about the murders of Politkovskaya and Litvinenko would be difficult because independent journalists in Russia have been either silenced or intimidated by President Putin's media advisors, government regulators, and security services.
SNT.56352.786	Putin insists he is a strong supporter of democracy and press freedom.
SNT.56352.787	In a speech to Russian television broadcasters in late November 2006, Putin said that the development of Russian state and society would be unthinkable without independent media, without the possibility of listening to different points of view, and without television.
SNT.56352.788	Putin's critics point out that he has successfully placed under the Kremlin's control all major nationwide television channels.
SNT.56352.789	According to FreeMediaOnline.org, journalists working for these channels no longer dare to offer any significant criticism of Mr. Putin's policies.
SNT.56352.790	The organization warned that restrictions on media freedom in Russia have emboldened criminal elements to engage in illegal activities.
SNT.141305.791	American singer and actor Al Martino died yesterday, aged 82.
SNT.141305.792	Martino was born as Alfred Cini in Philadelphia, US state of Pennsylvania on October 7, 1927.
SNT.141305.793	One of the ways in which he was best known was for his first single, "Here in My Heart", which became the first ever number 1 single in the UK Singles Chart on November 14, 1952.
SNT.141305.794	It stayed at the top spot for nine weeks before being succeeded by "You Belong To Me" by Jo Stafford.
SNT.141305.795	More recently, Martino was known was for his character Johnny Fontane in the 1972 film The Godfather.
SNT.141305.796	He reprised the role in the sequel films The Godfather II and The Godfather III.
SNT.141305.797	Martino died at his childhood hometown of Philadelphia, following an active 58 years in the music business.
SNT.76050.798	The British actor Chris Langham has been found guilty on 15 counts of downloading child pornography.
SNT.76050.799	A jury of four women and seven men took two hours and forty minutes to reach a verdict at Maidstone Crown Court.
SNT.76050.800	Judge Philip Statman said that Langham will remain in custody till his sentencing on September 14.
SNT.76050.801	Langham, 58, from Goldford, Kent claimed that he had been studying porn sites, researching for a character called, "Pedro," for the television series Help.
SNT.76050.802	However, co-star Paul Whitehouse claimed he had no knowledge of this research.
SNT.76050.803	Langham refused to answer questions about certain images found on his computer.
SNT.76050.804	During his time in court, Langham claimed that he was abused at the age of eight during a holiday to Canada.
SNT.76050.805	He also said his brothers and sisters were abused, and that he felt no shame at looking at child pornography.
SNT.76050.806	Langham said he pleaded not guilty because he did not want to be labelled a, "Paedophile".
SNT.76050.807	Langham however was cleared of charges of indecently assaulting an underage girl.
SNT.76050.808	The girl claimed that Langham took her virginity at the age of 14, but Judge Statman said, "The Crown accepts that there is no evidence to support these particular counts on the indictment."
SNT.76050.809	Langham said, in a statement read out by his solicitor, "I am absolutely delighted my name has been cleared of all the charges I have consistently denied."
SNT.76050.810	"I have been found guilty on charges I have made admission to from the moment of my first arrest."
SNT.76050.811	"I am grateful to the jury for their careful deliberation and I would also like to thank the press for their restraint in not making the lives of my wife, children and family difficult during this time and I implore them to continue to grant my family the privacy they need."
SNT.76050.812	"I am afraid I am unable to comment further until sentence on the 14 September."
SNT.76050.813	Derek Cuff, Deputy Inspector of Kent Police said, "Let us not forget that child abuse images circulating on the internet are real situations involving real children, who are sexually abused for other's gain and self-gratification."
SNT.76050.814	The jury had to view some images that had to be selected carefully - but what they saw and heard in evidence is harrowing and disturbing.
SNT.76050.815	"I think this itself puts some measure of perspective on the level of child abuse we are dealing with."
SNT.76050.816	This will affect the filming of the next series of the satirical sitcom The Thick of It, where Langham plays Hugh Abbot MP.
SNT.76050.817	The last two special episodes did not star Langham due to his arrest.
SNT.76050.818	Writer Armando Iannucci hoped that if Langham was found not guilty, he would be able to appear in his show again.
SNT.55329.819	As of 9 am this morning, flaring is still being carried out by ExxonMobil at Jurong Island, Singapore.
SNT.55329.820	This is the 3rd day flaring works are being carried out by the company to burn off excess fuel from the refinery plant.
SNT.55329.821	The flame, according to Ms Eva Ho, Communications Manager of ExxonMobil, is dying.
SNT.55329.822	ExxonMobil wishes to assure members of the public that no health risk is posed as water and carbon dioxide are produced as a result of the flaring.
SNT.55329.823	Meng Yew Choong, Assistant Director of Corporate Communication at the National Environment Agency also clarifies:
SNT.55329.824	"The hydrocarbon gases are burnt safely into water vapour and carbon dioxide, both harmless gases.
SNT.55329.825	Regular STOMP contributor Mike Muk shot a video of the flaring as well and he sent it in to Stomp.
SNT.55329.826	STOMPer NZSheep also sent a picture to a website, offering the closest look of the flaring activity, taken just outside the security fences surrounding Jurong Island.
SNT.84497.827	A leading Queensland union says that the Melbourne Cup due to be run tomorrow at 3:00pm Australian Eastern Daylight Saving Time could be used as a valuable educational tool in the classroom.
SNT.84497.828	The Queensland Teachers Union president Steve Ryan said that he supported staff making their own decisions on whether to watch the race but statistics principles could be taught in conjunction with showing the race.
SNT.84497.829	Mr Ryan said that incorporating the Cup into the curriculum would make statistics 'real' to work with, rather than using textbook material.
SNT.84497.830	"It's about making subjects real and certainly that's a good example of how you can use a particular situation."
SNT.84497.831	Many religious schools in Brisbane have chosen not to show the race due to gambling concerns.
SNT.3801.832	Hamas, a radical islamist party, has won by a large majority in the Gaza Strip council elections held last month.
SNT.3801.833	Hamas won 75 out of the 118 seats, with Fatah, the party of Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas only managing to secure 39 seats.
SNT.3801.834	Of the ten council areas in Gaza, Hamas has control of seven.
SNT.3801.835	Fathiya Barghouti Rheime, a 30-year-old high school teacher, and mother of two, was one of the seven Hamas mayors elected in the Gaza strip.
SNT.3801.836	She has become the second female mayor of a Palestinian community, and the first ever elected one.
SNT.3801.837	"It's a sign of change," she said. 
SNT.3801.837-1	"I'm deeply concerned about transmitting the picture of the active Islamic woman to the world, to wipe away the blemish of the veil."
SNT.3801.838	In the West Bank, Female candidates won 52 of 306 seats.
SNT.3801.839	Two and a half times the number of seats that had been reserved for women.
SNT.35116.840	Environmental scientists say they have concrete evidence that the planet is undergoing the "largest mass extinction in 65 million years".
SNT.35116.841	Leading environmental scientist Professor Norman Myers says the Earth is experiencing its "Sixth Extinction."
SNT.35116.842	Scientists forecast that up to five million species will be lost this century.
SNT.35116.843	"We are well into the opening phase of a mass extinction of species. "
SNT.35116.844	"If we carry on as we are, we could lose half of all those 10 million species," Myers said.
SNT.35116.845	"If we do not do more," Myers says, "the planet will continue to lose around 50 species per day compared to the natural extinction rate of one species every five years."
SNT.35116.846	He projected this rate in the late 1980s to much criticism, but the figure is now widely accepted by scientists.
SNT.35116.847	"The whole thing is taking place in what you might call a flickering of an evolutionary eye," said Myers.
SNT.35116.848	"It's hard to keep up with unless we damp down on some of the causes of the evolution."
SNT.45863.849	More than 650 people have now died after a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Java on Monday afternoon.
SNT.45863.850	In the past few days, around 100 dead bodies have been recovered, and it is estimated that over 300 people are still missing.
SNT.45863.851	An underwater earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 triggered the deadly wave which ravaged a 200km stretch of Java's southern coast.
SNT.45863.852	Thousands of people are continuing to camp in the hills.
SNT.45863.853	They are too apprehensive to return home due to fears of another tsunami, but according to Reuters, health officials are worried about the threat of disease among those who are still in refuge.
SNT.45863.854	"The risk of catching diseases is there because they live in an open area with limited tents and water," said Rustan Pakaya, from the health ministry's crisis centre.
SNT.45863.855	He added that people were being given injections to protect them from diseases like measles, tetanus and cholera.
SNT.45863.856	Areas worst hit, like the small town of Pangandaran, are beginning to return to normal, and many businesses there have begun to open up again.
SNT.45863.857	"The market and many shops are already open today and although they are not operating fully, things are slowly returning to normal," district spokesman Wasdi bin Umri told AFP.
SNT.45863.858	Yesterday, Indonesia's President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono toured Pangandaran and met people who were staying in a temporary camp.
SNT.45863.859	The Indonesian government has been criticised for failing to inform residents living on the coast that a tsunami was looming.
SNT.45863.860	After the underwater earthquake was detected, US and Japanese agencies issued warning notices, but the government has admitted it was unable to transmit the bulletins to coastal areas.
SNT.45863.861	Speaking yesterday, Mr Yudhoyono vowed to hasten efforts to build an early warning system planned after the 2004 Asian tsunami.
SNT.45863.862	"We want to expedite efforts to get infrastructure for the tsunami warning system in place," AP quoted him as saying.
SNT.42997.863	His announcement came after a similar initiative by Maharashtra and a day after Union Petroleum Minister Murli Deora met him in Chennai.
SNT.42997.864	A couple of days ago, the Chief Minister had said that any reduction in the sales tax could result in the bus fares going up.
SNT.42997.865	In the statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said the rising crude oil prices globally necessitated an increase in fuel prices.
SNT.42997.866	It had become routine for the ruling party to explain the circumstances leading to the increase and the Opposition to protest.
SNT.42997.867	The upward revision in petrol and diesel prices was being talked about by the Centre for some months now, but was put on hold.
SNT.42997.868	The Centre, he said, had little option but to increase the price despite some of the coalition partners opposing the move and even the President of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party) Sonia Gandhi not favouring it.
SNT.42997.869	While a reduction in levies on petroleum products by the Centre and the State Government was a temporary solution, the long-term solution was to reduce consumption of petroleum products and promote research on their alternatives.
SNT.42997.870	In a statement, AIADMK General Secretary Jayalalithaa said the State Government could reduce the price burden by reducing the sales tax on petrol and diesel.
SNT.42997.871	Noting that it was not her suggestion but what Mr. Karunanidhi had given when she was Chief Minister, she said the Centre had recently said that such a move could reduce the impact of petrol and diesel price increase.
SNT.46405.872	The massive surge of hot air that has plagued the West and Midwest during last week has now moved over the eastern seaboard of the United States.
SNT.46405.873	Residents are bracing themselves for what could be record breaking temperatures.
SNT.46405.874	Many cities are already struggling due to power outages from mid-July's Heat Wave, particularly some in the Queens and Staten Island in New York City.
SNT.46405.875	Consolidated Edison, the power supplier for the New York City area, has reported that many customers are still without power.
SNT.46405.876	They urge customers to lighten the load on power usage to help avoid further service interruption.
SNT.46405.877	Baltimore, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia are all expecting highs to reach above 100ºF (37.8ºC).
SNT.46405.878	The National Weather Service has posted Excessive Heat Warnings for many of the cities in the eastern seaboard that do not normally experience this type of dangerously hot weather.
SNT.46405.879	On Tuesday August 1, 2006 according to The Weather Channel, New York City will have a high temperature of 98ºF in Central Park, however other areas in the New York City area are expected to rise above 100ºF.
SNT.46405.880	Philadelphia will reach 100ºF, Washington D.C. will have a high of 101ºF and Baltimore and Richmond may see temperatures rise above the 100 mark.
SNT.46405.881	To exacerbate the situation, heat indices are expected to reach well over the 110s for much of the east coast due to high humidity levels.
SNT.46405.882	An Air Stagnation Advisory has also been issued for much of the urban areas on the eastern seaboard and "BosWash", as rain is expected to be very minimal through Thursday.
SNT.46405.883	Many residents say this heat is unheard of as temperatures are expected to be higher than that of Florida and some parts of Texas, where it is typically hotter.
SNT.46405.884	The oppressive and dangerously high temperatures will remain this way well into Thursday afternoon, according to meteorologists, when a cool front is expected to move in and provide much needed relief.
SNT.109620.885	Six people have been killed after a bus carrying Polish tourists crashed in Serbia.
SNT.109620.886	The accident happened yesterday on a road north of Belgrade that led to Novi Sad.
SNT.109620.887	The bus had been taking the tourists home after a trip to Bulgaria.
SNT.109620.888	Of a total of sixty-eight on the bus, around forty are injured, although exact figures are unclear.
SNT.109620.889	All the victims are passengers, as the owner of the vehicle's operator Moana, Josef Rzepka, said both of the drivers on board escaped unhurt.
SNT.109620.890	A Reuters photograph shows the bus lying on its right side next to what appears to be a straight stretch of road.
SNT.109620.891	There is a slight slope under the bus and its rear end appears to have reached the bottom of the drop, crushing the roof at the back of the bus.
SNT.109620.892	It is not yet clear what caused the bus to swerve off the road, but as the crash occurred at 6:30 a.m. local time the driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel.
SNT.109620.893	There are also allegations that the double-decker bus may have been in a poor state of repair.
SNT.109620.894	The father of one victim said that the vehicle's windscreen wipers were taped together and the paintwork had been done by a brush instead of sprayed on.
SNT.109620.895	He also said that his daughter had reported rain leaking through the buses roof.
SNT.109620.896	Polish media also says some parents were concerned by the bus before they sent their children on the journey, although others say the bus appeared mechanically safe.
SNT.109620.897	Regardless, the bus has been removed with a crane and subjected to a technical examination by police.
SNT.109620.898	Poland supplied a military aircraft to transport relatives into Serbia.
SNT.109620.899	The crash is the worst in the area since a disaster in April 2004 that saw a Bulgarian coach returning from a journey to Croatia crashed into the Lim river, leaving twelve students dead.
SNT.109620.900	Road accidents are common in Serbia as regulations are commonly ignored.
SNT.109620.901	New legislation has been proposed to fine violators more heavily, but has yet to be implemented.
SNT.30349.902	Two suspected robbers west of Kissimmee, Florida released one hostage after negotiating with sheriffs' deputies.
SNT.30349.903	Police later shot and killed one bank robber and arrested a second on after a 10 hour stand-off with police.
SNT.30349.904	"A sniper shot the male suspect while the female was in custody," said Osceola County Sheriff Bob Hansell.
SNT.30349.905	The suspects had escaped the Mercantile Bank, a mile west of Walt Disney World's Wide World of Sports, with one hostage after authorities blasted through the rear door using an explosive device.
SNT.30349.906	But police soon cornered them in their getaway car, authorities said.
SNT.30349.907	The male suspect then "used the hostage again as a shield to get into another vehicle," Hansell said.
SNT.30349.908	"He tried to leave again and at that point he was taken down by one of our snipers."
SNT.30349.909	Deputies had been using cell phones to negotiate with the suspects, who were wearing masks, wigs and coats.
SNT.30349.910	Around 7:15 p.m. EST, police blasted through the bank's rear door.
SNT.30349.911	The suspects escaped with a female hostage and drove away in a bank employee's car, but they traveled less than a mile before street barricades stopped them.
SNT.30349.912	Shots were fired at deputies but nobody was hurt, police said.
SNT.30349.913	The suspects had been holed up in the bank since Tuesday morning.
SNT.30349.914	The first hostage was released when the robbers panicked when deputies arrived so quickly after the robbery, said sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain.
SNT.30349.915	The second was freed in exchange for cigarettes and the third after deputies agreed to back their vehicles a few feet farther away from the bank, Lizasuain said.
SNT.30349.916	Police did not release the names the hostages, but the suspects were identified Wednesday as a 50-year-old male, Gaetano Alessandrello, and a 26-year old woman, Amanda Lynn Moeller.
SNT.30349.917	It was not immediately clear whether the suspects ever got any money.
SNT.30349.918	Tourists near the bank, in hotels, were confined to them for hours as police asked them "to stay indoors".
SNT.30349.919	The hostages said they were treated well and were not threatened with violence, Hansell said.
SNT.30349.920	The same bank was robbed just 2 months ago on November 16, 2005.
SNT.30349.921	It is unclear if the two robberies are connected or not.
SNT.151790.922	Clare Short, the United Kingdom's then-Secretary of State for International Development, appeared before the Iraq Inquiry yesterday, and told the panel that the Cabinet was "misled" about the Iraq War's legality prior to the 2003 invasion.
SNT.151790.923	The three-hour session was held in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London's City of Westminster.
SNT.151790.924	Short, an outspoken critic of the war, retired from the cabinet to become an independent MP two months before the invasion.
SNT.151790.925	She claimed to have been "conned" into staying on despite her doubts about the war and told the inquiry that the Cabinet, of which she was a part, was not a "decision-making body", and that Parliament was simply a "rubber stamp".
SNT.64687.926	Bangladesh pulled off a surprising victory over South Africa by 67 runs in the Super 8 phase of the World Cup at the Providence Stadium, Georgetown, Guyana.
SNT.58391.927	The U.S. armed forces detained five Iranians working at a "liaison office" located in Erbil, Iraq before dawn on Friday.
SNT.58391.928	Sources said that the U.S. forces first landed their helicopters around the building, then broke through the office's gate, disarmed the guards, confiscated some documents and certain objects, arrested five suspected terrorists, and then left for an undisclosed location.
SNT.58391.929	However, there was no raid on the Iranian Consulate General as earlier reported.
SNT.58391.930	Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told Agence France-Presse that the building raided was "not a consulate or a government building", which appears to be confirmed by the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, who said the Iranians were working at an office that had government approval and was in the process of being approved as a consulate, but was not a Consulate nor the Iranian Consulate General.
SNT.58391.931	The US is strategically insisting that they raided a "liaison office" instead of a Consulate to avoid being found in violation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
SNT.58391.932	Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Kamynin said that the raid was absolutely unacceptable and was a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
SNT.58391.933	The Kurdistan Regional Government also expressed their shock and disapproval of the raid.
SNT.58391.934	On Thursday's hearing on Iraq, Senator Joseph Biden (D-Delware), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the Bush Administration did not have the authority to send U.S. troops on cross-border raids.
SNT.58391.935	Biden said, "I believe the present authorization granted the president to use force in Iraq does not cover that, and he does need congressional authority to do that."
SNT.58391.936	After the meeting, Biden sent a follow-up letter to the White House asking for an explanation from the Bush Administration on the matter.
SNT.58391.937	On Thursday morning, Iran's foreign ministry official sent a letter to Iraq's foreign ministry asking Iraq to stop the Bush Administration from interfering with Iraq-Iran relations, and has protested the raid on its liaison office.
SNT.58391.938	The official said, "We expect the Iraqi government to take immediate measures to set the aforesaid individuals free and to condemn the U.S. troopers for the measure."
SNT.58391.939	"Following up on the case and releasing the arrestees is a responsibility of primarily the Iraqi government and then the local government and officials of the Iraqi Kurdistan."
SNT.109167.940	This past Tuesday, a United States federal judge ordered the popular video sharing website YouTube to hand over a record of every video that users have watched, including registered accounts and IPs.
SNT.109167.941	Viacom, which owns several U.S. television networks such as MTV and Nickelodeon, launched a $1 billion lawsuit last year alleging that YouTube wasn't doing enough to stop its copyrighted material from appearing in over 160,000 unauthorized clips that have been viewed over 1.5 billion times.
SNT.109167.942	Viacom argued that since they claimed that copyright material is more popular than user-made videos, they needed access to the information to strengthen the case, in which US District Court judge Louis L. Stanton agreed and ordered Google to turn over such information.
SNT.109167.943	Google argued that this would cause privacy issues, but Stanton said it was just speculation.
SNT.109167.944	The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based privacy advocate group, said the ruling was "a setback to privacy rights, and will allow Viacom to see what you are watching on YouTube." said EFF's senior staff attorney Kurt Opsahl.
SNT.109167.945	Viacom had also requested for the code used to search keywords for each video and access to Google's advertising database to see if Google was receiving revenue from ads from the alleged videos, but these requests were denied by the judge, arguing that code and ad data was too valuable.
SNT.109167.946	There are concerns that Google is violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act which allows a video provider service to not to be sued if it removes copyrighted material.
SNT.41349.947	After a referendum, the Montenegro region of Serbia and Montenegro declares independence to form the new Republic of Montenegro.
SNT.41349.948	Unlike other Balkan states such as Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, Montenegro has achieved independence without violence.
SNT.41349.949	"I am convinced Montenegro could be the next country from this region to join the European Union, after Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, which are further along the process," says Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who has promoted Montenegro's independence.
SNT.41349.950	It is also predicted that Montenegro will join the United Nations in September.
SNT.41349.951	The referendum, with an 86.3% voter turnout, had a 55.4% approval for the secession, which satisfies the European Union's minimum 55% approval.
SNT.41349.952	With a population of 650,000, Montenegro is the world's newest country.
SNT.41349.953	Serbia reluctantly agreed to the split, and the European Union approved.
SNT.41349.954	Despite expectations, there were no riots that night; however, early celebrations had occurred in the capital Podgorica based off of expected results.
SNT.41349.955	This is the first time Montenegro has been independent since 1916, when it became a part of Austro-Hungary.
SNT.41349.956	Soon Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia together formed "Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians", which later changed the name into Kingdom Yugoslavia.
SNT.41349.957	In 1991 and 1992 four of six Yugoslavian republics declared independence but two, Serbia and Montenegro, remained together.
SNT.41349.958	Some analysts note that Serbia and Montenegro has not functioned as one state since the Belgrade agreement, signed three years ago.
SNT.41349.959	Each republic had separate anthems, laws, and currencies and their joint parliament did not meet very often.
SNT.87163.960	Fabio Capello has emerged as the new favourite to succeed Steve McClaren as the England football team's new head coach after José Mourinho ruled himself out of taking the job.
SNT.87163.961	The former Chelsea manager had been widely regarded as a favourite for the job but after he admitted yesterday that he is no longer interested in it, Capello became the new favourite.
SNT.87163.962	The Italian, who has previously managed Real Madrid, AC Milan, Juventus and Roma, would regard the England job as the highlight of his career according to sources close to him and is ready to open talks.
SNT.87163.963	Other candidates for the job include fellow Italian Marcello Lippi, former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann and Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill.
SNT.57820.964	In what is becoming an annual phenomenon in France, 400 cars were set ablaze during the New Year's night.
SNT.57820.965	In 2006, an average of 112 cars a day were torched across France.
SNT.57820.966	There were 15 attacks per day on police and emergency services.
SNT.57820.967	Almost 3,000 police officers were injured in clashes with residents.
SNT.57820.968	In four separate ambushes, officers were badly injured in the Paris suburbs since September.
SNT.57820.969	Police speak of open war with youths who are bent on more than vandalism.
SNT.62327.970	The lead singer of Boston, Brad Delp was found dead in his house alone last Friday.
SNT.62327.971	The Atkinson police have stated that there was no "foul play" involved, and the cause was still under investigation by the medical examiner.
SNT.62327.972	After the death, the bands website went down and was replaced with the message: "We just lost the nicest guy in rock and roll."
SNT.62327.973	Delp joined Boston in the ealry 70's after meeting with guitarist, songwriter and producer Tom Scholz.
SNT.62327.974	Their first album, which was self titled, was a huge success.
SNT.62327.975	The album had hits on it such as "Long Time" and "More than a Feeling".
SNT.62327.976	Delp left the band in 1991, and was replaced by Fran Cosmo.
SNT.62327.977	Delp rejoined the band later for the Walk On tour, and shared vocal duties with Cosmo.
SNT.62327.978	A new album with Delp singing was reported to have been in the making, but no release date was ever given.
SNT.118836.979	Amidst ongoing Israeli bombings of Gaza, with the death toll of the bombardments up to 537 with another 2,500 people wounded, UN food agencies again warned that the people of Gaza are facing a heavy humanitarian crisis.
SNT.118836.980	"The current situation in Gaza is appalling, and many basic food items are no longer available on the market," Said Christine van Nieuwenhuyse, the World Food Program's (WFP) representative in the Palestinian territory, in a statement that was released on Friday.
SNT.118836.981	"This area ... is one of the poorest and most heavily affected by the recent conflict," she added.
SNT.118836.982	WFP officials said that they have begun to give bread to 15,000 new recipients, a number which added to the already large group of people that had been lining up for bread after two years of Israeli blockades of Gaza, the most recent of which began in early November.
SNT.118836.983	The blockades, surely a catalyst for violent Hamas attacks, have been condemned by Human Rights Watch as a "violation of international humanitarian law."
SNT.118836.984	Struggling Gazan hospitals say that they are completely out of even the most basic medical supplies and have little or no capacity to deal with further casualties.
SNT.118836.985	In addition, Israeli ground forces entered Gaza on Saturday causing an immediate spike in casualties and even attacks on the hospitals and paramedics themselves.
SNT.118836.986	As sewage runs through the streets, many Gazans are trying to flee the area by storming the border with Egypt, a move which Egyptian police blocked on Sunday and are planning to do so again today as Egyptian leaders ordered their policemen to open fire on Gazans trying to flee into Egypt.
SNT.118836.987	Hasan Khalaf, Gaza's assistant deputy health minister, described the ongoing assault on Gaza as "an Israeli massacre".
SNT.118836.988	"There is no comparison between what we have and what [Israel] are doing to us."
SNT.118836.989	"The international community are standing unable to help us, and yet we know they have been helping Israel for tens of years."
SNT.7672.990	Pope John Paul II has a Brazilian cousin living in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
SNT.7672.991	Bolessuaf, 86, likes to read the card written in Polish that he received from his cousin, the Pope.
SNT.7672.992	"A great man, who always fought for the good of the others," he adds.
SNT.7672.993	The cousins got very sad when they heard that the Pope was gone.
SNT.7672.994	"To me, he seems to be a brother, more than my own brother ," said Isidoro.
SNT.7672.995	João said about the Pope: "I think he did the work what should be done."
SNT.7672.996	He added: "It is like to lose a father, I am very sad".
SNT.7672.997	According to Folha de São Paulo, Brazilian government invited João to take part in the funeral of the Pope.
SNT.7672.998	He declined saying that he is afraid of flying in airplanes.
SNT.85523.999	He said that $100 dollars per barrel was a "fair" price and remembered that when he assumed presidency of Venezuela in 1999, the price went up to about ten dollars.
SNT.85523.1000	The prices of raw oil approached $100 last week before settling down again.
SNT.85523.1001	Some observers think it is possible that the $100 barrier may be broken.
SNT.85523.1002	During the trading session following this two-day summit, that is expected to result in the "Declaration of Riyadh", the price of petroleum rose $0.80 in the New York market and $0.66 in London.
SNT.148896.1003	He succumbed to injuries suffered when a young police officer allegedly beat him into a coma earlier in the month while in a holding cell reserved for the drunk and disorderly.
SNT.148896.1004	The injuries included severe damage to many of his internal organs.
SNT.148896.1005	Authorities identified this little-known reporter who specialized in economics as Konstantin Popov.
SNT.148896.1006	Popov was one of the cofounders of a small regional newspaper publisher and a local magazine called Tema.
SNT.148896.1007	In a country where police brutality and corruption—especially against journalists—is not uncommon, the editor-in-chief of Tema, Konstantin Karpachyov, said it was unlikely Popov's murder was in any way related to his work.
SNT.148896.1008	However, Karpachyov went on to say that, "This could happen to absolutely anyone."
SNT.148896.1009	"The only thing different about this case is that he happened to be a journalist, so it became a high-profile public case."
SNT.148896.1010	"But the same thing happens every day," said Svetlana Gannushkina, of Russia's Civic Assistance committee.
SNT.148896.1011	"Usually the cases are just closed down because there's no evidence, nobody testifies, and it's impossible to get to the bottom of it."
SNT.148896.1012	Upon learning Popov's identity, numerous members of the state-controlled media strongly criticized the police for their passive response to the actions allegedly committed by one of their own.
SNT.148896.1013	Following which, news conferences were called, and before long Popov's case began to draw national attention.
SNT.148896.1014	This resulted in the holding cell where Popov's beating occurred being closed down.
SNT.148896.1015	In addition, the deputy police chief resigned as well as supervisor of the precinct in question.
SNT.148896.1016	The suspected officer, Alexei Mitayev, was dismissed from the force, arrested, and is said to have since confessed to this crime.
SNT.148896.1017	Mitayev cited that "stress due to family problems" is what led to his actions against Popov.
SNT.148896.1018	The chairman of the Tomsk branch of the Union of Journalists of Russia said that a source close to the investigation told him that Popov was not only beaten but was also "tortured" and "violated" with a foreign object.
SNT.148896.1019	"Hands off journalists!" the journalist union said in a statement on its website.
SNT.148896.1020	According to the United States-based Committee to Protect Journalists, as far as they know, "since 2000, at least seventeen Russian journalists have been killed due to their work, and the killers have been convicted in only one case."
SNT.148896.1021	President Dmitry Medvedev said that such police misconduct was not only angering the Russian public, but was also undermining the state's authority.
SNT.148896.1022	He called for comprehensive reform and ordered the Interior Ministry to cut its staff by one-fifth by 2012.
SNT.88632.1023	In the "2008 Taipei City New Year Countdown Party", several local and foreign media focused on the fireworks of the Taipei 101 due to the notability of the skyscraper world-wide.
SNT.88632.1024	After some criticism from government executives because some wordmarks by sponsors appeared on the Taipei 101, the Taipei Financial Center (owner of Taipei 101) decided to set up 12,000 sparklers 500 meters tall from the 34th floor to the top of the tower on the 101st floor.
SNT.88632.1025	Even though the ingredients of the sparklers were made in China, Vice President of Taipei 101 Michael Liu commented that the idea issues on quality of production and trends of industry.
SNT.88632.1026	According to TV channel TVBS, the light of "Love Taiwan" wordmarks accidentally appeared before the celebration while President of the Republic of China Shui-bian Chen addressed in the "2008 Dream More Kaohsiung" New Year Celebration in Kaohsiung City.
SNT.88632.1027	After the Taipei City Government became aware of this accident and remonstrated against current Chairman of Taipei 101 Diana Chen, the Taipei 101 re-lighted the wordmark after successfully celebrating New Year's.
SNT.88632.1028	Current Mayor of Taipei Lung-pin Hau regretted the incident and hoped the Executive Yuan could notify the government in the future of the incident.
SNT.88632.1029	The Minister of the Government Information Office Jhy-wey Hsieh complained in the City's Government of the sponsorships.
SNT.88632.1030	The 2008 Taipei City New Year Countdown Party was apparently "faded" with political factor.
SNT.109277.1031	At least eight construction workers have died and thirteen more are injured after a building collapsed during construction in Qiuzhigou Village, a suburb of China's Wuhan City.
SNT.109277.1032	It is unclear how many more if any are trapped as the project's coordinator fled and is being sought by police.
SNT.109277.1033	The collapse occurred at 5 p.m. local time yesterday and reduced the four-story structure to a five-metre pile of rubble.
SNT.109277.1034	The building was a private residence and was illegal as authorities had not been informed of it.
SNT.109277.1035	Its location in an area accessible only via narrow alleys is hampering search and rescue efforts as heavy equipment such as cranes is having difficulty reaching the scene.
SNT.109277.1036	Around 100 rescuers continue to pick through the rubble in the rain.
SNT.29845.1037	This is an excerpt translation of a text found on the German wikipedia site, with an update.
SNT.29845.1038	The roof over the local ice and tennis court crashed shortly after the end of the official skating time on 2 Jan 05, at about 16.50 hrs.
SNT.29845.1039	At the time, there were about 50 people inside, mostly families with children.
SNT.29845.1040	By 10 pm, five had been found dead, one child among them.
SNT.29845.1041	20 to 25 people have been injured, just as many are missing.
SNT.29845.1042	The reason for the cave-in of the roof was most likely massive snowfalls.
SNT.29845.1043	Earlier that afternoon, measurements had been taken to determine its stability.
SNT.29845.1044	Update on 4 January, 15:42 GMT: So far, 14 bodies have been found.
SNT.86574.1045	In an investigation reported on first by Wikinews, Wikileaks today revealed another chapter in the story of the Standard Operations Procedure (SOP) manual for the Camp Delta facility at Guantanamo Bay.
SNT.86574.1046	The latest documents they have received are the details of the 2004 copy of the manual signed off by Major General Geoffrey D. Miller of the U.S. Southern Command.
SNT.86574.1047	This is following on from the earlier leaking of the 2003 version.
SNT.86574.1048	Wikileaks passed this document to people they consider experts in the field to carry out an analysis trying to validate it.
SNT.86574.1049	Following this, they set out to assess what had changed between 2003 and 2004; including attempts to link publicly known incidents with changes to the manual.
SNT.86574.1050	The American Civil Liberties Union had previously made a request to view and obtain copies of the same document, but was denied access to them.
SNT.86574.1051	One of the first notable changes to the document relates to the detainees themselves.
SNT.86574.1052	Rules are now posted around the camp in detainees' languages.
SNT.86574.1053	Of concern to groups such as Amnesty International who campaign for the camp's closure, or Human Rights Watch concerned about prisoner handling under the prisoner of war aspects of the Geneva Convention, is the fact that policy for newly admitted detainees still allows for up to 4 weeks where access to the detainee by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) may be denied.
SNT.86574.1054	In addition, guards are not to allow ICRC staff to pass mail to detainees.
SNT.86574.1055	A new process has been formed which allows guards to determine whether or not a detainee receives awards, or is punished.
SNT.86574.1056	The form is called a GTMO Form 508-1 (pictured to the right).
SNT.86574.1057	According to the manual, the form "is used to determine which rewards the detainee will lose or gain," but "special rewards" can also be earned, outside of the process.
SNT.86574.1058	Another special reward is a roll of toilet paper, but the detainee cannot share it with others.
SNT.86574.1059	Doing so will result in "punishment" and confiscation of the roll.
SNT.86574.1060	If the detainee already has a roll of toilet paper, he is not allowed to have another.
SNT.86574.1061	"Guards need to ensure that the detainee doesn't receive additional toilet paper when the detainee already has it."
SNT.86574.1062	"The amount given to the detainee will be the same amount as normally distributed to the detainee," states the manual.
SNT.86574.1063	No matter how bad a detainee may act, "haircuts will never be used as punitive action" against them, but they can have hair removed for health reasons.
SNT.86574.1064	"If a detainee has committed an offense that requires segregation time, even if a segregation cell is not available, the detainee will receive a shave and a haircut for hygiene and medical reasons."
SNT.86574.1065	"If the detainee is IRFed, the haircut and shave will follow the decontamination process," adds the manual.
SNT.86574.1066	Infractions such as spitting, throwing water at, or attempting to urinate on guards appear as explicitly listed cases where pepper spray may not be used.
SNT.86574.1067	Extensive decontamination procedures are included in the document, including immediately calling for a medical check on any detainee exposed to pepper spray.
SNT.86574.1068	As a counter to the clearer instructions on use of pepper spray, Wikileaks asserts that many of the stricter rules for guards (referred to as Military Police or MPs in the 2003 manual) aim to reduce fraternisation that may improve detainee morale and adversely influence any interrogation process.
SNT.86574.1069	Guards are informed in the manual not to take personal mail and parcels within the detention blocks or at any other duty stations.
SNT.86574.1070	All electronic devices except issued materiel are prohibited, and guards may face disciplinary action should they keep detainees apprised of current affairs or discuss issues in their personal lives.
SNT.86574.1071	Additional restrictions on the detainees' chaplain are included in the revised document.
SNT.86574.1072	Wikileaks speculated that many of these changes might have stemmed from the widely publicised case of James Yee.
SNT.86574.1073	Captain Yee, a West Point graduate, served at the Guantanamo Bay base as a Muslim chaplain to the detainees and received two Distinguished Service medals for his work.
SNT.86574.1074	Following discovery of a list of detainees and interrogators by U.S. Customs in Florida Yee was charged with sedition, aiding the enemy, spying, espionage, and failure to obey a general order.
SNT.86574.1075	Eventually all charges were dropped with national security concerns being raised should evidence be released.
SNT.86574.1076	The most notable changes surrounding the role of the chaplain include its removal as a permanent position on the facility's Library Working group and its exclusion from the decision process on appropriate detainee reading material.
SNT.86574.1077	Wikileaks contacted lawyers representing detainees in the camp to perform their own analysis.
SNT.86574.1078	Their opinion of the changes were that the library operation had been considerably tightened up.
SNT.86574.1079	Duplicate books are required for the individual four camps to prevent covert use of books to communicate between camps.
SNT.86574.1080	Periodicals, dictionaries, language instruction books, technology or medical update information, and geography were additions to the prohibited material.
SNT.86574.1081	Instructions indicate such books must be returned to the source or donor.
SNT.86574.1082	The revised SOP manual makes considerable progress on documenting procedures, even those that are remote possibilities.
SNT.86574.1083	A lengthy addition details rules to follow in the event of an escape or escape attempt.
SNT.86574.1084	Laced throughout this procedure is an emphasis on having any such incident fully documented and - wherever possible - filmed.
SNT.86574.1085	The procedure is explicit in how to recapture an escaped detainee with minimal use of force.
SNT.86574.1086	One additional procedure covers the admission of ambulances to the main base area.
SNT.86574.1087	A detailed security protocol to ensure only expected and authorised traffic gains access is included, as is a procedure streamlined to ensure the ambulance arrives on the scene as quickly as possible.
SNT.86574.1088	Unchanged from the 2003 manual is the set menu of four ready-to-eat meals (Meal, Ready-to-Eat or MRE) issued to detainees.
SNT.86574.1089	However, additional steps are to be taken for "MRE Sanitization"; supply personnel must remove anything that can damage waste disposal systems— presumably a military term for toilets.
SNT.86574.1090	Under normal camp conditions, detainees should be fed hot meals as opposed to MREs, but no details on the variety of menu are included.
SNT.86574.1091	US Southern Command passed a query on to Rick Haupt (Commander, U.S. Navy Director of Public Affairs, Joint Task Force at Guantanamo) who responded that "questions were forwarded along with a request to authenticate the leaked document; a response is pending."
SNT.86574.1092	At this time no response to emails has been received from the ICRC or Human Rights Watch.
SNT.86574.1093	The Pentagon has requested that the document be removed from Wikileaks because "information with the FOUO (For Official Use Only) label is not approved for release to the public."
SNT.86574.1094	They then state that the document can be "made available through a Freedom Of Information Act request through official channels."
SNT.98436.1095	Two weeks ago, on February 1st, it was the second day of the national environmental Focus the Nation teach-in.
SNT.98436.1096	One of these events, which took place at the same time at other educational institutions across the country, took place in the city of Lynn at the campus of North Shore Community College.
SNT.98436.1097	Wikinews accredited reporter Patrick Mannion was there in attendance along with Congressman John F. Tierney of Massachusetts's 6th congressional district and Lynn's State Senator Thomas McGee.
SNT.98436.1098	One of Lynn's two representatives, Robert Fennell, also attended; the other representative Steven Walsh sent an aide.
SNT.98436.1099	The representatives for the nearby cities of Salem and Beverly, John Keenan and Mary Grant along with various local area mayors and city councilors also attended the event.
SNT.98436.1100	John F. Kerry, the senator for Massachusetts was supposed to attend but could not due to voting on the economic stimulus package in Washington D.C..
SNT.98436.1101	However, Senator Kerry did record a video statement DVD for the event in which he addressed the gathered crowd.
SNT.98436.1102	Senator McGee started things off by talking about the need to recreate the North Shore Technical High School to include a focus on environmental jobs and the need to improve the Essex Agricultural and Technical High School which is deteriorating, but is known for it's agricultural teaching which would help to save the dwindling farming areas north of Boston.
SNT.98436.1103	McGee urged people that should get more involved with their local farming co-ops and that farmland needs to be recognized and redeveloped.
SNT.98436.1104	He noted that obesity in young people is a problem and that schools are developing partnerships with local farms to provide more healthy meals and to show students whats going on at their local farm.
SNT.98436.1105	Representative Keenan commended the college for holding this dialogue and Al Gore along with his movie, An Inconvenient Truth.
SNT.98436.1106	Keenan noted the need for Salem's coal-fired power station for the need to switch to clean coal.
SNT.98436.1107	Walsh aide's brought up the fact he is committed to ending paper waste at the Massachusetts State House.
SNT.98436.1108	The city council president from Chelsea, Roseann Bongiovanni, who is also the associate executive director of the local community organization, the Chelsea Collaborative, asked the various reasons for the crowd in why they became concerned about global warming.
SNT.98436.1109	The audience noted the melting of ice sheets, air quality, Hurricane Katrina and Al Gore.
SNT.98436.1110	Bongiovanni then noted that Chelsea and neighboring East Boston have no green space or waterfront due the industrialization of both areas, noting that 100% of the jet fuel for planes at Logan Airport, 70% to 80% of heating oil and that the trucks delivering the oil are spewing diesel.
SNT.98436.1111	She also noted the large salt pile in Chelsea used for the deicing of highways in the Commonwealth and said that it is located there "illegally."
SNT.98436.1112	She further noted the company, Energy Management Inc., behind the controversial Cape Wind project, proposed building a diesel power plant across the street from a Chelsea elementary school and that air quality in Chelsea is bad.
SNT.98436.1113	She closed her dialogue by noting that "Global warming does not recognize boundaries."
SNT.98436.1114	Mary Grant said she was interested in hearing ideas and noted the redeveloping of Beverly's high school to include more solar panels and a new wind turbine and that the school would be powered by 50% of it.
SNT.98436.1115	One person asked the need to lower the level of bureaucracy in government as she was "running around city government" in order to have a bee farm in her backyard.
SNT.98436.1116	Robert Fenell, the owner of Lynn's Capitol Diner who is notable for keeping chickens at the establishment located in downtown Lynn just two blocks away from the college noted that people should start going organic and going back to nature, that people should switch to more energy efficient lighting and grow gardens in their backyard.
SNT.98436.1117	After Fennell spoke it was time for questions and answers, and questions were given by various audiences members including Mannion himself, who asked about the MBTA's Blue Line and rapid transit and others asking various questions such wither or not to include a green curriculum in state education or asking for the politicians to talk more on some of their positions.
SNT.98436.1118	After questions and answers finished, the video statement from John Kerry began to play.
SNT.98436.1119	Kerry noted that there are still skeptics of global warming and climate change in Congress who "test the science" despite the efforts and research of Al Gore and the United Nations and noting that "the White House is the last place for change."
SNT.98436.1120	He then went on to say that the world needed a new international treaty on climate change and noted that America is horrendous when it comes to energy efficiency.
SNT.98436.1121	Kerry also noted that the Bush administration resisted the change and the points of the climate conference in Bali; "Luckily, time is almost up," added Kerry.
SNT.98436.1122	Kerry went on to mention the need for massive new research on new energy and capturing carbon and noted he was working with Alaska's senator, Ted Stevens on pushing for sequestering plants.
SNT.98436.1123	Kerry continued the theme of environmental conservation and change by topping off his statement by reminding the crowd of first Earth Day and how it lead to the creation of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and the Environmental Protection Agency and it noted it happened because of people's actions.
SNT.98436.1124	Tierney finished off the speech by noting the need for high risk energy research in the style of DARPA so we can better compete against the "Chinas and Japans."
SNT.98436.1125	He also called for more green-collar jobs and noted his work on last year's Green Jobs Act.
SNT.123997.1126	The United Stated Department of Justice has asked for corruption charges against former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens to be dropped because evidence was withheld from the defense team by the original prosecutors.
SNT.123997.1127	The Justice Department has stated that they will not retry Stevens.
SNT.123997.1128	In a statement, US Attorney General Eric Holder said, "After careful review, I have concluded that certain information should have been provided to the defense for use at trial."
SNT.123997.1129	"In light of this conclusion, and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial."
SNT.123997.1130	Stevens was convicted in October on seven felony counts of lying on senate disclosure forms about gifts, largely in the form of free renovations to his home, received from an oil service company; his conviction is thought to have been a large factor in his November electoral defeat to former Anchorage mayor Mark Begich, the current junior Senator from Alaska.
SNT.123997.1131	Stevens immediately appealed his conviction and has maintained his innocence.
SNT.123997.1132	The prosecution case has met with a number of procedural difficulties, with US District Court judge Emmet G. Sullivan holding the prosecution in contempt in March for failing to turn over documents concerning an FBI whistleblower's reports of mishandling of the case.
SNT.123997.1133	The Justice Department has since replaced the case's prosecutors, and the allegations of misconduct have held up sentencing from the original convictions.
SNT.123997.1134	The filed papers indicate that notes were never turned over from an interview that has the oil contractor estimated the house renovation for far less then he specified at trial.
SNT.123997.1135	The original trial team was removed, but in the end Attorney General Eric Holder thought it would be best if the case was dropped.
SNT.123997.1136	NPR's source indicate that Holder wish to forcefully transmit that prosecutorial misconduct will not be tolerated.
SNT.123997.1137	The trying prosecutors are under investigation by the Justice Department for their conduct in the matter.
SNT.123997.1138	Stevens, now 85, served as Alaska's Senator from 1968 to 2009.
SNT.111137.1139	On Saturday Mikheil Saakashvili, the President of Georgia, called for a ceasefire in the South Ossetia war.
SNT.111137.1140	"I call for an immediate ceasefire," said Saakashvili, speaking in Tbilisi.
SNT.111137.1141	"Russia has launched a full scale military invasion of Georgia."
SNT.111137.1142	After calling for the ceasefire Saakashvili continued by saying that "I am willing to have international mediation; I am willing to have international separation of forces; we have to establish normal regime under international supervision."
SNT.111137.1143	Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated his position regarding the ending of the conflict in a phone call with Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel: "The only possible and reasonable way out of this situation is the withdrawal of Georgian troops to their initial positions and the immediate signing of a legally binding agreement on the non-use of force."
SNT.111137.1144	He reiterated much the same position in telephone conversation with the President of the United States, George W. Bush, today.
SNT.111137.1145	Saakashvili's call for a ceasefire comes soon after his declaration that Georgia is now in a state of war.
SNT.111137.1146	"I have signed a decree on a state of war."
SNT.111137.1147	"Georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the Russian navy, air force, large-scale ground operations," he said in a televised meeting that was broadcast on national television.
SNT.111137.1148	Alexandre Lomaia, the head of the Georgian security council, said that President Saakashvili's proposal states that the Georgian troops will withdraw from Tskhinvali, and will stop reacting to the Russian bombings.
SNT.111137.1149	The crisis broke out after days of heavy fighting in the region.
SNT.111137.1150	On August 7, Georgian troops launched an offensive against the Ossetian town of Tskhinvali.
SNT.111137.1151	Russia responded to these actions by sending their own troops into South Ossetia on August 8.
SNT.111137.1152	According to the Russian Presidents office, drinking water is no longer available in what constitutes South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali, because "the water and sewage treatment plants have been destroyed".
SNT.111137.1153	It is further stated that 30,000 people have left South Ossetia to seek refuge in Russia in the last 36 hours alone; and that preparations are underway to provide tented and permanent accommodation for these.
SNT.111137.1154	South Ossetia is a former province of Georgia that broke away from Georgia and declared its independence on November 28, 1991.
SNT.122440.1155	Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States have issued an 'urgent safety recommendation' in connection to their role alongside the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch in investigating loss of power in Rolls-Royce engines on Boeing 777s, with the AAIB following suit.
SNT.122440.1156	One of them resulted in British Airways Flight 38 crashing short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport last year.
SNT.122440.1157	The NTSB and the AAIB want Rolls-Royce to redesign the engines.
SNT.122440.1158	Both events occurred on Boeing 777-200ER airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800 Series engines.
SNT.122440.1159	On January 17, 2008 British Airways Flight 38 experienced a dual engine rollback (reduction of engine power) on final approach to Heathrow and crashed, leaving one passenger seriously injured, eight passengers and four of the flight crew with minor injuries and the airplane written off.
SNT.122440.1160	The second event occurred on November 26, 2008, when a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 experienced a single engine rollback during cruise flight over Montana, United States while en route from Shanghai to Atlanta.
SNT.122440.1161	Normal operations resumed after the flight crew followed Boeing's published procedure to recover engine performance and the airplane landed safely in Atlanta.
SNT.122440.1162	Boeing has already developed new procedures after the crash to prevent ice from building up within their 777 fuel systems after it became apparent that icing may have been a factor, and it was some of these that the Delta flight crew had followed.
SNT.122440.1163	As part of the recent releases by the NTSB and AAIB it has become apparent that investigators from both bodies, which are collaborating, have found ice buildup in the fuel system caused both rollbacks.
SNT.122440.1164	In both cases a build-up of ice (from water normally present in all jet fuel) developed on a component called the fuel/oil heat exchanger.
SNT.122440.1165	This restricted the flow of fuel to the engine, resulting in the uncommanded engine rollback.
SNT.122440.1166	Investigators initially struggled to produce enough ice under test conditions but have now found that at high concentration, fuel can form ice at very low temperatures in enough quantity to seriously restrict fuel flow, according to a new interim report by the AAIB.
SNT.122440.1167	This does not occur when fuel demand is lower, as the hot oil then becomes sufficient to entirely melt the ice.
SNT.122440.1168	The vigorous tests are thought to be the first of their kind.
SNT.122440.1169	They have also confirmed that while ice may have formed elsewhere in the airliner's fuel system fuel was probably not restricted at any other location.
SNT.122440.1170	Instead, it is thought 'soft' ice formed in the pipes and then broke off, travelling to the fuel/oil heat exchanger and restricting it.
SNT.122440.1171	The NTSB has now revealed that they have advised Rolls-Royce to redesign the fuel/oil heat exchanger, and Rolls-Royce have stated that they are indeed working on a replacement part that will be available within twelve months.
SNT.122440.1172	The AAIB advised Boeing and Rolls-Royce to jointly review the problem across the fuel system, and both companies responded that they 'accepted' this recommendation and repeated that a replacement part was being developed.
SNT.122440.1173	Both the NTSB and the AAIB also sent letters to the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency requesting the installment of the modified component be mandatory.
SNT.122440.1174	The NTSB suggested this should be either the next maintenance check or within six months.
SNT.122440.1175	There are 220 Boeing 777-200s - the only type using the affected engine - with Trent 800 series engines.
SNT.122440.1176	The fuel/oil heat exchanger is a dual purpose part designed to simultaneously melt fuel ice and cool down engine oil.
SNT.122440.1177	The AAIB further noted that it is unclear whether other aircraft designs are at risk, and advised the FAA and EASA to look into increased use of de-icing additives and investigate both the accumulation and sudden movement of ice in aircraft fuel systems and the actual formation of ice in the fuel itself.
SNT.27408.1178	A new advertising campaign in USA for the Sony PSP which looks like graffiti and is often sprayed on previously vandalized walls has come under attack from other graffiti artists.
SNT.27408.1179	A collective group of graffiti artists and street artists are now banding together, vandalizing the look-alike graffiti advertisements.
SNT.27408.1180	The campaign has offended a lot of graffiti artists and street artists, drawing responses like "keep your desperate corporate long arm out of a movement that is the only thing that is ours!"
SNT.27408.1181	But not all the responses have been negative, with many artists defending Sony saying they have the right.
SNT.27408.1182	"Sony and PSP have every right to use this type of media," Floyd Hayes, the head creative director at Cunning Work told Wired News.
SNT.27408.1183	"They have done it for (a) very long time very successfully and spoke the language of the streets without being patronizing."
SNT.27408.1184	Sony says it is paying the building owners like Casa Maria for the right to advertise on their walls.
SNT.27408.1185	Casa Maria was paid $100 for two weeks' use of its wall, co-owner Mario Arana told Wired News.
SNT.27408.1186	Tats Cru, the graffiti crew responsible for the designs, have also been targeted with insulting slogans on Sony's advertisements.
SNT.139522.1187	Six energy companies in the United Kingdom have announced that it is likely that the prices for energy bills could increase over the course of 2010.
SNT.139522.1188	The companies, which are nicknamed the "big six" in the United Kingdom, did not pass on information that there would be price cuts in energy bills despite increasing profits.
SNT.139522.1189	However, the companies have in fact sent a message in response saying that the prices of bills may even increase over the course of the next year.
SNT.139522.1190	Energy company watchdog the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) have estimated that energy companies will make gross margins of ￡170 ($276) per dual fuel customer over the course of the next twelve months, due to the recent fall in wholesale energy costs.
SNT.139522.1191	Ofgem have said: "Our analysis shows that based on an 18-month hedging strategy and assuming that retail prices remain unchanged, projected gross margin is set to increase by around ￡80 for dual fuel customers over the next six months."
SNT.139522.1192	The "big six" energy companies in the United Kingdom are British Gas, E-on, Npower, Scottish and Southern Energy, Scottish Power, and EDF Energy.
SNT.139522.1193	British Gas stated: "Prices [are] likely to remain at historically high levels, and in fact likely to increase as non-commodity costs rise ever upwards."
SNT.139522.1194	EDF Energy said: "[We] would of course be prepared to reduce tariffs if market conditions allowed."
SNT.139522.1195	Scottish Power stated: "There are no immediate signals that would indicate a fall in retail prices for this winter, and risks of an increase next year."
SNT.139522.1196	Scottish & Southern Energy commented: "With forward annual wholesale prices significantly higher, and with upward pressures in terms of distribution, environmental and social costs, seeking to avoid an increase between now and the end of 2010 is an important goal."
SNT.139522.1197	Meanwhile, a study by Consumer Focus in early September 2009 suggested that "energy companies were overcharging customers by ￡100 ($162) every year."
SNT.139522.1198	A spokesperson for Ofgem said that there was no evidence of any cartel in operation, or evidence of profiteering.
SNT.139522.1199	The spokesperson commented: "It is up to the companies themselves to decide whether to cut their bills."
SNT.139522.1200	"Consumer Focus data suggests that Scottish Power has increased dual fuel prices by the most since 2003 - up 148% - while decreasing prices by 0.6% so far this year."
SNT.139522.1201	"RWE's Npower has increased tariffs by 132% since 2003, but has reduced bills by 2.7% in 2009."
SNT.10709.1202	The University of California, Berkeley announced that one of its graduate students, Michael Park, rediscovered on May 24 the Mount Diablo buckwheat, a plant not sighted since 1936 and believed to have been extinct.
SNT.10709.1203	Found nearly 30 miles east of San Francisco, Park [aged 35] identified the small pink flowering plant said to resemble baby's breath during a routine visit to the mountain.
SNT.10709.1204	The significance of the find drew comparisons to the recent discovery of the Ivory-billed woodpecker in Arkansas earlier this year in April.
SNT.10709.1205	The exact location of the flowering plant is, for now, being kept secret.
SNT.10709.1206	Several botanists have confirmed it along with the nearly dozen or so other plants.
SNT.10709.1207	The property is being preserved by the Save Mount Diablo conservation group operating in the Mount Diablo State Park.
SNT.278552.1208	The United Nations (UN) on Friday called on the government of Pakistan to investigate numerous killings and abductions, particularly of journalists.
SNT.278552.1209	"In the past eight days alone we have received reports on the killing of one journalist, Munir Shakir, in Balochistan on August 14 2011, and the disappearance of another journalist, Rehmatullah Daparkhel, three days earlier in North Waziristan on August 11," said spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville.
SNT.278552.1210	According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, nine journalists have been killed in Pakistan this year, and at least 16 were killed in 2010.
SNT.278552.1211	None of the killings had been investigated satisfactorily, Colville said.
SNT.278552.1212	Colville said that the UN would like to see the government review all of the incidents.
SNT.278552.1213	"We call on all responsible parties to immediately stop such violations of human rights, and we urge the government to take immediate steps to independently investigate these cases," he said.
SNT.278552.1214	Amnesty International has also urged the government of Pakistan to ensure the protection of journalists and media workers in the country.
SNT.278552.1215	They have further called upon the Pakistani authorities to investigate attacks on journalists and to try those responsible in line with internationally recognised standards of human rights.
SNT.278552.1216	Colville said that the recent attacks on journalists were not uncommon in Pakistan and that many journalist groups regard the country as one of the most dangerous places to work.
SNT.278552.1217	Shakir was shot dead after covering a protest organized by a Baloch separatist organization.
SNT.278552.1218	Irshad Matsoi, the bureau chief for the Online News Network where Shakir worked, said that the killing was linked to the journalist’s work.
SNT.278552.1219	Journalism in Balochistan is becoming "an endangered profession," Matsoi said.
SNT.278552.1220	Reporters Without Borders (RWB) have appealed for punishment of those responsible for the murder.
SNT.278552.1221	According to RWB, journalists do not feel free to report in Balochistan, which has led to self-censorship in the region.
SNT.278552.1222	The whereabouts of Daparkhel, kidnapped on August 11, is still unknown.
SNT.278552.1223	The worldwide press freedom organization said that the government must do everything they can to find him immediately.
SNT.278552.1224	"It is unacceptable that local journalists have to do the job of the police and investigate on their own using their contacts," the organization said.
SNT.278552.1225	The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has condemned the incidents.
SNT.278552.1226	"There is a growing sense of insecurity among media persons who increasingly interpret each attack on journalists as a warning to ‘behave,’" the HRCP said last Monday.
SNT.278552.1227	The HRCP also said that in almost all cases of violence against journalists in the last few years, those responsible have not been identified or punished.
SNT.278552.1228	"The HRCP calls upon the government to respond through effective action and not mere words in the next few days, sending a strong message to the mischief makers that it would no longer stand by as a mere spectator as journalists are killed and snatched," the Commission said.
SNT.16726.1229	Mohammed Bouyeri, a radical Islamist who was a member of the Hofstad Network, was sentenced to life in prison by a court in Amsterdam for the killing of the controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh in November 2004.
SNT.16726.1230	Van Gogh was ambushed on an Amsterdam street and shot repeatedly in the chest before Bouyeri stabbed him and slit his throat.
SNT.16726.1231	The judgment said that Bouyeri showed "complete disregard for human life" and butchered Van Gogh "mercilessly".
SNT.16726.1232	Bouyeri, a 27 year who holds joint Dutch-Moroccan citizenship, claimed he acted on behalf of Islam.
SNT.16726.1233	He made a confession in the courtroom and vowed he would "do it again" if he had the chance.
SNT.16726.1234	Van Gogh had been a staunch critic of Islam and its perceived mistreatment of women.
SNT.16726.1235	Van Gogh directed several movies critical of Islam, most notably Submission in which verses of the Qur'an were written on naked women's bodies.
SNT.119265.1236	Severe flooding in the island nation of Fiji has killed eight people and forced thousands to evacuate.
SNT.119265.1237	The flooding is mainly in the western part of the country's main island, Viti Levu, where most of the resorts hosting international travellers are located.
SNT.119265.1238	Fiji's National Disaster Office has advised all tourists still in the country to prepare for more bad weather and possibly more flooding.
SNT.119265.1239	Fiji's chief of disaster management Aisea Qumihajelo said in a statement, "There's another depression heading toward Fiji within the next two days and that will bring an additional threat."
SNT.119265.1240	The government of Fiji's military dictator Frank Bainimarama declared a state of emergency in the city of Nadi, the country's tourist centre, and other parts of western Viti Levu.
SNT.119265.1241	Over 6,000 people have evacuated the area and are now in one of Fiji's 144 evacuation centers sheltered from the storm.
SNT.119265.1242	Government sources have reported that at least six people have been killed by floodwaters, and two people were crushed by a landslide.
SNT.119265.1243	The flood has affected many of the rural areas of the island, washing out sugar cane crops across the area and damaging roads and bridges.
SNT.119265.1244	"Widespread flooding, including severe flooding of major rivers and streams, is expected on Wednesday and Thursday."
SNT.119265.1245	"The western division is likely to be worse affected once again," said Fiji's director of meteorology, Rajendra Prasad.
SNT.119265.1246	Rescue efforts, led by the government and the Red Cross, have begun especially in rural and heavily-flooded areas.
SNT.119265.1247	Vetaia Dokonivalu, a local resident from Ba, a hard-hit town, commented, "It was really frightening."
SNT.119265.1248	"We watched as the doors of our homes were forced open by the water."
SNT.119265.1249	"We saw our belongings being swept out of the houses."
SNT.119265.1250	This flooding has also caused a food crisis in some parts.
SNT.119265.1251	Isimeli Tukana, a health official, said, "People need to collect as much rainwater as possible and drink as much of this as possible."
SNT.119265.1252	"Watch out for food from supermarkets especially from the towns of Ba, Nadi, Sigatoka and Rakiraki."
SNT.119265.1253	"Our health inspectors will be doing their rounds as soon as the water goes down."
SNT.119265.1254	According to the Fiji Retailers Association, the storm has caused over a million dollars worth of damage to Fiji's businesses.
SNT.4846.1255	A 6.5 magnitude earthquake has hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
SNT.4846.1256	The tremor, lasting about 2 minutes, sparked panic in numerous seaside communities on the island.
SNT.4846.1257	According to officials, no injuries have been reported but sea water levels have risen up to four meters in areas.
SNT.4846.1258	Though precise details of the earthquake are still unclear, the US Geological Survey has said the tremor just after 0800 local time (0000 UTC) was 10km (6 mi) beneath the sea bed.
SNT.4846.1259	Local meteorological officials have reported to the Associated Press news agency the earthquake had been 37km (23 mi) under the Sea of Flores.
SNT.22222.1260	At 07:00 UTC today (19:00 NZST, local time), the polls closed in the New Zealand general election, 2005.
SNT.22222.1261	Turnout was strong, turnout results are predicted to be to be higher than the 2002 turnout (77%)

SNT.99167.1265	The three armed robbers entered the museum half an hour before closing.
SNT.99167.1266	One man with a pistol forced employees to the ground while the other two men stole the paintings.
SNT.99167.1267	The four paintings are worth a total of 163 million US dollars.
SNT.99167.1268	It's said that it would be hard to sell the stolen paintings on the open market due to the popularity of the paintings.
SNT.99167.1269	There is a reward of 90 thousand US dollars for the artwork.
SNT.99167.1270	The robbers, who were still at large, stole the paintings Sunday from the E.G. Bührle Collection, one of Europe's finest private museums for Impressionist and ｖ, police said.
SNT.99167.1272	It was the largest art robbery in Swiss history and one of the biggest ever in Europe, said Marco Cortesi, spokesman for the Zurich police.
SNT.99167.1273	He compared it to the theft in 2004 of Edvard Munch's The Scream and Madonna from the Munch Museum in Norway.
SNT.99167.1274	Last week, Swiss police reported that two Pablo Picasso paintings were stolen from a Swiss exhibition near Zurich.
SNT.77778.1275	Fires continue to burn in Greece on Monday destroying everything in their path.

SNT.96153.1362	Luong and his wife, Kieu Ngoc Phan, reported the children missing on Monday.
SNT.96153.1363	When questioned, Luong claimed responsibility for the act, saying that he threw the children into the river after an argument with his wife.
SNT.96153.1364	However, he later retracted his confession, instead claiming that two women, one of whom is named "Kim", took the children and drove off in a van.

SNT.22802.1393	The campaign was especially harsh, most governmental parties calling for acceptance, except the far-right wing Swiss People's Party (though Swiss People's Party's charismatic figure Christoph Blocher personally called for acceptance as well).
SNT.22802.1394	Smaller formations, both from the extreme Right and extreme Left, attempted to smear fear of massive immigration and unemployement.
SNT.22802.1395	Switzerland has ratified bilateral agreements with the members of the European Union in March 2004, but the new members (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) were not included in the deal.

SNT.73440.1404	Coming up to the final leg of the race, Team New Zealand managed to take a 70 metre lead after the wind faded, and both yachts had dropped their spinnakers and Alinghi dropped into a hole.
SNT.73440.1405	Team New Zealand still had to complete their 360 degree penalty turn, and did so.

SNT.73440.1411	"They kept it close when we got past them on the first run they just kept on sailing the way they do and beat us fair and square in the end."
SNT.73440.1412	The New Zealand Government has announced that it is setting aside NZ$10 million to help retain key yachties.

SNT.73440.1414	Sports and recreation minister for New Zealand, Trevor Mallard, said, "It is the view of the government that the team should continue, that it should be based in New Zealand and that Auckland should host an America's Cup regatta again."
SNT.119974.1415	Martin Garbus, Esq. filed a shareholder derivative suit Monday against Marvel Entertainment and its Chief Executive Officer Isaac Perlmutter, as well as Stan Lee, the creator of Marvel superhero characters, and Lee's wife and former Marvel Studios head, Avi Arad.
SNT.119974.1416	The suit is for more than US$750 million (£528M) — about half of the estimated proceeds from Marvel's movies.
SNT.119974.1417	Plaintiff Stan Lee Media (SLM) has four shareholders who live in Florida, California and Canada, and include Jose Abadin and Nelson Thall.
SNT.119974.1418	The company is suing for recovery of civil damages representing one-half of film and book earnings from such blockbuster films as Spider-Man, Iron Man, X-Men, Hulk, and Fantastic Four franchises.
SNT.119974.1419	Defendants are accused of copyright violations over both the Marvel superhero characters and intellectual properties created by Stan Lee.
SNT.119974.1420	Spider-Man's three cinematic outings, starring Tobey Maguire, earned more than $1bn (￡702m).
SNT.119974.1421	"Most of Marvel's financial success, including from the films, comes out of assets created by Stan Lee that are the subject of this suit," the complaint states.
SNT.119974.1422	Lee, 86, has denied the allegations and has previously filed his own $50 million counter lawsuit against SLM, claiming the company has destroyed his name and reputation and prevented his effort to develop such properties as "The Accuser" and "The Drifter" and others via his first-look deals with Disney and Virgin Comics.
SNT.119974.1423	Former dot-com company STM further alleges that it has agreed to pay Lee a $250,000 annual salary plus $100 million in company stock in exchange for the rights to the superhero characters.
SNT.119974.1424	"That money should have gone to the corporation," said Garbus.
SNT.119974.1425	Lee's counsel, Mark Williams, replied: "We look forward to a positive resolution for Stan Lee and his family."
SNT.119974.1426	Marvel has said the court pleadings, which were filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, are filled with "ridiculous claims".
SNT.119974.1427	SLM ran out of operating capital during the dot-com meltdown in December 2000, closing operations entirely by December 19 of that year.
SNT.119974.1428	The company was placed into Chapter 11 Reorganization in Bankruptcy by Stan Lee in 2001.
SNT.119974.1429	During the insolvency proceedings, Lee assigned the major character franchises he had created to his new public company, POW! Entertainment, without the bankruptcy court's approval.
SNT.119974.1430	Two multi-billion dollar lawsuits for damages were filed against Lee, his new company, his new partner Arthur Lieberman and Marvel Entertainment for cybersquatting and failure to disclose the existence and value of the Rights Assignment Lee made to the company when he founded it.
SNT.119974.1431	The company remained under bankruptcy protection until the US Trustee for the Central District of California moved to dismiss the bankruptcy proceedings for failure of the company as debtor in possession to comply with basic requirements of filing monthly reports and paying quarterly fees to the Trustee.
SNT.119974.1432	SLM was taken back by the shareholders after its dismissal from bankruptcy and hired a legal and accounting forensic consultant to review all transactions that occurred during bankruptcy.
SNT.119974.1433	By November 2006, all of the officers and directors of the company had resigned or abandoned their positions and the company's lawyers for the debtors in possession attempted to obtain court authorization to destroy or dispose of the company's books and records.
SNT.119974.1434	This initiated a long-running legal battle between shareholders and the company's founder, Lee.
SNT.119974.1435	The plaintiffs in this most recent suit contend that Lee, Perlmutter, Arthur Lieberman and Avi Arad conspired in bad faith to conceal and misappropriate financial interests in Lee's creations assigned to Stan Lee Media in 1998.
SNT.119974.1436	SLM's meltdown involved its former President Peter F. Paul fleeing to Brazil, contributions made to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Paul's extradition and more.
SNT.119974.1437	In 2007, SLM filed a $5 billion lawsuit in which it claimed co-ownership of all of Stan Lee's creations for Marvel.

SNT.37837.1442	On Sunday, Iran tested its second underwater missile, the Fajr-3.
SNT.37837.1443	"The missile carries a very powerful warhead that enables it to operate against groups of warships and big submarines."
SNT.37837.1444	"Even if an enemy's warship sonar can detect the missile, no warship can escape from this missile because of its high speed," said General Ali Fadavi of the Revolutionary Guards.
SNT.37837.1445	He said the missile can travel at 328 feet a second.
SNT.37837.1446	If Iran's claims are correct, it would make this missile the fastest underwater missile in the world.
SNT.37837.1447	The second fastest missile would be the Russian's VA-111 Shkval, which was developed in 1995.
SNT.37837.1448	Iran successfully tested its first missile on March 31, 2006, and claims that it can "evade radar and it can evade anti-missile missiles," said Hossein Salami, head of the Revolutionary Guards Air Force.
SNT.37837.1449	"This technology is completely new, without copying any other missile systems that may exist in other countries" and also says it can carry several warheads.

SNT.127172.1457	The Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services is considering prosecuting and banning some Scientology practices, in particular the use of the Scientology personality test to sell courses.
SNT.127172.1458	State Secretary Rigmor Aasrud said that the activities in question might be prosecuted as fraud or as violations of existing healthcare regulations.
SNT.127172.1459	A Norwegian Member of Parliament (MP) whose daughter killed herself after taking such a test, supports the idea of prosecuting illegal practices rather than trying to ban the movement as a whole.
SNT.127172.1460	The statement was made after three journalists from the online edition of the newspaper Verdens Gang (VG) took the test.
SNT.127172.1461	The journalists wore hidden recording devices, and did not disclose that they were journalists; VG put the recordings on its website.
SNT.127172.1462	Scientology staff members told all three that they should buy a course to handle psychological issues.
SNT.127172.1463	Two of the journalists filled out the 200 questions with honest answers, while the third gave answers consistent with being depressed.
SNT.127172.1464	The "depressed" journalist was told that he should avoid traditional medicine, while one of the "normal" journalists was told that the course was her only hope for improvement unless she wanted to start taking "chemicals".
SNT.127172.1465	Matthias Fosse, spokesperson for the Church of Scientology in Norway, said that the staff members in question were acting individually.
SNT.127172.1466	He said that the Church of Scientology does not give medical advice, but that it encourages people to focus on the side effects of medications, and is critical of the "over-medication" of psychiatric patients.
SNT.127172.1467	Olav Gunnar Ballo, a Norwegian MP and medical doctor whose daughter Kaja suddenly killed herself after a negative experience with the Scientology test in France in March 2008, released a book about Kaja Ballo's life in April 2009.
SNT.127172.1468	The book debuted on 2nd place in the Norwegian best seller list.
SNT.127172.1469	Ballo listened to the recorded test result sessions from VG and said that he found the practice "horrible and harmful".
SNT.127172.1470	He told the newspaper Dagbladet that Norway could have something to learn from the current French prosecution of Scientology corporations and individuals, by prosecuting specific harmful practices rather than banning Scientology as a whole.
SNT.127172.1471	Matthias Fosse said that France is a far more secular society than Norway, and that France were going too far in their prosecution.
SNT.127172.1472	He said that France has a list of 165 organizations considered to be "sects", which not just included Scientology but also covered Baptists such as former U.S. president Bill Clinton.
SNT.127172.1473	The list which Fosse referred to is a list from the 1995 Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France.
SNT.127172.1474	Fosse said that the OSCE, the U.S. State Department and the UN had criticised French "violations of human rights".

SNT.721402.1517	The song has become the third most downloaded single of the week, following the death of former United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

SNT.721402.1519	Controller of Radio 1 Ben Cooper said "about a four or five second clip" of the song would be included in a news item explaining why it has featured in the charts, which will air as part of the programme.

SNT.104428.1553	"In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them," Clinton said.
SNT.104428.1554	"That's a terrible thing to say but those people who run Iran need to understand that because that perhaps will deter them from doing something that would be reckless, foolish and tragic."
SNT.104428.1555	"One of the things that we've seen over the last several years is a bunch of talk using words like 'obliterate,'" Barack Obama said in a separate ABC interview.

SNT.123299.1595	Washington, D.C. - The Environmental Protection Agency may have a new tool in its arsenal to fight global warming.
SNT.123299.1596	The agency has submitted a proposal to the Obama administration which aims to list carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses as pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
SNT.123299.1597	The policy had previously been proposed to and rejected by the Bush administration, which said it was the wrong tool to be using.
SNT.123299.1598	The proposal lists the negative effects of global warming, including longer and hotter heat waves, increased flooding, and the increased spread of diseases due to warmer weather.
SNT.123299.1599	EPA administrator Lisa Jackson has previously suggested declaring global warming a health threat, and that the agency could use the 1970 Clean Air Act to use to combat it.
SNT.123299.1600	Environmental groups applauded the finding, with the director of Clean Air Watch, Frank O'Donnell, calling it "a green-letter day for the environment."
SNT.123299.1601	One of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice presidents, William L. Kovacs, said if the the proposal is put into effect that it "will be devastating to the economy."
SNT.123299.1602	It is unclear whether the Obama administration will go along with the proposal.

SNT.123299.1605	An upcoming conference in Copenhagen, Denmark will focus on drawing up a new international global warming treaty, which the United States plans to attend, a clear reversal from the Bush administration's non-participation in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

SNT.255058.1611	However, by making the designs of its servers open source, the company hopes others will find ways to improve them.
SNT.255058.1612	They can then incorporate those advances into their own servers.
SNT.255058.1613	Anything that can make Facebook's servers run more efficiently provides a major benefit for the company.
SNT.255058.1614	More efficient servers will also drive down utility costs for the social media giant, which relies on massive data centers around the United States to keep its operations going.
SNT.255058.1615	Facebook says it is already working with manufacturers, including Dell, that are manufacturing servers based on its designs.

SNT.456424.1634	"I thought this was going to be one of the greatest races in history, and I wanted the opportunity to be part of it."
SNT.456424.1635	Dullahan raced in this year's Kentucky Derby and took third place.

SNT.456424.1639	The dry spell will continue at least another year — the 34th year without a Triple Crown victory.
SNT.108616.1640	In a 5-4 vote, the United States Supreme Court overturned the death penalty for Patrick Kennedy, convicted of raping a child, saying it is not proportional to the crime and that it violates the Constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and thereby setting a precedent.
SNT.108616.1641	In the case Kennedy v. Louisiana, Patrick Kennedy of New Orleans, Louisiana was convicted of raping his eight-year old stepdaughter, and was sentenced to death for the crime.
SNT.108616.1642	A Louisiana law adopted in 1995 allowed the death penalty for those who had raped a child under 12 years old (later amended to 13).
SNT.108616.1643	Five other states have similar laws, while the remaining states ban the death penalty for rape.
SNT.108616.1644	The last execution for rape in America occurred in 1964.
SNT.108616.1645	The Louisiana Supreme Court defended Kennedy's sentence, saying that "short of first-degree murder, we can think of no other non-homicide crime more deserving" of the death penalty.
SNT.108616.1646	Kennedy, who was one of two criminals on death row in America who did not commit murder, challenged the court's decision, and the case was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court.
SNT.108616.1647	Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the Constitution did not allow the death penalty where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in a person's death.
SNT.108616.1648	He noted exceptions in cases of crimes against the state, such as treason and espionage.
SNT.108616.1649	Despite "the years of long anguish that must be endured by the victim of child rape," Justice Kennedy wrote, "the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."
SNT.108616.1650	He added, "When the law punishes by death, it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint."
SNT.108616.1651	The four liberal-leaning justices (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer) joined Kennedy, a moderate who often casts the deciding vote in close cases.
SNT.108616.1652	The four conservative-leaning justices (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito) dissented.
SNT.108616.1653	Samuel Alito wrote in his dissent, "The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave..."
SNT.108616.1654	"It is the judgment of the Louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other states that these harms justify the death penalty."
SNT.108616.1655	Alito said the decision would bar the death penalty "no matter how young the child, no matter how many times the child is raped, no matter how many children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how much physical or psychological trauma is inflicted, and no matter how heinous the perpetrator's prior criminal record may be."
SNT.108616.1656	"One thing is clear: The five members of the court who issued the opinion do not share the same 'standards of decency' as the people of Louisiana," Jindal said.
SNT.12989.1657	The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Internet file sharing networks can be sued for copyright infringement.
SNT.12989.1658	The court ruled that businesses created with the purpose of letting users commit copyright violations should be held liable for the infringement.
SNT.12989.1659	Writing for the court, Justice David Souter wrote: "One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the device's lawful uses."
SNT.12989.1660	The strength of the decision was unexpected — this is the first major Internet copyright case to reach the Supreme Court in many years, and the Justices' unanimity sends a strong message about their lack of tolerance for companies designed to violate the law.
SNT.12989.1661	The decision affects such companies as Grokster and StreamCast, both of which were defendants in this suit.
SNT.12989.1662	The court's ruling does not have an immediate effect, however, as the Justices referred the decisions to a lower court to be reconsidered.
SNT.12989.1663	Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney for the EFF, panned the court for not providing a clear test for what constitutes inducement, saying it would discourage innovators unsure of their project's legality.
SNT.12989.1664	He did however remain optimistic about Grokster and StreamCast's chances in the lower courts.
SNT.103393.1665	An internet forum, run by the non-profit Epilepsy Foundation, was attacked last week by a group of vandals.
SNT.103393.1666	The attack, first reported by Wired News, exploited a function of the forums to post JavaScript code.
SNT.103393.1667	The code injected by the vandals flashed two images repeatedly and tried to lead users off to external websites showing flashing lights and shapes intended to trigger off epileptic fits.
SNT.103393.1668	The Epilepsy Foundation had to shut down the forum, and took some measures to prevent future attacks.
SNT.103393.1669	In a press release, the Foundation stated that several users of the forum, sufferers of epilepsy, experienced harsh migraines and seizures as a result of the attack.
SNT.103393.1670	One woman, RyAnne Fultz, was paralyzed by the flashing images in what she calls her worst attack in over a year, until her 11-year old son managed to get her to stop looking at the screen and close the flashing images.
SNT.103393.1671	They also posted a message regarding new measures saying "In our upping of security on the forums, we have established the following new rules: No animated images are allowed to be used anywhere from now on."
SNT.103393.1672	"No rich text is allowed in the body of messages at all, either."
SNT.103393.1673	Wired News additionally reports that there is "circumstantial evidence" linking the perpetrators of the attack to the internet group "Anonymous", who are most well known for their recent protests and attacks against the Church of Scientology, and their members created a reputation as "griefers" in the virtual worlds Second Life, and Habbo Hotel.
SNT.103393.1674	The Austrian paper Krone reports that the "usual goal of their attacks is to raise a fuss or disturb others".
SNT.103393.1675	Following critical reports about the attack, members of the group blamed the attack on the Church of Scientology.
SNT.103393.1676	Wired News states that the attack on the forum may have been the first computer attack in history to inflict physical harm on its victims.
SNT.103393.1677	Between three and five per cent of all epilepsy sufferers are vulnerable to seizures triggered by flashing lights, shapes or colours, like ones used in the attack.
SNT.103393.1678	Photosensitive epilepsy has been in the news increasingly over the last few years as various media have triggered seizures in people.
SNT.103393.1679	Recently a logo animation for the 2012 London Olympics caused thousands of people to experience seizures.
SNT.103393.1680	In another incident, the episode "Dennō Senshi Porygon" of the animated TV series Pokémon caused thousands of children to experience seizures in Japan.
SNT.103393.1681	In March, MTV refused to air a new video by Gnarls Barkley out of fear it would trigger seizures.
SNT.10736.1682	Irish low fares airline, Ryanair, this week celebrated its 20th birthday.
SNT.10736.1683	Having reached the milestone, the airline promptly used the opportunity, as always, to sell seats; launching a massive 200,000 seat sale at 99p/99c a seat.
SNT.10736.1684	The airline was founded in 1985 by the Irish businessman, Dr Tony Ryan.
SNT.10736.1685	It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between Waterford and London Gatwick with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by British Airways and Aer Lingus.
SNT.10736.1686	Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.
SNT.10736.1687	The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year.
SNT.10736.1688	Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years.
SNT.10736.1689	The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press "The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe."
SNT.10736.1690	To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from ￡99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%.
SNT.223800.1691	Australian airline Qantas has returned the first of its fleet of Airbus A380s to service, after all six of the "superjumbo" aircraft were grounded three weeks ago following one aircraft's engine sustaining extensive midair damage; it landed safely in Singapore without injury.
SNT.223800.1692	The airline stated that all of the aircraft have undergone extensive safety inspections and they are satisfied they are safe.
SNT.223800.1693	Alan Joyce, CEO of Qantas, said: "It's great that we can reintroduce the aircraft."
SNT.223800.1694	"If we weren't, we wouldn't be restarting the operations today."
SNT.223800.1695	A spokesperson confirmed that tests had been performed "in close consultation with Rolls-Royce and Airbus" on the model's Trent 900 engines.
SNT.223800.1696	Qantas has replaced at least 14 engines, and modifications have been made to Trent 900s used by two other companies, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.
SNT.223800.1697	Experts said that the incident was embarrassing for Airbus; the airline's shares have dropped by 7% since.
SNT.223800.1698	Aviation journalist Tom Ballantyne said that the failure earlier this month was "certainly the most serious incident that the A380 has experienced since it entered operations."
SNT.223800.1699	The A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007, and is now in service with several other airlines, including Air France.
SNT.223800.1700	It is the largest commercial passenger airliner in the world, with an 840-passenger maximum capacity, though Qantas's can carry 450.
SNT.223800.1701	There are reportedly plans to build a cargo version of the plane, which, aviation experts have suggested, would be the world's first "triple-decker" freight aircraft; Airbus has not confirmed that this variant will be built.
SNT.15006.1702	The U.S. space agency NASA called off the launch of Space shuttle Discovery today after a problem with a fuel sensor in the external tank used to detect fuel exhaustion.
SNT.15006.1703	According to the agency-run NASA TV, the low-fuel sensor was either malfunctioning or damaged.
SNT.15006.1704	The launch was already facing the threat of a scrub due to thunderstorms in the area.
SNT.15006.1705	The sensor is one of four used to trigger the engine cutout after launch.
SNT.15006.1706	Although only two are required for normal operation, and the Shuttle can be flown with one, NASA elected to maintain full redundancy.
SNT.15006.1707	Should more of the sensors fail, the engine might burn out due to lack of fuel, a situation that has not been tested.
SNT.15006.1708	The problem was detected during a simulation of an empty tank.
SNT.15006.1709	When placed in a mode simulating an empty tank, three of the sensors correctly registered that the tank was empty, while the faulty sensor stayed in the "full" state.
SNT.15006.1710	NASA is currently unsure whether the problem relates to the sensor, the instrumentation circuits reporting the sensor's state, or the simulation circuits.
SNT.15006.1711	The problem comes after a separate incident yesterday when a cockpit window cover fell from the Orbiter, damaging thermal protection tiles.
SNT.15006.1712	A similar problem caused the replacement of the fuel tank in June.
SNT.15006.1713	The launch, which was scheduled for 3:51 ET (20:51 UTC), would have been the first launch of a shuttle since Columbia's February 2003 crash which killed all crew members aboard.
SNT.15006.1714	It is still unknown to NASA officials what caused the sensor to become defective.
SNT.15006.1715	It is also unknown at the moment whether the issue will be fixed on the launch pad, or in the Vehicle Assembly Building - in which it takes close to a full day's time to transport a shuttle between the two areas.
SNT.15006.1716	In the interim, the crew of the shuttle will stay at KSC unless there are further delays, in which case the crew might be transported back to JSC in Houston for refresher training.
SNT.147700.1717	The president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, has distanced himself from a controversial bill in the Parliament that would make certain acts of homosexuality punishable by death.
SNT.147700.1718	Until President Museveni publicly spoke out, this proposal was widely supported by the ruling majority party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), and, as a result, was expected to easily pass with a significant number of votes in its favor.
SNT.147700.1719	In a nation where homosexuality is already a criminal offense punishable by up to fourteen years in jail, this bill would raise that penalty to life in prison.
SNT.147700.1720	It would also dole out the death penalty for any offense categorized as "aggravated homosexuality"—meaning a case in which one of the participants is either a minor, HIV-positive, or a "serial offender."
SNT.147700.1721	Museveni stressed in this statement on Wednesday, that the Member of Parliament who drafted the legislation in question, although he is a member of the NRM, was not following government policy and did so solely as an individual.
SNT.147700.1722	Museveni, who admitted being at the center of widespread international criticism, said in the same statement that this matter was now a "foreign policy issue," and therefore his government, Parliament included, "must take into account [Uganda's] foreign policy interests."
SNT.147700.1723	Case in point, Sweden has since threatened to cut financial support to the small African nation if this bill does in fact go through.
SNT.147700.1724	In addition, numerous other world powers over the past weeks have contacted Museveni directly to elaborate upon their objections.
SNT.147700.1725	Following which, a frustrated Museveni told the BBC, "The Prime Minister of Canada came to see me and what was he talking about? Gays."
SNT.147700.1726	"Prime Minister Gordon Brown came to see me and what was he talking about? Gays."
SNT.147700.1727	In light of all that has occurred, Museveni told his party that the issue as of today was no longer a parliamentary one, and that it is to be discussed and handled accordingly by him and his cabinet alone.
SNT.1836.1728	Doctors from the Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Vienna say "there is no doubt" Ukrainian opposition leader Victor Yushchenko was poisoned with Dioxin.
SNT.1836.1729	Yushchenko's body had about 1,000 times more than the normal concentration of the toxin.
SNT.1836.1730	It is unknown if there were any other poisons in his system.
SNT.1836.1731	Although it has not yet been proven that the poisoning was deliberate, doctors suspect it was.
SNT.1836.1732	"We suspect a cause triggered by a third party," said Michael Zimpfer, head doctor at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic.
SNT.1836.1733	He suggested the poison may have been administered orally, through food or drink.
SNT.1836.1734	Today's announcements are a follow-up of an earlier press conference, where Dr. Korpan that there were three hypotheses under consideration, one of them involving dioxin.
SNT.1836.1735	He did not reveal what the other two hypotheses were.
SNT.1836.1736	Dr. Michael Zimpfer, director of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic emphasized that time there was no proof yet to specify the substance causing the illness.
SNT.1836.1737	Yushchenko left Kiev on Friday (2004-10-12) for further examination in Vienna.
SNT.1836.1738	When Yushchenko fell ill on October 6th, Ukrainian doctors had initially diagnosed food poisoning, leading to speculation that he had been poisoned deliberately.
SNT.1836.1739	The illness has disfigured Yushchenko's body and face which doctors say could take up to two years to heal.
SNT.1836.1740	He fell seriously ill on the September 6th, during his presidential campaign.
SNT.1836.1741	Yushchenko was taken to the Rudolfinerhaus clinic of Vienna, where he stayed for four days under Dr. Korpan's care.
SNT.1836.1742	He was diagnosed with "acute pancreatitis, accompanied by interstitial edematous changes."
SNT.1836.1743	These symptoms were said to be due to "a serious viral infection and chemical substances which are not normally found in food products" as his campaign officials put it.
SNT.1836.1744	In laymans terms, he developed an infection in the pancreas and got a bad skin condition that disfigured his face with cysts and lesions.
SNT.1836.1745	The skin condition has similarities with the chloracne associated with dioxin posioning according to a British toxicologist John Henry.
SNT.55948.1746	UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is at 3:30pm to present a White Paper in the House of Commons today indicating the Government’s plans to replace the Trident missile system with a similar system but on a reduced scale.
SNT.55948.1747	The speech is called : Statement: Trident - The Future of the UK Nuclear Deterrent.
SNT.55948.1748	The Trident defence system was developed as Britain’s response to the Cold War which ended with the collapse of the USSR in December 1991.
SNT.55948.1749	The first Trident submarine went on patrol in December 1994.
SNT.55948.1750	The present system consists of Trident ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads carried by four Vanguard class nuclear powered submarines.
SNT.55948.1751	The main issue is about the replacement of the submarine fleet.
SNT.55948.1752	Supporters who include the majority of the main opposition party, argue that because of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and threats from countries such as Iran and North Korea, Britain must have a nuclear defence capability.
SNT.55948.1753	Opponents including at least one Cabinet Minister and several Labour backbenchers, say that the system is an inappropriate response to the present threats to national security, terrorism, energy shortage and climate change and that there are better ways of spending the money.
SNT.55948.1754	Fifteen Anglican bishops have denounced the possession of such a weapon as ‘evil’.
SNT.55948.1755	Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), said that although Scotland had no power to stop the replacment of the Trident weapons system, it had a host of powers to protect the environment.
SNT.55948.1756	He promised that if the UK government went ahead with the Trident project, the SNP would propose to use those powers to stop it proceeding in Scotland.
SNT.55948.1757	There are two establishments in Scotland, at Faslane and Rosyth, providing services to the nuclear submarine fleet.
SNT.76990.1758	Three rescue workers at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah were killed trying to rescue six trapped miners who have been missing for over a week.
SNT.76990.1759	Utah's governor, Jon Huntsman, honored the dead rescuers by saying, "There's nothing more selfless than someone giving their life in pursuit of saving someone else."
SNT.76990.1760	Six other workers were injured in what is being called a seismic "bump."
SNT.76990.1761	Seismologists said a similar incident happened on the day of the original August 6 cave in.
SNT.76990.1762	A "bump" is caused by coal shooting out from the walls of a mine due to extreme pressure.
SNT.76990.1763	No further details were available about the official cause of the rescuers' deaths.
SNT.76990.1764	All rescue efforts to find the remaining six missing miners have been called off for now.
SNT.76990.1765	It is not known at this time if the six miners are alive or dead.
SNT.126442.1766	Most of the Eurovision entrants have returned home from their sojourn in Moscow, Russia, and the newspapers across Europe have varied opinions.
SNT.126442.1767	Most national newspapers congratulated their entrants on a job well done, while others trash-talked other entrants, and still others called for their countries to pull out of the Contest.
SNT.126442.1768	Here are some interviews, articles and opinions that made it to the front pages of newspapers and to their sanctioned blogs.
SNT.241367.1769	The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to sue a police officer accused of creating a story about being shot by someone at El Camino High School, causing a costly search for the assailant by police.
SNT.241367.1770	The officer, Jeffrey Stenroos, who had worked for the Los Angeles Unified School District police for eight years, caused thousands of students to remain on lockdown for hours.
SNT.241367.1771	Traffic officers, county sheriffs, California Highway Patrol, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were involved in the search.
SNT.241367.1772	The council voted to ask Stenroos to pay the city for the cost of the search.
SNT.241367.1773	Council president Eric Garcetti said, "We had thousands of dollars spent on police overtime."
SNT.241367.1774	Thursday, the Los Angeles Police chief announced Stenroos' claim was false and he was later arrested and released on $20,000 (€14,600) bail, charged with filing a false police report.
SNT.241367.1775	Stenroos allegedly mishandled a firearm and shot himself in his bulletproof vest, according to an anonymous police official.
SNT.9137.1776	A chemical part of the saliva of a poisonous lizard, the Gila monster, has become an integral partner in the control of Type 2 diabetes.
SNT.9137.1777	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its use for people who have not achieved adequate control of their diabetes with oral medications.
SNT.9137.1778	It is injected before eating morning and evening meals as part of a combination treatment with oral drugs.
SNT.9137.1779	The FDA said it could be approved as a stand-alone treatment if the drug companies can support such use with data.
SNT.9137.1780	Eli Lilly & Co. was the development partner in creation of the drug.
SNT.9137.1781	"With Byetta's demonstrated effects on blood sugar and its safety profile, physicians and patients now have a new approach to fight the growing diabetes epidemic," said Sidney Taurel, CEO of Lilly.
SNT.73670.1782	Microsoft has extended the warranty on its Xbox 360 video game console to three years from the date of purchase following a large number of problems with the console and "an unacceptable number of repairs", costing the company more than one billion US dollars.
SNT.73670.1783	The fault, which has been dubbed the "red ring of death", causes the console to fail completely.
SNT.73670.1784	In an open letter to owners of the Xbox 360, Peter Moore of Microsoft said, "As of today, all Xbox 360 consoles are covered by an enhanced warranty program to address specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights on the console."
SNT.73670.1785	The extended warranty covers repairing and shipping of the console and the company has promised to reimburse those owners who have already had to pay for repairs.
SNT.73670.1786	Microsoft has not released details of the number of units that have suffered from the problem but has said it is "bigger than we are comfortable with".
SNT.73670.1787	The Xbox 360 was launched by Microsoft in 2005 and in January of this year the company lowered its sales expectations to 12 million units for the year ending June 2007.
SNT.10022.1788	Kasey Kahne rode into victory early Sunday morning at Richmond International Raceway in the state of Virginia, USA, in his first Nascar Nextel Cup victory.
SNT.10022.1789	Kahne, who drives a Dodge, and is sponsored by the same company, won automaker competitor Chevrolet's sponsored race, the Chevy American Revolution 400.
SNT.10022.1790	The 25-year old from Huntersville, North Carolina had previously gained the pole position for Saturday's night race on Friday.
SNT.10022.1791	Early in the race, second-place finisher Tony Stewart took lead from Kahne, continuing on to lead over 100 cumulative laps in the race.
SNT.10022.1792	At lap 234 of 400, Stewart spun out coming out of the fourth turn, which resulted in Kahne regaining the lead.
SNT.10022.1793	After two more lead changes between the two, Kahne led the last 7 laps to take the checkered flag.
SNT.10022.1794	Points leader Jimmie Johnson crashed his car early into the race, taking a last-place finish.
SNT.194136.1795	A 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit near the east coast of Honshu, Japan early Monday morning, according to the USGS.
SNT.194136.1796	The earthquake took place at 06:55:51 AM local time on July 5.
SNT.194136.1797	The earthquake occurred at a depth of 23.7 kilometres (14.7 miles) and the epicentre was located 120 kilometers to the east of Morioka, Honshu, 125 kilometers to the southeast of Hachinohe, 195 kilometers to the southeast of Aomori, Honshu and 510 kilometers to the northeast of Tokyo.
SNT.194136.1798	No tsunami warnings were issued, and the quake was not reported to have caused any major damage.
SNT.18687.1799	Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois, Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females.
SNT.18687.1800	The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.
SNT.18687.1801	By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually.
SNT.18687.1802	The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams.
SNT.18687.1803	A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.
SNT.18687.1804	The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.
SNT.18687.1805	"This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings," Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.
SNT.18687.1806	Professor Stormshak believes that "understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault [and] put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."
SNT.146629.1807	A 67-year-old man, Thomas Ouellette, of Bonita Springs, Florida was questioned by the FBI Monday after he brought fireworks onto an airliner.
SNT.146629.1808	Piedmont Airlines flight 4126, a Bombardier Dash 8, from Baltimore, Maryland landed safely and without complications in New York's LaGuardia Airport.
SNT.146629.1809	No suspicions were raised until cleaning crews found the pyrotechnics on the airplane.
SNT.146629.1810	The fireworks are currently being held as evidence by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police, owner of LaGuardia Airport.
SNT.146629.1811	Ouellette has been issued a summons to appear in federal court.
SNT.146629.1812	Pyrotechnics are banned on American flights and individuals face a $10,000 civil penalty for bringing them on board.
SNT.146629.1813	This case comes after an incident on December 25 when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian national, attempted to bomb an airliner with explosives concealed in his underpants.
SNT.112376.1814	Multiple news agencies, including the New York Times and CNET yesterday suggested that a campaign operative for Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate, worked on the Wikipedia article on her in the 24 hours before the vice presidential candidate was announced.
SNT.112376.1815	Wikinews has investigated the claim further, after seeing these allegations.
SNT.112376.1816	The user who added the content on Wikipedia was known as Young Trigg, and Wikinews has learned that the account was created at exactly 08:02 UTC on August 28.
SNT.112376.1817	Just eight minutes later the user made their first edit to Wikipedia.
SNT.112376.1818	In this first edit the user said that Palin "briefly worked as a sports reporter for local Anchorage television stations, while also working as a commercial fisherman with her husband, Todd, her high school sweetheart".
SNT.112376.1819	In the second edit Palin and her family were described as "avid outdoors enthusiasts."
SNT.112376.1820	This edit also said that "Sarah and her father would sometimes wake at three am to hunt moose before school, and the family would regularly run 5k and 10k races".
SNT.112376.1821	Some of the other edits say that Sarah was "brought to statewide attention because of whistleblowing on ethical violations by state Republican Party leaders," she played in a "championship game despite a stress fracture in her ankle, hitting a critical free throw in the last seconds," and she won a "scholarship to help pay her way through college."
SNT.112376.1822	Young Trigg also noted that "Palin holds a lifetime membership with the National Rifle Association".
SNT.112376.1823	The editor also said that her election of mayor came "despite the lack of support from party leaders and being outspent by her Democratic opponent."
SNT.112376.1824	Other positive claims added included the statement that "Palin successfully killed the Bridge to Nowhere project that had become a nationwide symbol of wasteful earmark spending".
SNT.112376.1825	Young Trigg also removed the sentence that said that "critics [of Palin] included the state Republican party's chairman, Randy Ruedrich, one of her fellow Oil & Gas commissioners".
SNT.112376.1826	This unusual editing pattern aroused some suspicion among other editors of Wikipedia.
SNT.112376.1827	One of these editors is Justen Deal, who told Young Trigg that "some of yours edits may have affected the article in such a way so as to reflect more favorably on the subject of the article."
SNT.112376.1828	Deal described his reason for suspecting a conflict of interest to a reporter for Wikinews.
SNT.112376.1829	He said that "It was clear to me that an editor very familiar with Wikipedia and the governor had made a single-purpose account that had made a significant number of edits that were universally favorable to the subject of the article."
SNT.112376.1830	"Given the fortuitous timing, it made sense to remind the editor of our conflict of interest guidelines".
SNT.112376.1831	After this message was sent by Deal, Young Trigg said that "I will acknowledge that I volunteer for the McCain campaign."
SNT.112376.1832	The user did however state that "I did not know Palin was the nominee when I made my edits," and "no one instructed me to make these edits."
SNT.112376.1833	"I did this on my own 'becuz' I like improving Wikipedia articles".
SNT.112376.1834	Young Trigg made a total of 43 contributions (many on talk pages) and announced they would retire from Wikipedia at 07:58 UTC on August 31.
SNT.112376.1835	In addition to editing the article on Sarah Palin, the user also asked an anonymous contributor to Wikipedia about that person's edit that stated that Palin was the VP nominee, before the official announcement:
SNT.112376.1836	Wikinews contacted the McCain campaign with a request for a statement regarding this issue; and, at the time of publication, had not received a response.
SNT.113200.1837	Following misleading reports that Rev Professor Michael Reiss had advocated that creation should be taught in science class, he left his post as director of education at the Royal Society, the UK's national academy of science.
SNT.113200.1838	Last week at the British Association's science festival Rev Professor Michael Reiss said that creation should not be ignored if it come up in class.
SNT.113200.1839	Professor Reiss, who was director of education at the Royal Society, said that since a substantial number of pupils have concerns about the issue, they are likely to "detach from" science if their concerns and world view are not addressed.
SNT.113200.1840	Creation should not be taught, he said, but if it comes up, teachers should be encouraged to explain the science of evolution.
SNT.113200.1841	He also said that students should be taught the nature of a scientific theory - that it does not simply mean a hypothesis about the way things might work, but a rigorously supported system of ideas that fit with the available evidence.
SNT.113200.1842	The Times of London reported him as saying that Creationism should be taught in science classes as a legitimate point of view.
SNT.113200.1843	This provoked a storm of protest from a group that included two Nobel Laureates and other scientists who strongly oppose the teaching, or even the discussion of creation in science class.
SNT.113200.1844	Yesterday the Royal Society said in a statement that some of Professor Reiss' comments had been "open to misinterpretation", and that this had damaged the Society's reputation.
SNT.113200.1845	"As a result, Professor Reiss and the Royal Society have agreed that, in the best interests of the society, he will step down immediately as director of education."
SNT.113200.1846	The Royal Society went on to say: "However, if a young person raises creationism in a science class, teachers should be in a position to explain why evolution is a sound scientific theory and why creationism is not, in any way, scientific."
SNT.113200.1847	The chief executive of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Roland Jackson, said that the Royal Society should have supported Professor Reiss and used this opportunity to further a reasoned debate.
SNT.113200.1848	"I was at the actual discussion, and what I heard him say, however it has been reported, was essentially the position advocated by the Royal Society," Jackson said.
SNT.59150.1849	French Presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy has promised to address what he calls the French "moral crisis... of work".
SNT.59150.1850	With unemployment for younger people running at alarming levels (15.5% in 2002 for those aged between 20 and 24 according to the OECD) and the memory of the 2005 riots still recent, Sarkozy promised to reign in government spending and implement tax policies that reward longer working hours.
SNT.59150.1851	Once a matter of pride, the 35 hour maximum working week is seen by Mr. Sarkozy as contributing to the sluggish growth of the French economy.
SNT.59150.1852	In previous years France's aversion to "anglo-saxon" economic and labour policies contributed to the rejection of the EU constitution in a referendum last year.
SNT.59150.1853	However, such views are now being challenged by the French right's main Presidential candidate as he proposes to abolish tax on hours worked above the 35 hours limit as well as proposing to introduce new measures to increase share options for employees outside of the managerial elite.
SNT.59150.1854	As well as challenging France's work ethic he is planning to roll back the boundaries of the State by adopting policies that will reduce the size of State organisations to allow for tax reductions in the hope of kick-starting the economy.
SNT.59150.1855	The effect of his tax and spend reduction plans on state social provision has not yet been explained.
SNT.59150.1856	Reaction from Socialist candidate Ségolène Royal was immediate in describing his proposal as "scandalous" and that tax reductions on the richest on society would aggravate the already existing social divisions in the country.
SNT.59150.1857	She argues that State spending on public services were essential at a time when such divisions existed in the country.
SNT.59150.1858	Mr. Sarkozy is currently pulling ahead in the polls one week after announcing his candidacy for the May poll.
SNT.16444.1859	Police briefly cordoned off Mile-End tube station in East London on Saturday morning.
SNT.16444.1860	A man has been taken away and the alert has now been lifted.
SNT.16444.1861	This is the latest of many security alerts in London, which is at a high state of alert.
SNT.260719.1862	The Swedish Navy have released a picture regarding a foreign submarine discovered in the Saltsjöbaden river of Lake Mälaren in Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden, situated on the western coast of the Baltic Sea.
SNT.260719.1863	The submarine was seen by Hanna Harge, a 40-year-old entrepreneur who lives locally, when walking with her dog on the morning of 13 April this year.
SNT.260719.1864	She woke up her family, brought them to the location and took pictures of the submarine, before it disappeared.
SNT.260719.1865	She and her family immediately called the Swedish Navy, believing it to be an exercise, and told them to hide the vessel better.
SNT.260719.1866	The Navy, however, had no knowledge of such an exercise, and no reports from other nations regarding the submarine.
SNT.260719.1867	Soon afterwards, the Navy's intelligence agency visited Harge, taking the pictures to technical staff.
SNT.260719.1868	The Harge family compares them to the submarines of the former Soviet Union and the early Russian Federation which allegedly violated Sweden's border in the same vicinity.
SNT.260719.1869	In addition to the Armed Forces of Sweden, other government agencies are also involved in the investigation such as SMHI and Environmental Protection Agency.
SNT.260719.1870	According to Andersson Larsson of the technical staff, the proceedings of the investigation are classified and it is expected to be finished and sent to the Government of Sweden within two months.
SNT.42707.1871	In a small-scale trial on humans, American scientists say they may have developed a new drug that could stop the spread of HIV and "rapidly clears" the blood of the virus.
SNT.42707.1872	"There is a lot of interest in this product," said editor Keith Alcorn of the National Aids Manual.
SNT.42707.1873	The drug called PA-457, which is derived from betulinic acid and comes from by-products from paper manufacturers, is being manufactured and developed by Maryland drug manufacturer Panacos Pharmaceuticals.
SNT.42707.1874	The drug is known as a maturation inhibitor, which is a new group of drugs.
SNT.42707.1875	Its purpose is to break down the protective protein coating of HIV.
SNT.42707.1876	The drug exposes the inner genetic material by making holes in the coating of the virus essentially causing it to break down and disabling its ability to be passed from one human to the next.
SNT.42707.1877	The drug also shows that it works on strains of HIV that are resistant to other medications.
SNT.42707.1878	"It's a truly novel new class of drugs, and I really support their development."
SNT.42707.1879	"If PA-457 turns out to be non-toxic, easy to use and not to select for resistance, it will find good use," said Charles Boucher who researches HIV at Utrecht university medical center in the Netherlands.
SNT.42707.1880	"It stops the virus by interfering in one of the final stages in its assembly and stops it from 'budding out' from the wall of a cell," said Alcorn.
SNT.42707.1881	Scientists are expected to begin a larger scale test on 48 people in one month, whose drugs are no longer working; however, the drug itself is not likely to be available for wide-scale use for at least 3 years.
SNT.42707.1882	Test subjects will be administered either a placebo or PA-457 that will be taken in combination with the medication they already take.
SNT.42707.1883	"This provides the basis for future studies that will be designed to provide a detailed understanding of the interaction between PA-457 and its target as well as insights into the design of new generations of maturation inhibitors," said CEO of Panacos Pharmaceuticals, Graham Allaway.
SNT.42707.1884	At least 80% of those suffering from the disease have shown resistance to other medications.
SNT.677055.1885	In the United Kingdom, television presenter Derek Batey has died at the age of 84.
SNT.677055.1886	Yesterday, ITV Border, the company for whom he used to work, said Batey died Sunday night in a hospice near his Lytham St Annes residence in Lancashire, England after experiencing a brief illness.
SNT.677055.1887	Batey, who was born in Brampton, Carlisle in 1928, was at one time a ventriloquist.
SNT.677055.1888	According to BBC News Online, Batey first worked in broadcasting for the BBC.
SNT.677055.1889	He went on to work for Carlisle-based Border Television, which is now called ITV Border, from its inception in 1961.
SNT.677055.1890	He continued to work at the station for about 25 years, gaining the nickname 'Mr Border' as a result.
SNT.677055.1891	Batey was notable for presenting the game show Mr. and Mrs., a format which he developed for Border Television after seeing a similar game show on Canadian television.
SNT.677055.1892	Batey presented 500 episodes of the TV programme, which tested married persons on their knowledge of their partners to see which which couple had the best knowledge of each other.
SNT.677055.1893	At its peak in the 1970s, the programme achieved nine million viewers.
SNT.677055.1894	Batey adapted the game show into a successful stage show which he presented 5000 times.
SNT.677055.1895	Batey also presented a talk show called Look Who's Talking.
SNT.677055.1896	Recalling the basis for the launch of the series, Batey said: "[T]here wasn't a lot of theatre in the Border area and we thought if we could bring the national names to Carlisle and invite the audiences in, it is a chance to see names where they couldn't see elsewhere, so we did that."
SNT.677055.1897	Both Mr. and Mrs. and Look Who's Talking were originally regional programmes and were later broadcast across the ITV Network, Batey reported.
SNT.677055.1898	Harry King, a former colleague and friend of Derek Batey, described him as "a proud Cumbrian [...] a people person and was never happier than when he was talking to people."
SNT.677055.1899	"He could be talking to the Queen or the person next door".
SNT.677055.1900	King described Mr. and Mrs. as "iconic" and said Batey "would always let the people he was talking to take the limelight".
SNT.677055.1901	ITV News Border reporter Matthew Taylor said Batey "will leave a lasting legacy in this region".
SNT.57126.1902	James Brown, often referred to as the Godfather of Soul, died in Atlanta due to congestive heart failure, combined with pneumonia.
SNT.57126.1903	His death at age 73 was announced by his agent.
SNT.57126.1904	After his dentist noticed something unusual with him, Brown was told to visit a doctor immediately.
SNT.57126.1905	He was taken into the hospital yesterday for treatment of his pneumonia until his death at around 1:45 AM (6:45 AM GMT).
SNT.57126.1906	It is not known whether he received a pneumonia vaccination, as recommended for people of his age.
SNT.57126.1907	He was born in 1933 and grew up in poverty until he formed James Brown & The Famous Flames.
SNT.57126.1908	His influence on 20th century music, from funk to hip hop was profound.
SNT.57126.1909	Before he died, he scheduled a New Year's Eve concert series in New Jersey and New York that would help kick off a 2007 tour.
SNT.54371.1910	Chicago peace activist and musician Malachi Ritscher burned himself alive Friday morning (Nov. 3, 2006) on the Kennedy Expressway, apparently in protest of the Iraq war.
SNT.54371.1911	Police found a homemade sign near his body which said "Thou Shalt Not Kill."
SNT.54371.1912	Before the act, he posted a suicide note on his website.
SNT.24217.1913	Saddam Hussein pleaded "not guilty" at the opening of the al-Dujail trial on Wednesday.
SNT.24217.1914	The court recessed for 6 weeks during which time his defense will be prepared.
SNT.24217.1915	During the proceeding, Hussein argued that the judge was not appointed by him, and thus was not legitimate.
SNT.24217.1916	A tribunal of five Iraqi judges headed by Rizgar Mohammed Amin, with the death penalty vested in them, will decide his sentence.
SNT.118494.1917	The United Kingdom Parliament is planning to expand the powers of bailiffs in pursuit of unpaid debts.
SNT.118494.1918	While the new measures are not yet officially active, bailiffs are expected to soon be able to use force in entering debtors' homes and restraining them.
SNT.118494.1919	The preemptive crackdown was introduced with predictions of hundreds of thousands of British citizens losing their homes to credit companies as the international financial crisis grows worse.
SNT.118494.1920	Previous to the proposed laws, bailiffs were not allowed to break into or enter homes unless the debtor was already there, or as a last resort.
SNT.118494.1921	Justice Lord Bach stated the Act would not be made active until after Parliament had finished extensive consulting, and that the new powers of bailiffs would be carefully monitored.
SNT.118494.1922	Civil rights activists like Paul Nicolson of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, however, have heavily criticized the new laws, accusing them of destroying fundamental civil rights and stripping away "tried and tested protections that make a person's home his castle and which have stood for centuries".
SNT.118494.1923	A government spokesman said the Parliament was considering its options for implementing the new laws and would make an announcement soon.
SNT.197158.1924	Chris Christie, governor of the US state of New Jersey, complained on ABC's Sunday morning talk show This Week that TV series Jersey Shore promotes a negative image of the state.
SNT.197158.1925	Prompted by a feature in The New York Times on Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, one of the stars of the MTV show, interviewer Jake Tapper asked the governor whether he thought the series was positive or negative for the state.
SNT.197158.1926	Christie unequivocally answered that the show was "negative for New Jersey..."
SNT.197158.1927	"It takes a bunch of New Yorkers, drops them on the Jersey Shore, and tries to make America feel like this is New Jersey".
SNT.197158.1928	He concluded, "I can tell people: they want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time."
SNT.197158.1929	In a wide-ranging interview the governor also faced questions about local and national politics, including New Jersey's US$11 billion budget deficit.
SNT.197158.1930	Specifically, he was challenged over his plans to not pay $3 billion into public pension funds, payments described by the interviewer as a "legal obligation".
SNT.197158.1931	He said that he "wasn't going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system" and that there would be further reforms of pensions and health benefits.
SNT.197158.1932	Christie was further questioned over his ongoing conflicts with teachers unions.
SNT.197158.1933	He responded that "we can't have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession, at the cost to people who have been hurt by the recession the most", citing the example of construction unions in New Jersey currently suffering unemployment between 35 and 50%.
SNT.128045.1934	Sir Alan Sugar will continue to front the BBC series The Apprentice after his appointment as "enterprise tsar" for the British government.
SNT.128045.1935	Sugar will return as host for the sixth series in the spring of next year.
SNT.128045.1936	Sugar was previously being pushed to choose between the roles.
SNT.128045.1937	The BBC released a statement saying that "The BBC is satisfied that [Sir Alan's] new role as an Enterprise Champion to the government will not compromise the BBC's impartiality or his ability to present The Apprentice."
SNT.128045.1938	Critics have raised concerns over Sir Alan holding both roles.
SNT.128045.1939	They commented that they have stated that it would breach the BBC's impartiality rules.
SNT.128045.1940	The Conservatives said that it would be impossible for him to continue both roles.
SNT.128045.1941	They added the fact that the next series is due to start during the build up to a possible General Election.
SNT.421036.1942	According to a new diagnosis by a surgical pathologist, Frida Kahlo most likely suffered uterine damage during a streetcar accident as a teenager and this led to a rare condition known as Asherman's syndrome, and that would explain the Mexican artist's infertility.
SNT.421036.1943	Dr. Fernando Antelo, from the Harbor–UCLA Medical Center, said, "Her survival defied the grim prognostication by her physicians; however, complications from this physical trauma would emerge in her adulthood."
SNT.421036.1944	He presented his diagnosis yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Association of Anatomists in San Diego.
SNT.421036.1945	Asherman's syndrome is normally caused by a trauma to the uterus that results in internal scar tissue.
SNT.421036.1946	For example, it can occur after multiple procedures to clear the uterus after a miscarriage or abortion, which is known as a "D & C" procedure.
SNT.421036.1947	Antelo said Kahlo tried to have children many times and her miscarriages, as well as three therapeutic abortions, could have further aggravated the scarring.
SNT.421036.1948	At present the condition could be diagnosed and treated after advancements in medical imaging and hysteroscopy, but in Kahlo's time, Dr. Antelo said, the technology had not advanced far enough to diagnose and treat her.
SNT.421036.1949	Asherman's syndrome has been known since 1894 when it was first reported.
SNT.421036.1950	"She kept attempting to have children with a uterus that wasn't in any condition to do that," Antelo said.
SNT.421036.1951	Antelo, who has been working on connections between art and medicine, says that Kahlo brought her infertility to the canvas and this can be seen in her many paintings of reproductive organs or in her depiction of her own bleeding body in the 1932 painting Henry Ford Hospital.
SNT.421036.1952	In that image, Kahlo is shown lying on a hospital bed with multiple umbilical cords extending from her body and each one holds an object or body part, except one holding a baby.
SNT.103776.1953	Manchester United and Barcelona will face off in the Champions League semi-finals after both teams won their quarterfinal matches.

SNT.108953.1955	Abkhazia, a region located within the internationally recognised borders of Georgia, but which is a de facto independent republic without international recognition, has closed its border with the country following recent bomb blasts.
SNT.108953.1956	Several people have been injured in the blasts which occurred today and on Sunday when two bombs exploded in Gagra.
SNT.108953.1957	Abkhazia broke away from Georgia after the early 1990s war when separatists defeated Georgian forces and commenced a campaign of ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia.
SNT.108953.1958	The region's foreign minister said, "Georgia's aim is to destabilise the economic situation in Abkhazia."
SNT.108953.1959	Georgian authorities have denied any involvement in the bomb blasts.
SNT.108953.1960	Shota Utiashvili ,an interior ministry spokesman, said, "It will be a humanitarian catastrophe if the border is closed."
SNT.108953.1961	"Thousands of Georgians in Abkhazia cross the border to get pensions, do their shopping and work".
SNT.108953.1962	Russia, which is said to support the separatist forces, have peacekeeping troops within the region but this has been described as an occupying force by Georgia and Russia accused of trying to take over the region by stealth.
SNT.108953.1963	The border will be shut from tomorrow as security in the region is tightened.
SNT.15222.1964	Serie A champions Juventus have confirmed the $24,000,000 (£13,700,000, €20,000,000) capture of Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira.

SNT.712065.1976	"Our thoughts are with the postman's family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time", the spokesperson added.
SNT.712065.1977	Police do not intend to disclose any further information about the incident until relatives of the deceased have been informed of the incident.
SNT.712065.1978	No other vehicles are thought to have been involved; the Northern Constabulary has not yet said if it is looking for any other persons in relation to the fatality.
SNT.385377.1979	The Kenyan government has dismissed 25,000 striking health workers, mostly nurses, citing failure to heed government orders to recommence work and concern for the welfare of hospital patients.
SNT.385377.1980	The workers, who had been on strike for four days, were wishing to have improvements made to their wages, working conditions, and allowances.
SNT.385377.1981	The strikes have caused a significant number of Kenyan hospitals to cease operations.
SNT.385377.1982	According to Kenya Health Professionals Society spokesperson Alex Orina, the average monthly wage plus allowances for health workers in Kenya is KSh25,000 (£193, US$302 or €230) approximately.
SNT.385377.1983	With an increasing number of reports of patients neglected in hospitals emerging, two trade unions met with the Kenyan government yesterday and negotitated a return to work, although a significant proportion of demonstrators defied the agreement, The Guardian reported.
SNT.385377.1984	Orina told Reuters the dismissals were "cat-and-mouse games, you cannot sack an entire workforce."
SNT.385377.1985	"It is a ploy to get us to rush back to work, but our strike continues until our demands are met".
SNT.385377.1986	Frederick Omiah, a member of the same society, believed the government's actions would "make an already delicate and volatile situation worse", expressing concern that demonstrations may continue in the capital Nairobi, amongst other locations.
SNT.385377.1987	Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union chairperson Dr. Victor Ng'ani described government actions as "reckless".
SNT.385377.1988	Mutua said the health workers were "no longer employees of the government" and had been eliminated from the payroll.
SNT.385377.1989	While Ng'ani told the BBC of difficulties with finding other workers as skilled and experienced, Mutua reportedly stated that this would not be an issue.
SNT.385377.1990	"We have over 100,000 to 200,000 health professionals looking for work today," Mutua commented.
SNT.385377.1991	"There will be a lag of a day or two ... but it is better than letting people die on the floor, at the gate, or suffer in pain".
SNT.20974.1992	Over the summer a customized distribution of the Linux (or GNU/Linux) operating system was installed on 2,460 desktops in the Italian South Tyrol province of Bolzano.
SNT.20974.1993	This deployment included all 70 of the province's private and public schools and affects more than 16,000 students.
SNT.20974.1994	The distribution installed, FUSS Soledad GNU/Linux, is a customized version of the popular Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
SNT.20974.1995	FUSS Soledad GNU/Linux has multi-language support and uses the GNOME desktop environment.
SNT.20974.1996	In addition to the desktops in the schools, more than 20,000 LiveCDs are scheduled to be created and given free of charge to the students and their families.
SNT.20974.1997	These LiveCDs allow students to use the same software on their home computers that they are going to use at school.
SNT.20974.1998	Project co-director Antonio Russo said, "With the participation of all the public and private schools, this will give to all the students, families, teachers, and operators from the educational world the opportunity to use a entirely free operating system, both at school and at home."
SNT.20974.1999	The switch was funded by the province of Bolzano, the European Social Fund, and the Center for Professional Formation in Italian Language.
SNT.1022735.2000	Earlier this week, Wikinews interviewed Sarah Walsh, a former Australian women's national soccer team (Matilidas) player, about women's football in the country.
SNT.1022735.2001	The Australian women's team is currently ranked ninth by FIFA, down one spot from the previous quarter when they were tied at eighth with the North Korea women's national football team.
SNT.1022735.2002	Meanwhile, Australia's men (Socceroos) are currently ranked 59th in the world, between the Burkina Faso and Slovakia national football team.
SNT.1022735.2003	Walsh retired from the national team in September of last year, after scoring 32 goals in 71 appearances.
SNT.1022735.2004	She was on Matildas side that qualified for the World Cup for the first time while playing in the Asian Football Confederation instead of the Oceania Football Confederation.
SNT.1022735.2005	She also played in two World Cup quarter-finals for the team.
SNT.1022735.2006	Playing in Australia's top level domestic league, the W-League, she won the league championship in 2009.
SNT.1022735.2007	Walsh played professionally in the United States for Sky Blue FC and Saint Louis Athletica.
SNT.1022735.2008	The Matildas are ranked 8th by FIFA in the latest rankings.
SNT.1022735.2009-1	Should media coverage correlate to team performance and internationally rankings?
SNT.1022735.2009-2	Is there an element of tall poppy syndrome in the coverage of the Socceroos?
SNT.1022735.2009-3	What other factors can be used to explain the relative differences in media attention other than performance?
SNT.1022735.2010	::Sarah Walsh: Traditionally in Australia, male sports have dominated media coverage.
SNT.1022735.2011	Slowly we are seeing women's sports feature more frequently in mainstream media publications.
SNT.1022735.2012	There is a growing interest in women's sports, especially women's national teams in general here in Australia.
SNT.1022735.2013	With time, the public will be exposed to more female sports on a daily basis and perhaps will build the same affections for these female sports.
SNT.1022735.2014	As a teenager, I was exposed to NRL living in Sydney, so naturally I have a strong interest in this game along with football (soccer).
SNT.1022735.2015	Young female teenagers today, have the option to turn the TV on and watch the W-league and follow their heroes.
SNT.1022735.2016	I believe in 5–10 years' time we will see a cultural change with regards to media coverage and gender bias.
SNT.1022735.2017	: What's the difference in style of play between the men and women's national teams?
SNT.1022735.2018	::Sarah Walsh: Men :: They appear to play a possession-based game working at effective possession combined with a developing system of pressing using our natural athleticism and high work rate as well as our cultural mental strength.
SNT.1022735.2019	::Sarah Walsh: Women ::The women seem to employ a more defensive and well organized "block" making it hard for teams to play through particularly in the middle and our back thirds utilizing transitional moments (BPO – BP) to good effect with quick attacks through the natural speed of certain players.
SNT.1022735.2020	: Why are the Matildas more successful in international competitions and ranking wise than the Socceroos?
SNT.1022735.2021	::Sarah Walsh: There could be a number of contributing factors.
SNT.1022735.2022	Given there is more financial support for men's national teams globally in general, I believe the competition across the board is more extensive.
SNT.1022735.2023	Due to this, there are more teams that compete at a higher level, so effectively this would make it difficult for the Socceroos to reach the same ranking as Matildas.
SNT.1022735.2024	: Why do you think men don't watch the Matildas in the same numbers as they watch the Socceroos?
SNT.1022735.2025	: Does the media feed into traditional Australian gender stereotypes by not covering elite women's sports?
SNT.1022735.2026-1	: What is your role in sports?
SNT.1022735.2026-2	Journalist?
SNT.1022735.2026-3	Academic?
SNT.1022735.2026-4	Sport administrator?
SNT.1022735.2026-5	Player?
SNT.1022735.2026-6	Please provide one to two sentence biography to contextualize your answers.
SNT.1022735.2027	::Sarah Walsh: I started playing football at 5 years of age.
SNT.1022735.2028	I made my debut for the Matildas at 21 (2004–2012) I have spent the past two years working in community football at FFA delivering a Drug and Alcohol program.
SNT.1022735.2029	I am currently the Women's Football Coordinator and Female Elite Player mentor at FFA.
SNT.1022735.2030	Actually on wikipedia if you would like to cut and paste all that info!
SNT.53081.2031	Brazilian driver Filipe Massa, driving for Ferrari, won the Brazilian Grand Prix at Autódromo José Carlos Pace in Interlagos, São Paulo.
SNT.53081.2032	Massa became the first Brazilian to win on home soil since Ayrton Senna in 1993.
SNT.53081.2033	Massa started from pole and controlled the race from start to the finish line.
SNT.53081.2034	Alonso, along with the second Renault driver, Giancarlo Fisichella who finished sixth, won the constructors' cup for their team with only five points ahead of Ferrari.
SNT.53081.2035	In the beginning of the third qualification session his car slowed down and forced him to start 10th on Sunday.
SNT.53081.2036	In the race he was almost on the back of Fisichella, but damaged his tyre in the overtaking attempt and lose all positions.
SNT.53081.2037	But the retiring champion was right on the back of Fisico for the second time near the end of the race.
SNT.53081.2038	Giancarlo made a crucial mistake prior to Senna's "S"-curve allowing Michael to pass him.
SNT.53081.2039	Must note that all Schumacher overtook most of the other drivers in the same turn.
SNT.53081.2040	The "Red Baron" set up the fastest time and the top speed record for this track.
SNT.53081.2041	Let's say the words Nick Heidfeld, Sauber-BMW team driver, wrote on the back of his aerodynamical spoiler - "Danke, Michael!".
SNT.53081.2042	Danke, Michael, for the fantastic race and so many seasons together.
SNT.53081.2043	Rubens Barrichello (Honda, Pedro de la Rosa (McLaren-Mercedes) and Poland Robert Kubica (Sauber-BMW) were 7-th, 8-th and 9-th respectfully.
SNT.53081.2044	Takuma Sato closed the season with 10-th place, first who finished in one lap after the winner, the best result for Super Aguri-Honda team.
SNT.53081.2045	With ten laps to go, the most surprising event was Kimi's resistance when his open wheels untimely overlapped with Michael's, especially when one knows Kimi will run with Ferrari next season.
SNT.187876.2046	The Canadian Government is watching the "slowing growth" of the BP oil spill.
SNT.187876.2047	Canada is running their dash-8 on a twice a day mission to the gulf, monitoring for signs that the BP Oil slick may expand up the Eastern seaboard into Canadian waters, and to provide assistance to US efforts to contain the spill.
SNT.187876.2048	This started in May, and is expected to continue until the spill has been fully contained, or no longer needed.
SNT.187876.2049	Canada has also provided technical experts, research and development teams, and general staffing to assist in spill containment and cleanup.
SNT.187876.2050	While the risk is slim that the oil slick will move up the seaboard enough to get into Canadian waters, it is possible.
SNT.187876.2051	Currently the spill is being held within the Gulf of Mexico, however, as the spill grows each day it is at bigger risk of being picked up by the Loop Current.
SNT.187876.2052	If oil is swept up into the Loop Current—which moves at about 3.3 to 6.5 feet (one to two meters) a second—there's essentially no way to stop it, Tony Sturges, professor emeritus of oceanography at Florida State University, told National Geographic.
SNT.187876.2053	After being picked up by the Loop Current, the oil spill could then quickly be carried further by the Gulf Stream, which can travel up to 2.5 metres per second (5.6 mph).
SNT.187876.2054	This current leads right through some of Canada's best fishing waters, and could potentially even be washed up directly onto the shores of Canada, if not properly contained.
SNT.187876.2055	This spill could devastate the fishing industry of Canada, and harm any potential tourism on the beautiful coastal waters of Eastern Canada.
SNT.187876.2056	So while Canada is offering its hand to the United States as a gesture of assistance, it serves dually as a self assurance that Canada will not be affected by the spill, and to stop it before it reaches the border if it does get picked up by the currents.
SNT.108970.2057	United States President George W. Bush today signed a bill providing $162 billion for the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which intends to fund the wars for the rest of Bush's term and well into the first year of the new President's term.
SNT.108970.2058	In addition to war funds, the bill includes educational benefits for young troops and veterans, a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits, $2.7 billion in emergency relief for victims of the Midwest floods, and billions of dollars for items such as international food aid, anti-drug enforcement, and repairs of Louisiana levees.
SNT.108970.2059	At a ceremony in the White House's Oval Office, Bush praised the legislation as a necessary product of bipartisanship.
SNT.108970.2060	I appreciate that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed to provide these vital funds without tying the hands of our commanders, and without an artificial timetable of withdrawal from Iraq.
SNT.108970.2061	This bill shows the American people that even in an election year, Republicans and Democrats can come together to stand behind our troops and their families.
SNT.108970.2062	Although not mentioned by Bush in his statement, the bill also waives an older law that restricted America's capacity to finance the removal of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
SNT.108970.2063	The absence of the waiver could have led to an embarrassing situation where progress on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program would have been delayed because of a technicality, said Leonor Tomero of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.
SNT.108970.2064	North Korea was recently removed from a U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism, as a reward for turning over all documents relating to the country's nuclear program.
SNT.108970.2065	For months, the Democrats and Republicans in Congress had argued over the bill, forcing several compromises to be made in the form of amendments.
SNT.108970.2066	One of these amendments, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, can be described as a modern version of the World War II-era G.I.
SNT.108970.2067	It provides lower college tuition costs for war veterans, which was originally opposed by Bush and Senate Republicans, including Presidential candidate John McCain.
SNT.108970.2068	The Republicans conceded after Democrats agreed to add "transferability" to the bill, which allows veterans to transfer the benefits to family members.
SNT.108970.2069	Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid commented on the bill, saying, "At a time when 2 million men and women have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and when our troops have had to endure multiple deployments ... and an unclear strategy, giving them the opportunity to fuel our future economy is the least we can do."
SNT.108970.2070	With the passing of this bill, Congress has provided $650 billion for the Iraq War effort, and nearly $200 billion for war operations in Afghanistan.
SNT.41134.2071	The United Nations Committee against Torture told the United States today that the US should close its detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as well as disclose the existence of any secret prisons it operates.
SNT.41134.2072	The committee, made up of 10 independent experts has urged the Bush administration to put a stop to the use of torture or cruel treatment during the interrogation of terror suspects.
SNT.41134.2073	In an 11-page report, the committee said that the US should not detain anyone in a secret facility under its control.
SNT.41134.2074	The committee also said that the US should disclose and investigate any such facilities.
SNT.41134.2075	It is alleged that the US has a number of secret prisons where suspects are transported to and questioned using techniques that violate international human rights conventions.
SNT.41134.2076	Earlier this month, the US sent 30 officials to a torture committee hearing in Geneva.
SNT.41134.2077	The delegation was criticized for failing to comment on questions relating to America's alleged secret prisons.
SNT.41134.2078	The committee ruled that there was evidence that US military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan had violated the rights of some detainees.
SNT.41134.2079	The committee said that some of the US' techniques had resulted in the deaths of prisoners during the interrogation process.
SNT.41134.2080	The committee further claimed that "vague" guidelines had led to abuse of detainees.
SNT.41134.2081	According to the Associated Press, John B. Bellinger III, a State Department legal advisor and participant during the hearings at Geneva, said of the recommendation to close the base that, "one, seems to be beyond their mandate; two, legally wrong to say that the existence of Guantanamo is a per se violation of the convention; and, three, a not very practical recommendation given that they say that it ought to be closed but that individuals can't be sent back to a large number of countries."
SNT.41134.2082	President Bush said previously on ARD German television that he wants to close the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp.
SNT.41134.2083	According to White House spokesman Tony Snow, the President is waiting for the US Supreme Court to decide on the issue of whether military tribunals or civilian courts would try the detainees.
SNT.188098.2084	On Friday, the 189 Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) agreed to a final resolution calling for steps toward the banning of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the Middle East.
SNT.188098.2085	The resolution directs United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to organize a conference of all the Middle East states.
SNT.188098.2086	The resolution singles out Israel, calling on "all states in the Middle East that have not yet done so to accede to the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states so as to achieve its universality at an early date."
SNT.188098.2087	In an official statement from the Prime Minister's Office, Israel said the resolution, "is deeply flawed and hypocritical."
SNT.188098.2088	"It ignores the realities of the Middle East and the real threats facing the region and the entire world."
SNT.188098.2089	The statement went on to state, "[the resolution] singles out Israel, the Middle East's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation."
SNT.188098.2090	"Yet the terrorist regime in Iran, which is racing to develop nuclear weapons and which openly threatens to wipe Israel off the map, is not even mentioned in the resolution."
SNT.188098.2091	An Arab-backed proposal for a WMD-Free zone in the Middle East, supported in 1995 by the NPT Conference, was never acted upon.
SNT.188098.2092	As a non-signatory state, Israel is not bound by any resolutions of the NPT.
SNT.56992.2093	President Niyazov of Turkmenistan had declared himself to be "President For Life" in 1999 after his last elected victory in 1992 and had not selected a successor.
SNT.56992.2094	His reign in Turkmenistan led to 21 years of relative peace within the country, but was not welcoming of diverse opinions and viewpoints throughout the culture.
SNT.56992.2095	Most opponents to his regime left the country over the last two decades as President Niyazov centralized his authority over the nation.
SNT.56992.2096	His rule over Turkmenistan came after years of service in the Communist Party of the USSR.
SNT.10993.2097	Newly named Prime Minister of France Dominique de Villepin has had his cabinet accepted by President of the Republic Jacques Chirac.
SNT.10993.2098	Head of the majority Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, Nicolas Sarkozy, comes as a second-in-command as Minister of the Interior, with the honorific rank of Minister of State.
SNT.10993.2099	The Ministry of the Interior is traditionally one of the most important positions in the cabinet, with that of Finances; the Minister of the Interior is in charge, notably, of law enforcement and relationships with local governments.
SNT.10993.2100	There is some uneasiness in having the head of a party in a position that is partly in charge of electoral redistrictings.
SNT.10993.2101	Also, this arrangement creates a peculiar situation: it is public knowledge that Villepin and Sarkozy consider each other a dangerous political rival with respect to the 2007 presidential election, and they are widely said to loathe each other.
SNT.10993.2102	However, as many as 31 ministers, delegate ministers and secretaries of state were named; still, this is a reduction from the preceding 43.
SNT.10993.2103	While the cabinet is for a large part copied from the preceding one, some ministers who had provoked controversy and animosity were removed or moved to another less risky position.
SNT.10993.2104	Dominique Perben, who pushed for controversial law which opponents allege curtail fundamental constitutional freedoms while Minister of Justice, was moved to the less sensitive position of Minister of Transportation and Equipment.
SNT.10993.2105	It is also possible that the movement of Brigitte Girardin from Minister for the Oversea (relationships with French overseas departments and territories) to (international) Cooperation was motivated by the crisis that occurred in French Polynesia between Gaston Flosse and his opponent Oscar Temaru.
SNT.10993.2106	While the Union for French Democracy (UDF) party, led by François Bayrou, formally remains in the ruling coalition along with the UMP, it has decided that, because the new government would probably do more of the same policies, it would not participate in it.
SNT.10993.2107	The only member of the government from UDF is Gilles de Robien, as in the preceding government.
SNT.10993.2108	Previous head of government Jean-Pierre Raffarin had lost the confidence of the French, with polls putting him as low as 22% confidence.
SNT.10993.2109	President Chirac's confidence among the citizenry is also a record low of 24%.
SNT.170669.2110	Twenty-five miners are confirmed dead, two injured, and four missing, after an explosion in a West Virginia coal mine Monday.
SNT.170669.2111	The incident occurred in the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, West Virginia.
SNT.170669.2112	It is the deadliest mining accident in the United States since 1984.
SNT.170669.2113	Search and rescue operations were suspended Tuesday due to high levels of methane gas which made conditions unsafe for rescuers.
SNT.170669.2114	A team attempting to ventilate the mine is expected to complete the work by Wednesday evening.
SNT.170669.2115	Officials said that it was unlikely that the missing miners were still alive, although they would not stop efforts until they were found.
SNT.170669.2116	The mine is owned by Massey Energy but operated by Performance Coal Company, a subsidiary of Massey, which is the fourth largest coal producer in the US.
SNT.170669.2117	Federal officials have fined Massey nearly US $900,000 after numerous safety violations were found at the mine that suffered the explosion.
SNT.170669.2118	US President Barack Obama held a prayer breakfast in the White House Tuesday morning.
SNT.170669.2119	He said that "I would ask for the faithful who are gathered here to pray for the safe return of the missing, the men and women who put their lives on the line to save them and the souls that have been lost in this tragic accident."
SNT.170669.2120	"May they rest in peace, and may their families find comfort in the hard days ahead."
SNT.111056.2121	The two dominant parties of Pakistan's National Assembly have united in a coalition to impeach President Pervez Musharraf.
SNT.111056.2122	The decision was announced by party leaders Asif Ali Zardari, widower of former premier Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif, with the parties aiming for a successful no-confidence vote against President Musharraf.
SNT.111056.2123	The impeachment process is planned to start within the following week.
SNT.111056.2124	There have been concerns that an attempt at impeachment would result in a detrimental political battle in a country already facing political instability.
SNT.111056.2125	A senior member of a party allied with Musharraf stated that the impeachment would "open a Pandora's box" regarding Pakistan's future.
SNT.111056.2126	Once the impeachment process begins, the coalition will need to muster a required two-thirds majority in order to successfully impeach Musharraf.
SNT.111056.2127	Musharraf has little support in the National Assembly, as most of his political allies were defeated in the February elections.
SNT.111056.2128	If the coalition is successful, Musharraf will be the first president in Pakistan's sixty-one year history to have been impeached.
SNT.111056.2129	Musharraf has canceled his trip to the Beijing Olympics so that he can focus on planning a response to the coalition.
SNT.111056.2130	Successfully defeating the impeachment will depend largely on the support of the military, for which he acted as chief until international pressure forced him to step down a year ago.
SNT.111056.2131	Other options Musharraf may explore include declaring a state of emergency, which could aid him in getting the support of the military, or dissolving parliament, though this would likely lead to political chaos.
SNT.49236.2132	Saturday, September 2nd, Wellington held a computer recycling day for free hosted by computer maker, Dell.
SNT.49236.2133	Now Auckland is looking to host one of their own.
SNT.49236.2134	During the recycling day, sponsored by Environment Ministry and Computer Access New Zealand Trust, Dell New Zealand took in more than 30 tonnes of obsolete equipment by 1,200 people at Wellington's Westpac Stadium.
SNT.49236.2135	Instead of the equipment going to a landfill where it is unable to decompose and will leak chemicals into the ground, 97% of all equipment collected will be recycled.
SNT.49236.2136	Susan McGregor, an Auckland City Council spokesperson, said: "There is a regional forum looking into waste disposal; but to date there is only a scheme for hazardous material to be collected separately by the council."
SNT.49236.2137	"It [the council] would welcome computer companies taking some responsibility for disposing of old computer ware."
SNT.49236.2138	Dell has indicated it will hold another PC clean up next year.
SNT.49236.2139	According to Dell, out of the 6.3 million New Zealand computers, 250,000 of them are old and obsolete, mainly because most computer owners, according to a survey, will upgrade their computers every two to five years.
SNT.49236.2140	Sydney, Australia had recently hosted one of their own computer recycling days; however Wellington's event was four times more successful.
SNT.145811.2141	Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is in San Raffaele Hospital overnight in Milan following an assault during an autograph session at the end of a rally.
SNT.145811.2142	The 73 year-old media mogul received a punch in the face from an assailant who police named as 42 year-old Massimo Tartaglia, a local man who has been undergoing mental health treatment for ten years.
SNT.145811.2143	Tartaglia was holding a replica of Milan's famous Domo Cathedral as he struck the premier; the composition of the replica is unknown, but eyewitnesses suggest it may have been made from marble, iron or another heavy material.
SNT.145811.2144	The assailant is currently in custody at a police station somewhere in Milan; police have confirmed he has no prior criminal record.
SNT.145811.2145	The attack on Berlusconi left him requiring treatment for damage to his mouth, a broken nose, cuts to his face and, according to reports from BBC News, at least two broken teeth.
SNT.145811.2146	This is not the only attack Berlusconi has received; several years ago a man hit him with a tripod, leaving him with a cut to his forehead.
SNT.117883.2147	More details have emerged over the weekend after the surprise announcement last week of Honda's intention to sell its Formula One racing team, Honda Racing F1.
SNT.117883.2148	The team management, Nick Fry and Ross Brawn, have already announced confidence in their ability not only to find a buyer for the team but also to deliver the performance expected of Honda's 2009 car.
SNT.117883.2149	Prices as low as £1 have been put forward as possible prices tags for the Northampton based team, with Honda CEO Takeo Fukui stating that "Just to make the team possible to exist, a small price tag is acceptable".
SNT.117883.2150	On Saturday the Japanese car giant said that before selling the team it was going to offer British driver Jensen Button, who had given the Honda team its only victory, a way out of his recently signed multi-million pound contract with the team so he could try to get a drive with other teams.
SNT.117883.2151	However, Ross Brawn appears eager to retain the Briton and either retain Brazilian Rubens Barrichello or sign GP2 driver Bruno Senna, nephew of legendary racer Ayrton Senna.
SNT.117883.2152	At an industry awards dinner, Button indicated his desire for a buyer to be found for Honda, saying any buyer would get "... a great team with excellent facilities."
SNT.117883.2153	"And with the leadership of Ross Brawn, and the whole team as they are, we can come through this and be on the grid in 2009."
SNT.117883.2154	Button has also spoken of his shock and pain at Honda's decision.
SNT.117883.2155	Ross Brawn, who was brought into the Honda team with much fan fare before the 2008 season, has spoken of his shock at finding out about the sale of the team.
SNT.117883.2156	Brawn, who is credited with helping Michael Schumacher and Ferrari dominate Formula One for much of the last decade, indicated he was expected funding cuts and had prepared a reduced budget but hadn't expected the full withdrawal of support that Honda announced.
SNT.117883.2157	Brawn has also indicated understanding of Honda's reasoning, with their sales down 40% in some markets and Honda F1's £200m+ budget a cost they were unwilling to bear.
SNT.117883.2158	Though Honda has committed to providing a budget for the team until March, the budget is lower than that which had been expected and so the team has had to pull out of the crucial winter tests at Jerez.
SNT.117883.2159	This has denied Formula One hopeful Bruno Senna another test with the team and has combined with the engine implications of Honda's withdrawal to push the new car's final testing from January to March, just weeks before the first Grand Prix in Australia.
SNT.117883.2160	Ross Brawn however remains confident of competing with new Formula One frontrunners BMW Sauber and Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has tipped the team as a great buy, saying "I've no doubt Honda would have been in top four next year without any problems."
SNT.117883.2161	"They've spent a lot of money to put themselves in that position so if anyone does want to be in F1 this is a team they should look to buy."
SNT.117883.2162	"It's a big opportunity for any company that's run efficiently to benefit."
SNT.9090.2163	Two activists who helped identify a vagrant Genetically Modified (GM) crop of papaya, which was later confirmed and destroyed by Thai officials, now face prison over their actions, says Greenpeace.
SNT.9090.2164	They were charged with theft, trespassing and destruction of property.
SNT.9090.2165	Instead of getting to the bottom of who precisely was responsible for the contamination, the very department that was responsible for the contamination decided to take legal action against Pat and Jay.
SNT.6041.2166	UN Secretary General Kofi Annan will formally present a plan this morning to the UN General Assembly when it meets in New York later today.
SNT.6041.2167	The plan, entitled In Larger Freedom, is part of the UN's attempt to revitalise itself during its sixtieth anniversary year.
SNT.6041.2168	If implemented, this plan will be the largest change ever to the international body, calling for the addition of nine members to the Security Council, and for the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the 53-member Human Rights Commission.
SNT.6041.2169	The Canadian ambassador to the UN, Allan Rock, was the first diplomat to officially respond by saying, "A lot of hard work lies ahead but we are optimistic."
SNT.6041.2170	Oxfam, Amnesty International, and other NGOs, have come out in support of the plan.
SNT.55359.2171	Nick Clarke, the UK radio broadcaster, died today from cancer at the age of 58.
SNT.55359.2172	He had worked for the BBC for over 20 years, and won the Broadcasting Press Guild Broadcaster of the year award in 2001, but was best known for presenting the Radio 4 news show, The World at One.
SNT.44079.2173	The Israeli Defence Forces have carried out 5 to 8 air strikes targeting the office of the Palestinian interior ministry's headquarters occupied by the governing party Hamas in Gaza and an office of President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party in Gaza, Palestinian and Israeli sources say.
SNT.44079.2174	There were mixed reports of casualties from the air strike, although one source said a member of Islamic Jihad had been killed in the air strikes.
SNT.44079.2175	The Israeli military said the ministry office, controlled by Hamas, was "a meeting place to plan and direct terror activity."
SNT.44079.2176	In addition, an Israeli official stated to the Associated Press that the attacks will only end when the captured Israeli soldier is unconditionally freed.
SNT.44079.2177	Days after the initial raid reports from Israeli officials stated that they had found the body of 18-year-old Eliyahu Yitzhak Asheri who was kidnapped by the Palestinian ruling party, Hamas, and shot in the back of the head on Sunday.
SNT.44079.2178	In his first appearance since the raid began, Palestinian PM and leader of the Hamas organization, Ismail Haniya denounced the raid saying it was a "premeditated plan" to bring down the new Hamas government.
SNT.119162.2179	A significant portion of the American LGBT media landscape is about to become a conglomerate.
SNT.119162.2180	(PlanetOut.com, Gay.com) sent out a press release stating it signed a definitive merger agreement with Here Networks LLC (operator of cable network here!) and Regent Entertainment Media Inc. (properties including magazines The Advocate, Out).
SNT.119162.2181	The deal comes after PlanetOut had been on the market for nearly a year.
SNT.119162.2182	The company sold its magazine and book publishing businesses back in April, and its vacation company in December.
SNT.119162.2183	The newly formed public holding company, Here Media Inc., will be helmed by Chairman Stephen P. Jarchow and CEO Paul Colichman.
SNT.119162.2184	Its unknown whether any of struggling PlanetOut's jobs will be cut.
SNT.119162.2185	Plans are for all three companies to operate separately, as of subsidiaries of Here Media.
SNT.119162.2186	The agreement still has to be approved by a majority of PlanetOut common stock holders, comply with regulatory filings and approvals, and meet various closing conditions.
SNT.119162.2187	PlanetOut shareholders will represent only 20% of Here Media Inc.'s shares.
SNT.47846.2188	A report by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) says rising demand for irrigation to produce food and biofuels will aggravate scarcities of water.
SNT.47846.2189	One in three people is enduring one form or another of water scarcity, states the report compiled by 700 experts.
SNT.47846.2190	IWMI warns there has to be a radical transformation in the management of water resources - citing as examples Australia, south-central China, and last year’s devastating drought in India.
SNT.47846.2191	Report authors claim that the price of water could double or triple over the next two decades.
SNT.47846.2192	The report, backed by the United Nations and farm research groups, shows that globally, water usage had increased by six times in the past 100 years and would double again by 2050 - driven mainly by irrigation and demands by agriculture.
SNT.47846.2193	Record oil prices and concerns about rapid onset climate change are driving more countries to produce biofuels - from sugarcane, corn or wood - as an alternative to fossil fuel.
SNT.47846.2194	If people are growing biofuels and food it will put another new stress, says David Molden, who led the study at the Sri Lanka-based IWMI.
SNT.47846.2195	The big solution is to find ways to grow more food with less water. 
SNT.47846.2196	" The number one recommendation... is to look to improve rain-fed systems in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia."
SNT.47846.2197	The report says conquering hunger and coping with an estimated 3 billion more humans by 2050 will result in an 80 percent increase in water use for agriculture.
SNT.47846.2198	Irrigation absorbs around 74 percent and is likely to surge by 2050.
SNT.47846.2199	We will have to change business as usual in order to deal with growing scarcity, said Frank Rijsberman, director general of the IWMI, of the report released at the 2006 "World Water Week" conference in Stockholm.
SNT.47846.2200	Solutions included helping poor countries to grow more food with available fresh water via simple, low-cost measures, a shift from past policies that favoured expensive dams or canals, the report said.
SNT.47846.2201	According to Rijsberman, there are two types of shortages: those observed in regions where water is over-exploited, causing a lowering of groundwater levels and rivers to dry up; and those in countries lacking the technical and financial resources to capture water - despite its abundance.
SNT.47846.2202	Billions of people in Asia and Africa already faced water shortages because of poor water management, he said.
SNT.47846.2203	We will not run out of bottled water any time soon, but some countries have already run out of water to produce their own food, he said.
SNT.47846.2204	The report said that a calorie of food took roughly 1 litre of water to produce, with a kilo of grain needing only 500-4,000 litres compared to a kilo of industrially produced meat taking 10,000 litres.
SNT.47846.2205	Without improvements in water productivity the consequences of this will be even more widespread water scarcity and rapidly increasing water prices.
SNT.47846.2206	Rijsberman said water scarcity in Africa was caused by a lack of infrastructure to get the water to the people who needed it.
SNT.47846.2207	The water is there, the rainfall is there, but the infrastructure isn't there, Rijsberman told reporters.
SNT.47846.2208	Other recommendations for certain regions include the extension and the improvement of agriculture using rainwater, the introduction of cereal varieties that need less water as well as the development of irrigation systems.
SNT.47846.2209	But the priority, Rijsberman stresses, is to change mentalities and often outdated government policies.
SNT.47846.2210	Government policies and their approach to water are probably the most urgent that need changing in the short term, he said.
SNT.47846.2211	There is, he says, enough land, water and human capacity to produce enough food for a growing population over the next 50 years, but one of the challenges is to provide enough water for agriculture without damaging the environment.
SNT.47846.2212	Agriculture is driving water scarcity and water scarcity is driving environmental degradation and destruction, he said.
SNT.47846.2213	In Australia last week, Rijsberman said he would "not be surprised to see the price of water double or triple over the next two decades."
SNT.9334.2214	On Thursday the 22nd of March, 2005, Anna Ayala, a woman from Las Vegas, claimed to have found a human finger in her bowl of chili at a Wendy's restaurant located at 1405 Monterey Highway, just south of downtown San Jose, California, owned by Fresno-based Jern Management..
SNT.9334.2215	The finger, which probably belonged to a woman as it had a long and manicured fingernail, did not belong to any of the restaurant employees.
SNT.9334.2216	The food supplies were seized by officials to be traced back to its manufacturers, while the restaurant was permitted to open again later with chili prepared from fresh ingredients.
SNT.142002.2217	A British soldier has been killed in Afghanistan, taking the number of British deaths there since 2001 to 222.
SNT.142002.2218	He was a member of the Royal Military Police, and was killed while on foot patrol in the Helmand province, close to the Gereshk district in Southern Afghanistan.
SNT.142002.2219	The cause of death has been reported to be an explosion, but the source is unclear.
SNT.142002.2220	It is my sad duty to confirm the death of a soldier, a Royal Military Policeman, in an explosion earlier today in Helmand Province, Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield said of the incident.
SNT.142002.2221	 He died doing his duty and we will remember him.
SNT.318388.2222	Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard supported the launch of a new book "How to Get Expelled from School: A Guide to Climate Change for Pupils, Pundits and Parents", authored by geology professor .
SNT.318388.2223	The book includes 101 questions for students to use to challenge their climate science teachers.
SNT.318388.2224	Professor Plimer said the previous book received feedback from parents concerned about education.
SNT.318388.2225	This prompted him to address the next book to children.
SNT.318388.2226	He said, "After Heaven and Earth came out I had many parents write to me and say, 'Look, what do we do, our kids are being fed activism."
SNT.318388.2227	"I want my children to have the basics of scientists, I don't want to be fed activism'."
SNT.318388.2228	He says he considered it feasible if the rest of the world acted too, otherwise to introduce carbon trading plans would risk Australian industries.
SNT.318388.2229	Professor Ian Enting, complex system scientist at the University of Melbourne, said the book includes scientific errors and insufficient references.
SNT.318388.2230	Margaret Watts, president of the Science Teachers' Association of New South Wales, said the educational bias claim is mistaken.
SNT.318388.2231	What science teachers do, she said, "is put all of the facts, pro and con, against any topic, whatever it is, and show the children how to work through the evidence".
SNT.318388.2232	Professor Plimer said of the 101 questions in his book, "They're questions that kids should be asking of teachers, because if the teacher can answer it means they might know something about the subject."
SNT.318388.2233	"If they can't, or start to promote ideology, it shows that our schools have been captured."
SNT.318388.2234	"Parents are telling me that schools have been captured by a lot of activists and kids are being fed stuff that is not relevant to the real world."
SNT.7864.2235	At the recently held 22nd ICANN International Conference in Mar del Plata, Argentina, the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), officially designated three new top level domain names: .jobs and .travel and .eu.
SNT.7864.2236	Tralliance will operate the new .travel domain and Employ Media will operate the .jobs. domain.
SNT.7864.2237	.jobs was created for the use of personnel businesses, .travel for the travel industry, and .eu will be used by organizations based in the European Union.
SNT.7864.2238	ICANN has also entered into negotiations with registries for .cat, .post and .mobi domains.
SNT.7864.2239	The ICANN, established by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1998, is a non-profit corporation responsible for the technical coordination of the Internet through the assignment of domain names and IP addresses.
SNT.89267.2240	The People's Republic of China has banned free plastic shopping bags in a move to take effect from June 1, 2008.
SNT.89267.2241	The decision made by the Chinese Cabinet, the State Council, is intended to reduce the amount of plastic bags used in China, currently being estimated at three billion per day.
SNT.89267.2242	The State Council also announced that at the same time as the ban, the manufacturing, sale and even use of very thin plastic bags, which are defined as being under 0.025mm thick, will be banned.
SNT.89267.2243	Any company that does not follow this ban can be fined.
SNT.89267.2244	The ban of free plastic bags and complete ban on very thin bags will, the government hopes, help reduce the amount of crude oil used for plastic packaging, which is currently at five million tonnes per year according to Times Online.
SNT.89267.2245	The notice issued by the Chinese government said: "We should encourage people to return to carrying cloth bags, using baskets for their vegetables."
SNT.89267.2246	The People's Republic of China is not the first country to ban or restrict plastic shopping bags and the notice names Uganda and South Africa according to CNN.
SNT.89267.2247	Many supermarkets in the European Union have voluntarily adopted methods to reduce usage of plastic bags, which often also consist of charging for bags (e.g. Germany) or rewarding customer loyalty points for returning used carrier bags.
SNT.89267.2248	Still, many of the world's leading polluting countries, including the United States of America, have not yet introduced any legislation intended to reduce the usage of plastic bags.
SNT.89267.2249	The United States Environmental Protection Agency claimed that in 2000 only 1% of plastic bags in the United States were recycled.
SNT.89267.2250	The People's Republic of China has attracted a lot of attention in the past for having possibly the highest greenhouse emissions in the world, disproportionate to the size of its economy, according to The Telegraph.
SNT.89267.2251	Times Online quoted a Chinese activist as saying that plastic bags are not the main problem and the government needed to make people care more about the environment.
SNT.126430.2252	She received 68 percent of the vote after 96 percent of the ballots were tallied.
SNT.126430.2253	Turnout in the elections was reported at slightly more than fifty percent.
SNT.126430.2254	A candidate must win at least half the vote in order to avoid a run-off election if the turnout is over 50%.
SNT.126430.2255	With voter turnout at less than 50%, a candidate needs at least 33% support from all persons eligible to cast a ballot.
SNT.126430.2256	I congratulate the Lithuanian people for their choice, she said at her election headquarters.
SNT.102543.2257	On March 18, President Kevin Baugh of the Republic of Molossia, a micronation located in Nevada, announced that his country would hold its first ever international summit this June.
SNT.102543.2258	Grand Prince Christopher I and Princess Erin of the Principality of Vikesland, another micronation located in Canada, will be attending.
SNT.102543.2259	Besides the meeting itself, which is scheduled to take place in Molossia's capital city, Espera, President Baugh is to give them a tour of his country as well as the surrounding areas.
SNT.102543.2260	He is looking forward to the event and hopes that it may "open the way to future visits between Molossia and the other small nations of the world."
SNT.102543.2261	The Republic of Molossia and Principality of Vikesland are not recognized by any major countries or international organizations.
SNT.102543.2262	Earlier this month, Wikinews held an interview with President Baugh.
SNT.7622.2263	Bill Clinton, the former President of the United States of America, will make a visit to Romania on May 21, to participate as the keynote speaker at the BeyondBorders 2005 conference in Bucharest.
SNT.7622.2264	The conference will have the theme of "Branding a Country: Building a Reputation from Within" and is the inaugural BeyondBorders conference launched by the Brand Academy, the first Romanian institution dedicated to brand education.
SNT.7622.2265	Clinton's previous visit to Romania was July 11, 1997, when he visited the country to promote political and military integration around the time of the NATO Summit.
SNT.7622.2266	He was the first US president to visit Romania since the Romanian Revolution of 1989 that overthrew the Communist regime.
SNT.7622.2267	The BeyondBorders 2005 conference will focus on strategies to brand Romania and promote it to the world.
SNT.7622.2268	In recent years, Romania has realised the need for branding and for improving its image in the world in order to fuel prosperity.
SNT.7622.2269	Branding would focus on building a reputation a positive reputation for the country abroad and emphasising its authentic values.
SNT.7622.2270	The conference organisers hope that it will act as a springboard for an integrated national branding project for Romania.
SNT.761179.2271	Australian Capital Territory — Thousands of Canberrans took a look at the new Cotter Dam on the Cotter River on open day on Sunday.
SNT.761179.2272	The public was given limited access to the still-active construction site.
SNT.761179.2273	Buses took viewers from the car park below to top of the dam wall.
SNT.761179.2274	They ran every 15 minutes from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm.
SNT.761179.2275	The dam is to supply fresh water to the city of Canberra.
SNT.761179.2276	This is to provide water security for the city as droughts become more frequent due to global warming.
SNT.761179.2277	It is a gravity dam, which holds back the waters through sheer mass.
SNT.761179.2278	In addition to the main dam, there are two saddle dams filling depressions in the landscape so flood waters flow over the spillway and not out the sides of the lake.
SNT.761179.2279	The dam on the Cotter River has been under construction for four years.
SNT.761179.2280	These are to be replanted to replace the native flora.
SNT.761179.2281	The dam replaces an old dam, first built in 1911 but subsequently expanded several times.
SNT.761179.2282	Now heritage listed, it has been submerged by the waters of the new dam.
SNT.761179.2283	Some materials were salvaged from the old dam to build the new, and some have been put on display.
SNT.761179.2284	The river is named after Garrett Cotter, an Irish-born convict who was transported to Australia and lived in the area in the 1830s and 1840s.
SNT.109347.2285	The Philippine shipping company Sulpicio Lines has asked a court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) stopping the Board of Marine Inquiry (BMI) from proceeding with its investigation into the loss of MV Princess of the Stars.
SNT.109347.2286	The passenger ferry capsised and sank off Sibuyan island on June 21 during Typhoon Fengshen (known locally as Typhhon Frank) with hundreds of casualties.
SNT.109347.2287	Sulpicio told the Manila Regional Trial Court that both Republic Act 9295 and the Domestic Shipping Development Act of 2004 removed the BMI's power to investigate maritime incidents and that the investigation the board launched on June 25 is "irregular, illegal, and null and void".
SNT.109347.2288	They say only the Maritime Industry Authority is allowed to investigate accidents at sea.
SNT.109347.2289	Sulpicio also described the investigation as an 'inquisition' that was biased against Sulpicio from the start.
SNT.109347.2290	They say "prejudgment" has increased the "pervasive negative publicity" surrounding the line, since negative accusations are most often published in newspapers.
SNT.109347.2291	The company says one comment the board made was "Your vessel is not stable!" "You have no business being a safety officer!"
SNT.109347.2292	As a result Sulpicio is seeking ₱650,000 from the BMI.
SNT.109347.2293	This is split down as ₱500,000 in moral damages, ₱100,000 lawyer's fees and ₱50,000 further costs.
SNT.109347.2294	The House Committee on Transportation also launched its own inquiry into the disaster today.
SNT.88221.2295	Heavy rains in Indonesia yesterday triggered widespread flooding and landslides across the nation.
SNT.88221.2296	It has emerged that last night a bridge was swept away by the swollen river it stretched across, leaving around 40 to 50 people missing in Madiun, East Java.
SNT.88221.2297	Meanwhile, the total toll of those known or feared to be dead has reached 130.
SNT.88221.2298	According to local police chief Supardi in a telephone conversation with Xinhua the flood waters weakened a foundation, resulting in the collapse.
SNT.88221.2299	At least twenty motorcyclists, car drivers and passengers are thought to be dead, but as of midnight, no bodies had been recovered.
SNT.88221.2300	Continuing heavy rain forced the search to be abandoned temporarily.
SNT.88221.2301	Java as a whole is the worst affected island; in addition to the bridge collapse most of the landslides occurred in two Central Java districts.
SNT.88221.2302	Health ministry official Rustam Pakaya told reporters that at least 28,000 people have been forced to abandon their homes in central Java, although exact figures are not yet available.
SNT.88221.2303	The Red Cross commented that 45,000 East Javanese people have been similarly displaced.
SNT.88221.2304	Thousands are seeking shelter in mosques and other public buildings.
SNT.88221.2305	Landslides buried houses and made roads impassable, while hundreds police officers, military personnel, local officials and volunteers have been digging with farm tools and even their hands to search for survivors.
SNT.88221.2306	Heavy machinery is available but the road conditions have prevented it arriving at the areas where it is required.
SNT.88221.2307	Jakarta has dispatched aid in the form of five tonnes of biscuits and instant meals, ten tonnes of baby food and multiple boats.
SNT.88221.2308	This brings the total confirmed death toll in the area to 48.
SNT.88221.2309	He said that most bodies were recovered from three metre deep mud and required heavy digging machinery to retrieve.
SNT.88221.2310	Local resident Siswo told AFP "Suddenly I felt my house shaking, and I thought it was an earthquake."
SNT.88221.2311	"When I got outside, I saw that the houses next to mine were already covered by earth," and that it struck twelve neighbouring houses.
SNT.88221.2312	In the next district, Wonogiri, disaster management centre head Sri Mubadi told reporters they had retrieved two more bodies, reaching a total of six, with eleven more missing.
SNT.88221.2313	He also confirmed that they currently have no access to heavy equipment.
SNT.88221.2314	In Tawangmangu about 1,000 rescuers were also searching for bodies and survivors without the aid of heavy machinery.
SNT.88221.2315	Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir toured a Karanganyar village, at which time he commented that he felt the disaster had been caused as a form of divine revenge, saying "This was likely caused by immoral acts going on here," and "This could be a lesson to be learned."
SNT.88221.2316	The 69-year-old served two years after being linked to the 2002 Bali bombings, before having his conviction overturned last year.
SNT.88221.2317	For five consecutive years landslides and floods have occurred in Java, claiming many lives. 
SNT.88221.2318	 The main trigger is ecological destruction caused by deforestation, forest conversions and chaotic spatial planning, Chalid told Reuters.
SNT.88221.2319	There have been no adequate efforts by the government to protect the people from disasters. 
SNT.88221.2320	 When the landslides happened officials were on holiday and there was no access of heavy equipment to the affected areas.
SNT.86310.2321	Roughly 600 enraged Sudanese protesters, some armed with knives and sticks, converged on Khartoum's Martyrs' Square after Friday Prayers to demand the death of Gillian Gibbons, the British teacher jailed yesterday for allowing her class of 7-year-olds to name a teddy bear Mohammad, one of the most common names in the Arab world.
SNT.86310.2322	A number of prominent Sudanese clerics ignored government instructions not to inflame the situation, although they stopped short of directly calling for her death.
SNT.86310.2323	By the end of Friday Prayers passions were running high.
SNT.86310.2324	Sheikh Hussein Mubarak told thousands of the faithful gathered for the Muslim day of prayer that the court's "verdict was lenient out of fear of criticism from human rights organisations, America and the West", and he denounced "those who try to defend democracy and human rights and insult the Prophet."
SNT.86310.2325	He claimed Ms Gibbons was part of a campaign to transform Sudan from an Islamic state into a Christian state.
SNT.86310.2326	Imprisoning this lady does not satisfy the thirst of Muslims in Sudan. 
SNT.86310.2327	 Leaflets distributed earlier in the week by Sudanese Muslim groups had condemned Gibbons as an infidel" and accused her of "the pollution of children's mentality".
SNT.86310.2328	They promised a "popular release of anger" at demonstrations on Friday.
SNT.86310.2329	An angry crowd of around 600 protesters - some reports say thousands - gathered at Martyrs' Square, outside the presidential palace.
SNT.86310.2330	The mob chanted slogans like, "those who insult the Prophet of Islam should be punished with bullets", "No tolerance: Execution," "Kill her, kill her by firing squad," and "Shame, shame on the UK."
SNT.86310.2331	Newspaper pictures of Ms Gibbons were set on fire, and foreign journalists were threatened, and forced to leave.
SNT.86310.2332	Hundreds of riot police were deployed but they did not break up the demonstration.
SNT.86310.2333	Britain's Foreign Office is understood to be arranging further talks with the Sudanese government today.
SNT.86310.2334	Boris Johnson, an English MP writing in The Times in London, has welcomed Muslim opposition in Britain to the events in Sudan and called for muslims to publicly demonstrate their outrage: : "the voices we need to hear now belong to Britain's vast, sensible Muslim majority..."
SNT.86310.2335	"Their arguments will be heard with respect in Khartoum, since they cannot be said to be founded on any kind of cultural imperialism, or to be actuated by Islamophobia."
SNT.86310.2336	: "More importantly, a strong protest by British Muslims against the imprisonment of Gillian Gibbons would help to contradict the growing ranks of pessimists and neo-cons - the people who say that the real problem is Islam, the religion itself."
SNT.86310.2337	Ms Gibbons' son John, from Liverpool, has asked that British people angered by his mother's jail sentence should not turn against Muslims.
SNT.86310.2338	: "We have had a lot of support from Muslims in Britain, in Sudan and across the world…"
SNT.86310.2339	"I do not want this to lead to any anti-Muslims feeling in this country."
SNT.74298.2340	The Young Earth Creationist who sent threatening emails and letters to biologists at the University of Colorado at Boulder also sent threatening letters to the University chancellor G.P. Peterson as well as the vice-chancellor of undergraduate education and others.
SNT.74298.2341	The man who had sent the threats has been identified as Menachem "Michael" Korn, a former Orthodox Jew who converted to Messianic Judaism (no longer affiliated with either) and who now self-identifies as "Christian".
SNT.74298.2342	Claimed excerpts of the threats were posted on The Panda's Thumb, a biology blog that focuses on "the claims of the anti-evolution movement."
SNT.74298.2343	Among other statements, Korn compared evolutionary biologists to child molesters and discussed killing the "enemies of Christian society" who are "terrorists against America".
SNT.74298.2344	A spokesperson for Colorado University said that the excerpts were "consistent" with the threats but refused to confirm if they were actual excerpts.
SNT.74298.2345	Korn had apparently distributed fliers on campus before and harassed professors but over the last few days the threats had become more extreme.
SNT.509864.2346	News of his death was shared with Wikinews through the Australian Tax Office and Tony Naar of the Australian Paralympic Committee.
SNT.509864.2347	French, who lived in Penrith, New South Wales, was one of fifteen athletes to compete at Australia's second Paralympic Games in 1964 in Tokyo when he won a silver medal in the men's 25 metre freestyle event.
SNT.509864.2348	It was the only medal he earned at the Games and one of 30 Australia earned that year.
SNT.509864.2349	In 2000, his medal was displayed at the Our Sporting Heritage exhibition at the Arms of Australia Inn Museum.
SNT.509864.2350	His legacy of participation can be seen in the upcoming 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.
SNT.509864.2351	Australia are sending 161 athletes to the Paralympics this year.
SNT.509864.2352	The Paralympic team is expected to finish the Games having earned the country's one thousandth medal.
SNT.77453.2353	An 11-year-old boy has died after being shot in the car park of the Fir Tree pub in the Croxteth area of Liverpool, shortly after 1930 BST.
SNT.77453.2354	An eyewitness, who had been drinking outside the pub at the time, said the boy was one of three playing football in the car park when a teenager, believed to be male, on a BMX bicycle fired three shots at the group from approximately 30 metres away, one hitting the victim in the neck.
SNT.77453.2355	The other shots missed the boys, one hitting a car.
SNT.77453.2356	The boy's mother was called to the scene as people came out of the pub to help him.
SNT.77453.2357	A spokesman for North West Ambulance Service said: "We treated an 11-year-old with serious gunshot wounds."
SNT.77453.2358	He added the boy was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, but police later confirmed he had died.
SNT.77453.2359	Officers have sealed off the scene, including a neighbouring street of shops.
SNT.77453.2360	There have currently been no arrests in connection with the shooting.
SNT.77453.2361	In an appeal to the local community to help catch the killer, Merseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Simon Byrne said: "Someone out there knows who put the gun in his hand and I want your help to get the community to turn that gunman in tonight."
SNT.77453.2362	"This is quite an awful crime, quite senseless, and the community holds the clue to solving this crime quickly."
SNT.77453.2363	"You can only imagine the heartache of the family that's been ripped apart."
SNT.77453.2364	Local councillor Rose Bailey, who lives nearby, also appealed for people with information to come forward, saying: "It sends shockwaves through the community of Croxteth and really it must be devastating."
SNT.77453.2365	"To think your young son is out playing football and then to get a call to say he's been shot, I really don't know as a parent how you would handle that."
SNT.77453.2366	The area around the pub was made a "designated area" by police last year, meaning officers could disperse groups and move people away from the area.
SNT.77453.2367	The incident is another in a growing list of shootings of minors, many gang-related, in the UK's major cities in 2007.
SNT.41031.2368	Today the New Zealand Finance Minister, Hon. Dr Michael Cullen, presented the 2006 New Zealand Budget to the House of Representatives.
SNT.41031.2369	There is a NZ$8.5 billion OBERAC surplus and a NZ$1.5 billion cash surplus.
SNT.41031.2370	It has been labelled as the "Bondi Budget" by National leader Don Brash, "Helen Clark and Michael Cullen believe there is a place for tax cuts - it's called Australia" he said.
SNT.41031.2371	The budget allocates new operating spending of $9.6 billion and capital of $2.7 billion over the next four years.
SNT.72855.2372	West Indies have beaten England by 15 runs in the first Twenty20 international of their tour of England at The Oval, London, England.
SNT.72855.2373	The West Indian innings started off badly by losing Gayle early, however they turned their fortunes around with some attacking and aggressive cricket and posted a huge total of 208.
SNT.72855.2374	A bigger total could have been posted if it had not been for a late innings batting collapse.
SNT.72855.2375	England started their reply by getting off to a flyer, but lost some early wickets that slowed down the run-rate.
SNT.72855.2376	Leading the charge was Paul Collingwood with a fast 79 with 5 4's and 4 6's.
SNT.72855.2377	Had they not have lost the early wickets, England would have probably won the match to take a 1-0 lead in the series.
SNT.72855.2378	Instead, it is West Indies that have taken a 1-0 lead in the series.
SNT.108527.2379	An Australian air safety group claims that Yogyakarta International Airport was opearating illegally with no license when Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, a Boeing 737, crashed at the airport, killing 16 Indonesians and five Australians.
SNT.108527.2380	Flight Safety Pty Ltd had been asked to carry out an independent investigation by an anonymous client after the March 2007 disaster, which occurred when the aircraft landed at excessive speed and shot off the end of the runway.
SNT.108527.2381	Flight Safety has now announced that they have found Yogyakarta International had been granted a five year license but this would be withdrawn after twelve months if several conditions were not met.
SNT.108527.2382	Since these conditions remained unchanged, the license effectively voided six months before the disaster, claim Flight Safety.
SNT.108527.2383	One of the conditions was extension of the runway and provision of an adequate Runway End Safety Area (RESA).
SNT.108527.2384	The group adds that it also conducted checks on Solo International Airport and Semarang International Airport, and that these airports also had invalid Airport Operating Certificates.
SNT.108527.2385	The final report was not released at the time as the client in question felt it 'too sensitive', and Flight Safety says that it was rapidly covered up three months later when it leaked in Indonesia.
SNT.108527.2386	The group says it notified the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and that they in turn said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) - who assisted in the crash investigation - was in control of the situation.
SNT.108527.2387	However, Flight Safety claim that when approached, the ATSB denied knowing about it.
SNT.108527.2388	Allegedly, the ATSB had missed the licensing discrepancy because they only checked the front page of the airport's license and did not conduct a detailed analysis of the small print.
SNT.108527.2389	Flight Safety claim that the Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety told them that the situation had been rectified.
SNT.108527.2390	However, the group have now conducted a re-audit and say Solo and Yogyakarta airports both remain illegal.
SNT.108527.2391	They go on to accuse the ICAO, ATSB and Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety of "keeping quiet" and described them as 'compromised'.
SNT.108527.2392	Flight Safety go on to claim that the survivors of the crash and relatives of the deceased have not been informed either, and say that this will have a serious effect on the compensation process and on any insurance claims.
SNT.108527.2393	Crikey, an Australian news service, also suggested that AU$12 million of aid promised by Australia to help Indonesia improve air safety is also being misused.
SNT.108527.2394	All Indonesia's air carriers are currently on the list of air carriers banned in the EU.
SNT.108527.2395	An official statement by Flight Safety head Chris Weir concluded "It [the group's findings] should now be exposed as the safety issues remain unresolved."
SNT.108527.2396	Mardjono Siswo Suwarno of the National Transport Safety Committee, the body responsible for investigating the disaster, denied that Yogyakarta Airport was illegal, saying "At that time [the license] was still valid, but the RESA was not long enough…"
SNT.108527.2397	"But still in the [Garuda] case, even if the RESA length was adequate, the plane would have still overrun because the speed was 1.8 times normal speed."
SNT.108527.2398	The final report found that the pilot-in-command, who has been arrested and charged over the crash, attempted to land after fifteen Ground Proximity Warning System activations to tell him he was landing too fast, and says that although a longer runway and full-sized RESA wouldn't have stopped an airliner traveling at such excessive speed it could have reduced the toll of deaths and injuries.
SNT.108527.2399	The directors of Yogyakarta and Solo airports claim that since the re-audit they have taken steps to improve safety and rectify any problems, but have not actually admitted their airports were illegal.
SNT.108527.2400	Indonesian director general of air transportation Budi Mulyawan Suyitno said that although local budget limitations have prevented some airports from being improved there are no problems currently at Yogyakarta, with improvements including declaration of a RESA for 140 metres of the 2,250 metre runway and stationing Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting trucks at the airport.
SNT.33671.2401	The prosecutor did not withhold complains for "simple" and "severe" physical harm by negligence against gendarmes Poget and Deiss in the trial of the Aubonne Bridge affair.
SNT.223324.2402	A jawbone found in Aruba is not that of missing American Natalee Holloway, who was a recent high school-graduate at the time of her disappearance.
SNT.223324.2403	Officials confirmed the news after Dutch scientists completed tests on the bone.
SNT.223324.2404	The jawbone, which also had a wisdom tooth with it, was found by an American tourist close to the Phoenix Hotel.
SNT.223324.2405	A second bone had also been found by another tourist earlier this month.
SNT.223324.2406	The bone was sent to the Netherlands Forensic Institute where scientists completed tests.
SNT.223324.2407	They compared the bone to dental records given to them by Natalee's father, from which they confirmed the the bone was not that of Natalee, although it was human.
SNT.223324.2408	It was said to be unlikely that the bone was Holloway's as there is no physical evidence that she was murdered.
SNT.223324.2409	Taco Stein, the Aruban Solicitor General, released a statement after the announcement was made.
SNT.223324.2410	He commented on the speed of the identification; he said that they had quickly ruled out Holloway because her records had shown that she had her wisdom teeth previously removed.
SNT.96411.2411	Last week, Naked News announced that it would dramatically increase its international language mandate to news reporting, with three new broadcasts.
SNT.96411.2412	Already reporting in English and Japanese, the global organization is launching Spanish, Italian, and Korean-language programs, for television, the web, and mobile devices.
SNT.96411.2413	Wikinews interviewed one of the English broadcast's anchors a little while ago, about the program.
SNT.96411.2414	The broadcasts feature daily news and human interest pieces, presented by an anchor who gradually removes their clothing.
SNT.96411.2415	The internationally-focused newscast created a stir upon its launch in 1999, but has since expanded with online viewers in 172 nations.
SNT.96411.2416	Naked News President David Warga commented in a press release that "our intention at Naked News is to be a global media source, much like CNN or BBC World."
SNT.96411.2417	"We are looking forward to expanding into other languages as well, because there is definitely a market demanding our brand of infotainment."
SNT.96411.2418	Unlike the foreign stations run by the BBC or CNN, the international broadcasts will not be produced by the company.
SNT.96411.2419	Branding and practices will be licensed to the other production and distribution companies.
SNT.96411.2420	Warga claims that, instead of presenting the naked female form as "fluff-head bimbos", their news organization "encourages society to see women as being smart, powerful, and sophisticated."
SNT.96411.2421	Despite this, the press release lists hotel rooms as being one of the primary distribution methods; hotels account for a large segment of the pornography industry's broadcast market.
SNT.630979.2422	The Islamic Republic of Iran says it is conducting naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz.
SNT.630979.2423	According to the Iranian navy's Habibollah Sayyari, the "Velayat 91" drills — to be held for a six day period ending on Wednesday — are intended to showcase "the armed forces' military capabilities."
SNT.630979.2424	Iran's state-run media reports that the Iranian government warns all ships to stay away until the end of the exercises.
SNT.630979.2425	According to this report the drills — which began on Friday — are to be conducted over roughly half a million square miles (a million square kilometers) of waters stretching from the Strait of Hormuz to the northern part of the Indian Ocean which includes the Gulf of Oman.
SNT.630979.2426	The Strait of Hormuz is a major shipping route of great strategic importance.
SNT.630979.2427	According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 17 million barrels of oil passes through this part of the Persian Gulf per day.
SNT.630979.2428	That is nearly 20% of the worldwide oil trade and about 35% of oil transported by sea.
SNT.630979.2429	This is only one in a series of major naval drills held by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz.
SNT.630979.2430	Ten days of drills, "Velayat 90", was conducted last December and "Velayat 89" a year and a half before that in May 2010.
SNT.630979.2431	Four months ago, the United States with some of its allies also conducted a series of exercises and naval drills, concerned with keeping the strait open.
SNT.630979.2432	Iran has said it might close the strait if its nuclear program were attacked.
SNT.252465.2433	South Africa crashed out of the 2011 Cricket World Cup after being beaten by New Zealand in the quarterfinals, played at Mirpur, in Bangladesh.
SNT.252465.2434	Chasing a victory target of 222, South Africa were all out for 172 after some inspired bowling performance by Jacob Oram and Nathan McCullum.
SNT.252465.2435	Earlier South Africa restricted the kiwis for 221 for the loss of 8 wickets.
SNT.252465.2436	Afterward, Jesse Ryder top scored for NZ with 83 runs while Ross Taylor scored 43.
SNT.252465.2437	Morne Morkel took three wickets while fast bowler Steyn and Spinner Imran Tahir took two wickets each.
SNT.252465.2438	South Africa collapsed from 121 for three wickets and lost the final seven wickets for 51 runs.
SNT.252465.2439	McCullum, who opened the bowling for NZ, took three wickets while Oram took another four wickets and triggered a collapse.
SNT.252465.2440	NZ will now play either Srilanka or England in the semi-finals.
SNT.139915.2441	Kadyrov did not appear in court but his lawyer, Andrei Krasnenkov, neither called witnesses nor questioned those brought by the defence.
SNT.139915.2442	Krasnenkov said Orlov's words were helping destabilize Chechnya and told reporters that "Human rights defenders are miserable people."
SNT.139915.2443	Estemirova had been threatened several times by Kadyrov and had fled Russia previously as a result, sometimes for months.
SNT.139915.2444	She was, Kadyrov said, "without honour or a sense of shame."
SNT.139915.2445	Memorial say they hope the court case, which gets under way on October 6, will reveal new evidence of serious crimes they claim Kadyrov routinely ignores.
SNT.783991.2446	Early last night, massive attacks targeted China's Internet, slowing access to a crawl.
SNT.783991.2447	The Chinese domain was targeted in the latest of many denial of service attacks against China.
SNT.783991.2448	According to the China Internet Network Information Center, which manages the .cn domain, this attack was the largest of its kind.
SNT.783991.2449	The domain was attacked twice, once at 2am local time, and again at 4am.
SNT.783991.2450	The second was larger, and Chinese officials said work to restore service was progressing slowly.
SNT.783991.2451	State-run newsmedia said numerous .cn websites and microblogging website Sina Weibo were targeted.
SNT.783991.2452	This outage comes at a sensitive time for China, with the trial of , a former government official, having just ended.
SNT.783991.2453	The attack also comes amidst rumors that the Chinese government will be cracking down on social media commentators, according the The Wall Street Journal.
SNT.783991.2454	According to a Wall Street Journal interview with Matthew Prince, CEO of , a company that tracks web traffic and metrics, during the attack Chinese Internet traffic dropped by 32%.
SNT.783991.2455	He also claimed this attack is an indicator of the susceptibility of Chinese Internet infrastructure to these attacks.
SNT.54227.2456	When the host was calling up the Country Music Award Female Vocalist Of The Year award, Faith Hill stood up and was in shock after hearing Carrie Underwood's name.
SNT.54227.2457	What?!, said Faith Hill directly into the camera as her smile turned into a look of shock.
SNT.54227.2458	The idea that I would act disrespectful towards a fellow musician is unimaginable to me, Hill said in a statement.
SNT.54227.2459	For this to become a focus of attention given the talent gathered is utterly ridiculous. 
SNT.54227.2460	Carrie is a talented and deserving female vocalist of the year.
SNT.54227.2461	Underwood, 2005 former American Idol winner, did not take it seriously, according to her publicist, Jessie Schmidt.
SNT.54227.2462	She didn't realize that the camera was rolling the whole time. 
SNT.54227.2463	 She just thought they were doing a shot when they read the nominees off.
SNT.54227.2464	Gary Borman, Hill's manager, said that it was just "a joke".
SNT.54227.2465	Faith Hill had won the Female Vocalist Of The Year award in 2000.
SNT.11420.2466	More than half of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's convoy was prevented from entering Rwanda on Thursday.
SNT.11420.2467	The President was travelling to Kigali to hand over the chairmanship of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to Rwandan president Paul Kagame.
SNT.11420.2468	Rwandan officials have been quoted as saying that the Ugandan convoy violated rules on the number of guns they are allowed to carry across the border.
SNT.11420.2469	Uganda has blamed the incident solely on Rwanda, arguing that the situation could have been resolved with much less controversy.
SNT.11420.2470	What happened at the border was the sole responsibility of the Rwandese officials involved. 
SNT.11420.2471	 If there had been extra guns, why could they not be left on the border for later collection and allow the vehicles to continue? said a statement from Uganda's foreign ministry.
SNT.11420.2472	The guns could even have been returned to Uganda, it is only 200 meters away. 
SNT.11420.2473	 The body guards normally travel with guns even in commercial airlines. 
SNT.11420.2474	 They, then, give them to you on arrival, it added.
SNT.11420.2475	The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, is a free trade area stretching from Egypt to Namibia.
SNT.11420.2476	Relations between Uganda and Rwanda have been improving over the last few years, however recently the situation has deteriorated.
SNT.83340.2477	Oil has risen to a new all-time record high during trading in Asia, passing US$91.10 at 10:23 p.m. on October 25 (eastern time).
SNT.83340.2478	In electronic trading at the NYMEX Crude Futures in the United States touched a record price of, at US$92.22, according to Bloomberg, setting another record all-time high.
SNT.83340.2479	On the IntercontinentalExchange Brent Crude futures reached US$89.30 (basis December) as of 8:34 a.m..
SNT.83340.2480	NYMEX Crude closed at $91.86, while ICE Brent closed at $88.69, at the conclusion of Friday's trading.
SNT.83340.2481	The raise come when the United States announced that it had an "unexpected loss" in the nation's stockpile of oil.
SNT.83340.2482	The fear that Turkey may launch a large scale attack on Kurdish Militants inside Iraq is also being blamed for the raise in prices and the U.S. imposed more sanctions on Iran for continuing to enrich uranium.
SNT.83340.2483	Australia's Commonwealth Banks states that the raise is "being supported by an increase in geopolitical tensions and also market developments."
SNT.83340.2484	"The US has announced that it is imposing new sanctions on Iran, Oil markets also continued to have an eye on developments related to the current tensions between Turkey and Kurd rebels in Iraq."
SNT.83340.2485	OPEC has agreed that by November 1, 2007, they will increase the amount of barrels of oil they produce by 500,000 barrels a day.
SNT.83340.2486	The U.S. says that they would like that number increased.
SNT.62405.2487	Just two weeks after China sent global markets into a tumble, growing worries about sub-prime mortgage lenders in the United States are sending jitters through stock exchanges around the globe.
SNT.62405.2488	The three major US stock market indices each fell two percent from Monday's closing price, marking the second-biggest loss of 2007.
SNT.62405.2489	London's FTSE 100, Paris' CAC 40 and Frankfurt's DAX 30 indices each closed down more than 1 percent.
SNT.62405.2490	As the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that late payments on mortgages and home foreclosures in the US homes rose in the fourth quarter to their highest level in years, investors are concerned that not only US banks but also multi-national banks around the globe could have exposure.
SNT.62405.2491	More than two dozen sub-prime lenders have closed or sold operations as defaults on those mortgages have risen.
SNT.62405.2492	The delinquencies and defaults have started to soar, said Nicolas Retsinas, director of Housing Studies at Harvard University.
SNT.62405.2493	A lot of these lenders started to make loans and lost track of some of the fundamentals.
SNT.62405.2494	New Century Financial Corporation, the second largest sub-prime lender in the US, has recently revealed that its creditors were no longer providing funds and, further, it has become subject of an SEC investigation.
SNT.62405.2495	The New York Stock Exchange has said it will delist New Century.
SNT.62405.2496	Accredited Home Loan Lending, another major sub-prime mortgage specialist, said it was seeking fresh capital and waivers on its lending covenants.
SNT.62405.2497	Sub-prime lenders provide mortgages to people who do not qualify for loans from mainstream lenders, typically due to their credit histories.
SNT.62405.2498	The lenders then bundle these mortgages as collateral for loans that they obtain from other financing firms, such as GMAC.
SNT.62405.2499	Such firms can then repackage these loans and sell them as mortgage-backed securities.
SNT.62405.2500	These securities may end up in the hands of major multi-national banks such as Citibank, HSBC, and Commerzbank.
SNT.62405.2501	Each level of lending assumes a level of financial risk, but trouble can arise when the risk tolerances are exceeded.
SNT.62405.2502	If too many homeowners default on their mortgages, the sub-prime lender can end up defaulting.
SNT.62405.2503	If too many of these lenders default, as it is feared may be happening now, the defaults can cascade upward.
SNT.62405.2504	While no one is predicting major bank failures at this point, it is feared that their profits could be hurt.

SNT.15108.2534	Hurricane Emily has hit the small eastern Caribbean island of Grenada.
SNT.15108.2535	The hurricane, which has been upgraded to Category 2 status, hit the island early this morning and has caused widespread damage.

SNT.102156.2545	A 72-golden-hour race of 2008 Tour de Taiwan in the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area came to an end after entering the Taipei Xinyi Shopping Area as the final stage today.
SNT.102156.2546	Before the main race, the organizer, Chinese Taipei Cycling Association held "The 3rd Taipei Citizen Elimination Road Race" to examine the achievements of basic cycling promotion.
SNT.102156.2547	Even though its racing scale is one third of the Taipei Stage (60 laps, 1 km/lap), but several local cycling clubs and senior cyclists participated in this promotional race.
SNT.102156.2548	Kuan-hua Lai, a cyclist from Giant Asia Racing Team, the current Taiwan leader of Tour de Taiwan, spoke to Wikinews Reporter Rico Shen before racing: "Since we [the Team] took the leading from Changhua County Stage until now, we were still be cautious of this current status because the competitors just lost behind within 15 seconds."
SNT.102156.2549	And also, he commented about an "earlier suspension" incident in the same stage in 2007: "I didn't participate in this series last year."
SNT.102156.2550	"However, with several cyclists' actual strengths in several criterium stages, I think that the same incident won't take place again this year."
SNT.102156.2551	In the main race, due to a very close actual strength, not everyone can took the leading for a long-period especially in Asian cyclists' competition.
SNT.102156.2552	As a result in the middle-end section, the main group extremity controlled the condition of this race.
SNT.102156.2553	Finally, Marek Wesoły from Merida Europe Team won his second stage champion in this stage since he got former stage champion in Pingtung County.

SNT.102156.2556	After the race, He commented about this race: "Even though we got a great difference after we [the Team] got the lead from Changhua [stage], but we got a damn difficult situation because the competitors just lost behind within a small difference."
SNT.102156.2557	"Because of this issue, we cautiously chose some roads to do several attacks to keep the leading to the end."
SNT.102156.2558	After this, my current teammates did several attempts covering me to the end, and finally, it took a good effort for me.
SNT.7710.2559	April 9, 2005 A rise in flesh-eating staph infections has worried doctors about the possible spread of drug resistant bacteria.
SNT.7710.2560	Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as staph, is a bacteria that commonly causes skin infections in otherwise healthy people.
SNT.7710.2561	However, as a persistent threat in hospitals, it tends to infect patients who are already sick and whose systems are vulnerable due to IV lines that pierce the skin.
SNT.7710.2562	Doctors have already battled for years against drug-resistant strains of the bacteria, but the struggle has generally been confined to hospitals.
SNT.7710.2563	Now, however, Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) has been spreading in communities outside hospitals.
SNT.7710.2564	Cases have multiplied by 25 times since 1998 at the University of Chicago.
SNT.7710.2565	A Los Angeles hospital documented 14 cases of the flesh-eating infection, where patients required substantial time in intensive care and surgery.
SNT.7710.2566	The infections are particularly problematic because nearly a quarter of people who get a staph infection require hospitalization.
SNT.7710.2567	Staph infections are spread much like other diseases, with crowded conditions, poor hygiene, and skin-to-skin contact most frequently to blame.
SNT.7710.2568	At higher risk are prison inmates, homeless people, military personnel, and families with kids in day care.
SNT.7710.2569	Athletes also have a higher risk, because sweating makes it easier for bacteria to infect the skin.
SNT.169599.2570	An overnight explosion and fire at a Washington State oil refinery in Anacortes, Washington, United States, a city about 80 miles south of Vancouver, Canada, yesterday killed four people and critically injured three others.
SNT.169599.2571	A Tesoro Corp. refinery caught fire at about 0030 local time (0830 GMT) while maintenance work was being performed in preparation for returning a part of the plant to operation in a dangerous procedure involving increasing heat and pressure in the unit involved.
SNT.169599.2572	Some people reportedly felt the explosion, which sent flames as high as the tower in the refinery, from as far as five miles away.
SNT.169599.2573	The fire, whose cause is not yet known, burned for around an hour and a half before being extinguished.
SNT.169599.2574	Initially, Tesoro announced that three people had died in the fire.
SNT.169599.2575	According to a spokesperson from Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, a fourth person, a 29-year-old woman, later died from her injuries at the hospital, while three other people, a woman and two men, all remain in critical condition with major burns.
SNT.169599.2576	Three of the dead were named as Matthew Bowen, Darren Hoines and Daniel Aldridge, while the person who died in the hospital has not been identified.
SNT.169599.2577	According to CNN, three workers are still missing, and a search has begun for them.
SNT.169599.2578	The incident was the first fire at an oil refinery in Anacortes since 2007, when a fire at the Shell Puget Sound Refinery damaged a storage, resulting in three minor injuries.
SNT.169599.2579	A Tesoro-owned refinery was involved in another fire in 2002, also with no reported injuries.
SNT.52162.2580	Recently Canadian MP Belinda Stronach had an affair with Tie Domi, a former NHL player.
SNT.52162.2581	She had refused to answer direct questions about her personal life.
SNT.52162.2582	Now for the first time since her affair, with Tie Domi, she sat down with CBC's George Stroumboulopoulos on his show The Hour to answer his questions about the affair, politics, and other topics during the nine minute chat, on October 9th.
SNT.52162.2583	No transcripts of this interview are officially available but, a video (see CBC source below) can be viewed.
SNT.8528.2584	The 15-year-old Australian boy charged on Sunday night related to the alleged theft of a Tram, faces another nine charges over prior incidents, bringing the total to 18 charges.
SNT.8528.2585	The new allegations relate to theft of a bus, attempted theft of a train, and another incident with a tram.
SNT.8528.2586	On Monday he was also charged over an incident, in which a tram was allegedly stolen from Southbank on Friday.
SNT.8528.2587	The boy was arrested yesterday at his Sunshine home and bailed to appear in Melbourne Children's Court in June, over the nine new charges.
SNT.8528.2588	On Monday, Yarra Trams spokesperson Colin Tyrus told The Age that there had been "a mystery collision in the depot on April 10".
SNT.8528.2589	After what happened on Sunday we obviously reported all of that to the police and we are continuing to assist them with their inquiries, Mr Tyrus said.
SNT.8528.2590	Police allege he drove a vehicle in the Southbank yard and hit another tram, on April 10, causing $2000 damage.
SNT.8528.2591	And on April 9, it is alleged, he jumped a fence at a Footscray bus depot, found some keys and drove a bus around the yard.
SNT.8528.2592	Later, it is believed he tried unsuccessfully to start a diesel train at a rail yard in North Melbourne, and then absconded carrying the keys.
SNT.117294.2593	Police forces in India have ended the hostage sieges which followed the Mumbai attacks, which began on Wednesday in Mumbai, the financial capital of India.
SNT.117294.2594	It ended when commandos finally caught up with a lone gunman, who had played a cat-and-mouse game in the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, nearly 56 hours after the attacks began.
SNT.117294.2595	According to Indian television and radio, 155 people have been killed and 327 others wounded.
SNT.117294.2596	Police say that they are in control of both the Taj Mahal and Oberoi Trident hotels.
SNT.117294.2597	These people were very, very familiar with the hotel layouts and it appears they had carried out a survey before, said an unidentified commander of MARCOS, India's elite marine commandos.
SNT.117294.2598	The commandos were hampered because they feared injuring hotel guests if they used overwhelming force.
SNT.117294.2599	Bodies were strewn all over the place, and there was blood everywhere, he said.
SNT.117294.2600	The commander also noted that his unit found a backpack belonging to one of the gunmen.
SNT.117294.2601	Inside they found dried fruit, 400 rounds of AK-47 ammunition, four grenades, Indian rupees and American dollars, and seven credit cards from some of the world’s leading banks and a national ID card for the island nation of Mauritius.
SNT.117294.2602	Once the bodies are collected, the number of deaths might go up to 200, said India's Minister of Home Affairs Sri Prakash Jaiswal.
SNT.117294.2603	We came up against highly motivated terrorists, said Vice-Admiral J.S.
SNT.117294.2604	India's foreign minister, Pranab Mukherjee, said, "Preliminary evidence indicates that elements with links to Pakistan are involved," stirring a diplomatic row between India and Pakistan.
SNT.117294.2605	Observers have said that the attacks bear the hallmarks of Lashkar-e-Toiba or Jaish-e-Mohammed, both of which are believed to be based in Pakistan and also responsible for previous attacks on India.
SNT.117294.2606	However, Prime Minister of Pakistan Yousaf Raza Gillani said that Pakistan had "nothing to do with the attacks."
SNT.117294.2607	It is unfair to blame Pakistan or Pakistanis for these acts of terrorism even before an investigation is undertaken, Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement.
SNT.117294.2608	Instead of scoring political points at the expense of a neighboring country that is itself a victim of terrorism, it is time for India's leaders to work together with Pakistan's elected leaders in putting up a joint front against terrorism.
SNT.782905.2609	Thursday at Madrid–Barajas Airport, Wikinews interviewed Spanish Paralympic swimmer Marta Gomez, who is scheduled to compete at the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships that start on Monday in Montreal, Canada.
SNT.782905.2610	This is Laura Hale, I'm interviewing Marta Gómez, a Spanish Paralympic swimmer going to the 2013 IPC Swimming World Championships in Montreal.
SNT.782905.2611	Are you going to Montreal and what strokes and distances are you competing in?
SNT.517748.2612	Following Hungary's release and repatriation of convicted Azeri axe-murderer Ramil Safarov, who Azerbaijan subsequently pardoned, Armenia announced it is "ready for war".
SNT.517748.2613	The declaration is in-response to Safarov's pardon and promotion, despite the Azeri officer having been given a life sentence — with a minimum jail term of 30 years, by Hungarian authorities in 2006.
SNT.517748.2614	Safarov was found guilty of the 2004 murder of Armenian officer Gurgen Margaryan in Budapest, when both Safarov and Margaryan were attending a NATO Partnership for Peace programme.
SNT.517748.2615	Safarov killed Margaryan in his sleep with an axe; the attack allegedly stemming from a desire to avenge Azeris killed during the Nagorno-Karabakh War and being mocked by Margaryan and another Armenian.
SNT.517748.2616	On his return home, Safarov was met with a hero's welcome, given a pardon by president Ilham Aliyev, promoted to the rank of major, awarded eight-years of back-pay and given a house.
SNT.517748.2617	Armenia sees these acts, when it was expected that Safarov would serve out his prison term in Azerbaijan, as highly provocative.
SNT.517748.2618	Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian declared: "We don't want a war, but if we have to, we will fight and win."
SNT.517748.2619	"We are not afraid of killers, even if they enjoy the protection of the head of state" .
SNT.517748.2620	Historically both Armenia and Azerbaijan lay claim to some of the same territories, an issue complicated by the intermingling of ethnic populations so some areas have no clearly demarcated Azeri and Armenian border; these potential sources of conflict remained quiescent whilst both nations were subsumed by greater powers.
SNT.517748.2621	However, the collapse of the Ottoman and Russian Empires in the wake of the First World War led to the Armenian–Azerbaijani War.
SNT.517748.2622	With the demise of the short-lived Armenian-Azerbaijan-Georgia Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, fighting broke out which only ended when the two nations were annexed by the expanding Soviet Union.
SNT.517748.2623	With the USSR's collapse, Armenia and Azerbaijan re-emerged as independent states — as-did old rivalries over territory.
SNT.517748.2624	Between 1988 and 1994 over thirty thousand people died, and a million were displaced in bitter ethnic fighting between Armenians and Azeris over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh; despite an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe brokered ceasefire, no final armistice has been signed and intermittent violence between them the two states continues.
SNT.517748.2625	Nagorno-Karabakh remains legally part of Azerbaijan, but under effective Armenian control.
SNT.517748.2626	On multiple occasions president Ilham Aliyev has stated his willingness to resort to force in order to assert Azeri rule, with oil wealth tipping any local arms race in favour of Azerbaijan.
SNT.517748.2627	On Friday, The National Security Council of Armenia decided to break ties with Hungary during an emergency summit, describing the Hungarian actions as a "grave mistake".
SNT.517748.2628	In turn, the Azeri ambassador was summoned by Hungary on Monday regarding the breach of Azeri assurances that Safarov would serve out the remainder of his sentence in Azerbaijan.
SNT.108657.2629	The camp of Manny Pacquiao led by manager Freddie Roach claimed that Diaz will need a "fucking miracle" to stop 'The Pacman' from moving up to the 135 lbs. weight class where Diaz is top brass.
SNT.108657.2630	The side of Diaz led by Jim Strickland warned that tough Pacquiao has three belts in boxing, Diaz should not be discounted.
SNT.108657.2631	Boxing punters observed that Diaz has a lot of heft in the way he delivers his punches but Pacquiao's speed and strong punches are something Diaz should be wary about.
SNT.108657.2632	Pacquiao has won three different belts in three different weight classes of the World Boxing Council or WBC.
SNT.108657.2633	Diaz debuted in the boxing world when he was part of the winning United States Olympic boxing team during the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games.
SNT.108657.2634	The 32-year-old native of Chicago claimed the 135 lbs. title from Mexican Érik Morales and plans to defend it a third time against the Philippines' prize fighter.
SNT.108657.2635	Meanwhile, Pacquiao dedicated his bout against Diaz to all the victims of Typhoon Fengshen which devastated his home country, the Philippines, and killed hundreds of people.
SNT.3336.2636	Bucharest, the capital of Romania, will become the first southeastern European city to host CowParade.
SNT.3336.2637	Between June 1 and the end of August this year, the city will be flooded by herds of decorated cow sculptures, exhibited at well-known landmarks, such as The Palace of the Parliament, Europe's largest building, as well as on the streets and outside metro stations.
SNT.3336.2638	Over 3000 local and international artists will participate in the event, decorating more than 100 life-sized fibreglass cows.
SNT.3336.2639	The decorated cows will feature Romanian and Bucharestean themes, as well as issues related to international city life.
SNT.3336.2640	After the event ends, all the cows will be auctioned off, with the proceeds donated to the Special Olympics Romania, a charity helping athletes with mental disabilities.
SNT.3336.2641	The Bucharest CowParade is organised by Event Horizon, a Romanian marketing consultancy.
SNT.3336.2642	CowParade, which was first held in Zurich in 1998, has been held in 22 cities in 5 continents and is today the world's largest public art event.
SNT.3336.2643	Bucharest was chosen from over 500 other candidate cities and has waited for the event for a couple of years.
SNT.3336.2644	The new local government in Bucharest wants to relaunch the city's image as a creative and colourful metropolis and have therefore enthusiastically supported the exhibition.
SNT.3336.2645	The high-profile event is expected to boost the image of Bucharest worldwide, especially in the artistic scene.
SNT.106553.2646	A controversial development training course called "Landmark Forum" is cited in religious discrimination lawsuits in United States federal courts in New York and Washington, D.C.
SNT.106553.2647	The seminars are run by a San Francisco, California-based for-profit training company called Landmark Education.
SNT.106553.2648	The company evolved from Erhard Seminars Training "est", and has faced criticism regarding its techniques and its use of unpaid labor.
SNT.106553.2649	The sperm bank and surrogacy company Los Angeles-based Growing Generations is named as a defendant in the New York lawsuit, and the Democratic political action committee Twenty-First Century Democrats is a defendant in the Washington, D.C. case.
SNT.106553.2650	In separate lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, New York, and in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., former employees are suing their employers for monetary damages and claiming religious discrimination after their employers allegedly mandated that they attend courses at Landmark Education.
SNT.106553.2651	In the US$3 million federal lawsuit filed in New York, Scott Glasgow is suing his former employer Growing Generations and its CEO Stuart Miller.
SNT.106553.2652	Growing Generations maintains sperm banks and also arranges surrogacy for gay couples who wish to have children.
SNT.106553.2653	The company has offices in New York and Los Angeles, and has done business with celebrities including actor B. D. Wong of Law & Order: SVU.
SNT.106553.2654	Glasgow was marketing director of Growing Generations, and claims he was fired in June 2007 after refusing to continue attending Landmark Education seminars.
SNT.106553.2655	Glasgow is also suing for sexual harassment, and claims Miller came on to him in September 2006.
SNT.106553.2656	He made approximately $100,000 per year as the company's marketing director, and was the company's only employee based out of New York City.
SNT.106553.2657	"I want them to stop imposing Landmark on the employees, and I want an apology," said Glasgow in a statement in The Village Voice.
SNT.106553.2658	Brent Pelton, one of Glasgow's attorneys, stated that: "The Landmark philosophy is deeply ingrained in the culture of the company".
SNT.106553.2659	Glasgow said that the Landmark Education training courses were "opposite" to his Christian beliefs.
SNT.106553.2660	According to Glasgow he was questioned by Miller in May 2007 after he walked out of a Landmark Education course, and was fired shortly thereafter.
SNT.106553.2661	We stand by the allegations contained in the complaint and we look forward to proving them at trial, said Pelton in a statement to ABC News.
SNT.106553.2662	Ian Wallace, an attorney who represents Growing Generations, claimed that Glasgow wasn't fired but walked away from his position.
SNT.106553.2663	Growing Generations and Mr. Miller are very confident that these claims will be dismissed ultimately, and there's no factual basis for them whatsoever, said Wallace in a statement to The Village Voice.
SNT.106553.2664	Lawyers representing Growing Generations and Stuart Miller declined comment to The New York Post, and did not immediately return a message from ABC News.
SNT.106553.2665	In Glasgow's complaint, entered into federal court record on April 18, he asserts that Landmark Education constitutes a "religion", and "perceived their philosophy as a form of religion that contradicted his own personal beliefs".
SNT.106553.2666	He states that when he was promoted to Director of Marketing, he asked Miller if he could stop attending the Landmark sessions but was told that they were mandatory for all of the company's executives and that Landmark is "very much the language of the company."
SNT.106553.2667	Glasgow said his performance at the company was assessed based on how he was "touching, moving and inspiring" others, a phrase from the Landmark philosophy, as opposed to his business accomplishments at the company.
SNT.106553.2668	The complaint claims that the actions of Miller and Growing Generations violated Federal, New York State and New York City civil rights laws.
SNT.106553.2669	The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. deals with a separate plaintiff and company, but the plaintiff in the suit also claims that religious discrimination took place for allegedly being mandated to attend Landmark Education courses.
SNT.106553.2670	Kenneth Goldman is suing the United States Democratic political action committee Twenty-First Century Democrats (also 21st Century Democrats) and its former executive director Kelly Young.
SNT.106553.2671	Goldman was formerly the communications director of 21st Century Democrats.
SNT.106553.2672	According to Goldman's complaint, three employees of 21st Century Democrats were fired after refusing to attend the Landmark Forum course.
SNT.106553.2673	The complaint asserts that Landmark Education has "religious characteristics and theological implications" which influenced the mission of 21st Century Democrats and the way the organization conducted business.
SNT.106553.2674	Goldman's complaint states that in addition to himself, a training director and field director were also fired after they made it clear they would not attend the Landmark Forum.
SNT.106553.2675	Goldman says executive director Young infused Landmark Education jargon terms into staff meetings such as "create possibilities", "create a new context", and "enroll in possibilities".
SNT.106553.2676	He also claims that Young "urged" staff members to participate in Landmark Education events outside of the workplace, drove employees to and from Landmark functions, and used funds from 21st Century Democrats to pay for employees to attend those functions.
SNT.106553.2677	Goldman's complaint asserts that he was discriminated against in violation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act.
SNT.106553.2678	In a statement in The Washington Times, the executive director of 21st Century Democrats, Mark Lotwis, called the lawsuit "frivolous" and said: "we're going to defend our organization's integrity".
SNT.106553.2679	Landmark Education spokeswoman Deborah Beroset said that the Landmark Forum "is in no way religious in nature and any claim to the contrary is simply absurd," and stated: "While we are not a party to this lawsuit and have no firsthand knowledge of it, we can only assume that we are being used as a legal and political football to further the plaintiff's own financial interests."
SNT.106553.2680	The New York lawsuit was filed April 14, and is still in early filing stages.
SNT.106553.2681	A conference with the federal court judge in the case has been scheduled for June 17.
SNT.106553.2682	The Washington, D.C. suit began in November 2007, and entered mediation this past March.
SNT.106553.2683	As of April 15 the parties in the case were due back to court on July 11 to update the court on the mediation process.
SNT.106553.2684	Landmark Education is descended from Erhard Seminars Training, also called "est", which was founded by Werner Erhard.
SNT.106553.2685	est began in 1971, and Erhard's company Werner Erhard and Associates repackaged the course as "The Forum" in 1985.
SNT.106553.2686	Associates of Erhard bought the license to his "technology" and incorporated Landmark Education in California in 1991.
SNT.106553.2687	This is not the first time employees have sued claiming mandatory attendance at "Forum" workshops violated their civil rights.
SNT.106553.2688	In a lawsuit filed in December 1988 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, eight employees of DeKalb Farmers Market in Decatur, Georgia sued their employer claiming their religious freedom and civil rights were violated when they were allegedly coerced into attending "Forum" training sessions.
SNT.106553.2689	Many of these training programs, particularly at large corporations, claim to be purely psychological, aimed at improving productivity and morale and loyalty. 
SNT.106553.2690	 But in fact they are religious, said University of Denver religious studies professor Carl Raschke in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.
SNT.106553.2691	The DeKalb Farmers Market employees were represented by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union.
SNT.106553.2692	Consulting Technologies Inc., an affiliate of Transformational Technologies Inc., was named as a party in the lawsuit.
SNT.106553.2693	Transformational Technologies was founded by Werner Erhard, and was not named as a party in the suit.
SNT.106553.2694	The "Forum" course that the employees claimed they were mandated to attend was developed by Werner Erhard and Associates.
SNT.106553.2695	Employees said that they were fired or pressured to quit after they objected to the Forum courses.
SNT.106553.2696	The workers claimed that the Forum course contradicted with their religious beliefs.
SNT.106553.2697	The plaintiffs in the suit included adherents of varying religious backgrounds, including Christianity and Hinduism.
SNT.106553.2698	"It's like brainwashing," said Dong Shik Kim, one of the plaintiffs in the case.
SNT.106553.2699	The plaintiffs said they lost their jobs after objecting to a "new age quasi-religious cult" which they said was developed by Werner Erhard.
SNT.106553.2700	The DeKalb Farmers Market denied the allegations, and an attorney for the company Edward D. Buckley III told The Wall Street Journal that employees were encouraged, not coerced, to attend the training sessions.
SNT.106553.2701	According to The Wall Street Journal, The Forum said it would not sanction workers being coerced to attend its training sessions.
SNT.106553.2702	The parties in the DeKalb Farmers Market religious discrimination case came to a settlement in May 1989, and the case was dismissed with prejudice in June.
SNT.106553.2703	The terms of the out-of-court settlement were not made public, but the employees' attorney Amy Totenberg told The Wall Street Journal that the case "has made employers come to grips with the legitimate boundaries of employee training".
SNT.106553.2704	According to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers must "reasonably accommodate" their employees' religious beliefs unless this creates "undue hardship".
SNT.106553.2705	In September 1988, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a policy-guidance notice which stated that New Age courses should be handled under Title VII of the Act.
SNT.106553.2706	According to the Commission, employers must provide "reasonable accommodation" if an employee challenges a training course, unless this causes "undue hardship" for the company.
SNT.106553.2707	In October 2006, Landmark Education took legal action against Google, YouTube, the Internet Archive and a website owner in Queensland, Australia in attempts to remove criticism of its products from the Internet.
SNT.106553.2708	The company sought a subpoena under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in an attempt to discover the identity of an anonymous critic who uploaded a 2004 French documentary of the Landmark Forum to the Internet.
SNT.106553.2709	The Electronic Frontier Foundation represented the anonymous critic and the Internet Archive, and Landmark withdrew its subpoena in November 2006 in exchange for a promise from the anonymous critic not to repost the video.
SNT.106553.2710	Landmark Education itself has come under scrutiny for its controversial labor practices.
SNT.106553.2711	The company has been investigated by the United States Department of Labor in separate investigations originating out of California, Colorado, and Texas.
SNT.106553.2712	Investigations focused on the heavy reliance of unpaid labor in the company's workforce, which Landmark Education calls "assistants" and deems volunteers.
SNT.106553.2713	Labor based out of Colorado found that activities performed by Landmark Education's "assistants" include: "office, clerical, telephone solicitation and enrollment, as well as greeting customers, setting up chairs, handling microphones during the seminars and making coffee."
SNT.106553.2714	"Additionally, a number of volunteers actually teach the courses and provide testimonials during and after the courses."
SNT.106553.2715	The Colorado investigation's 1996 report found that "No records are kept of any hours worked by any employees."
SNT.106553.2716	According to a 1998 article in Metro Silicon Valley: "In the end the Department of Labor dropped the issue, leaving Landmark trumpeting about its volunteers' choice in the matter."
SNT.106553.2717	Metro Silicon Valley reported that Landmark Education at the time employed 451 paid staff, and also utilized the services of 7,500 volunteers.
SNT.106553.2718	After an investigation into Landmark Education's labor practices by the U.S. Dept.Labor's offices out of California, the company was deemed to have overtime violations.
SNT.106553.2720	According to the Department of Labor's 2004 report on the investigation, back wages of $187,569.01 were found due to 45 employees.
SNT.106553.2721	Labor in Texas which concluded in 2005 stated: "Minimum wage violation found."
SNT.106553.2722	"Volunteers (Assistants) are not paid any wages for hours worked while performing the major duties of the firm."
SNT.106553.2723	"The assistants set up rooms, call registrants, collect fees, keep stats of classroom data/participants, file, they also are answering phones, training and leading seminars."
SNT.106553.2724	Landmark Education agreed to pay back wages for the overtime violation, but did not comply with the overtime violation found by the U.S. Dept.
SNT.106553.2725	Landmark Education denied that the "assistants" are employees, though the Department of Labor report concluded: "Interviews reveal that the employees are taking payments, registering clients, billing, training, recruiting, setting up locations, cleaning, and other duties that would have to be performed by staff if the assistants did not perform them."
SNT.106553.2726	According to the 2004 investigative report by Pièces à Conviction in the "Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous" program, Landmark Education was investigated by the French government in 1995.
SNT.106553.2727	In the "Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous" program volunteers were filmed through a hidden camera and shown performing duties for Landmark Education in France including manning phones, recruitment and financial work for the company, and one volunteer was shown cleaning a toilet.
SNT.106553.2728	Le Nouvel Observateur reported that after "Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous" aired in France, labor inspectors investigated Landmark Education's use of unpaid volunteers.
SNT.106553.2729	According to Le Nouvel Observateur, one month after the labor investigation took place the French branch of the company had disbanded.
SNT.106553.2730	A former "Introduction Leader" to the Landmark Forum, Lars Bergwik, has recently posted a series of videos to YouTube critical of the company and its practices.
SNT.106553.2731	Bergwik appeared on a 2004 investigative journalism program on Sweden's Channel 4, Kalla Fakta (Cold Facts).
SNT.106553.2732	According to Bergwik, after the Kalla Fakta program on Landmark Education aired, "Landmark left Sweden".
SNT.770071.2733	Last night, Adly Mansour, the interim leader of Egypt, announced plans to reform Egypt's constitution and hold a new round of parliamentary and presidential elections.
SNT.770071.2734	The interim president also announced a judicial investigation into yesterday's shooting of at least 51 supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi.
SNT.770071.2735	Mansour plans to form a panel within fifteen days to review and suggest changes to the now-suspended constitution.
SNT.770071.2736	Those amendments would be voted on in a referendum within four months.
SNT.770071.2737	Parliamentary elections would then be held, perhaps in early 2014, followed by presidential elections upon the forming of a new parliament.
SNT.770071.2738	Yesterday in Cairo, protestors supporting Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood were shot outside the Presidential Guard barracks, where pro-Morsi supporters believe the former president is being kept under arrest.
SNT.770071.2739	The Muslim Brotherhood claim 53 people died, while the health ministry claim 51 people died and 435 were injured.
SNT.770071.2740	The Muslim Brotherhood claim the attack was unprovoked and those gathered were praying.
SNT.770071.2741	Colonel Ahmed Mohammed Ali, spokesman for the army, said the group had attacked security forces and were armed with "large quantities of firearms, ammunition and Molotov cocktails".
SNT.770071.2742	The Muslim Brotherhood claimed children were killed in the conflict but Colonel Ali claims the photos being used by the Muslim Brotherhood are actually photos from Syria in March.
SNT.770071.2743	Colonel Ali also stated two policemen and a soldier were killed.
SNT.770071.2744	I held my prayer mat in my hand and I started to cover my head with it.
SNT.770071.2745	"But I couldn't stop the bleeding because there was so much blood."
SNT.770071.2746	The shooting of 51 people on Monday follows violence last week which killed 36 people in Cairo.
SNT.770071.2747	The Muslim Brotherhood have asked supporters to protest non-violently and support peaceful vigils.
SNT.770071.2748	Some within the Muslim Brotherhood movement have suggested they may be outlawed, as they were under Hosni Mubarak.
SNT.770071.2749	British Foreign Sectretary William Hague said: "It is crucial that there is a swift return to democratic processes in Egypt."
SNT.770071.2750	"All sides of the political spectrum should work together for the sake of the country's political and economic future."
SNT.770071.2751	Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the intervention by the army was necessary to prevent "chaos", and said the protests that led to the downfall of Morsi are due to dissatisfaction with the efficacy of government: "When governments don't deliver, people protest."
SNT.770071.2752	Blair also blamed the "ideology and intolerance of the Muslim Brotherhood": "People felt that the Brotherhood was steadily imposing its own doctrines on everyday life".
SNT.770071.2753	Blair advised Western governments to "engage with the new de facto power and help the new government make the changes necessary, especially on the economy, so they can deliver for the people."
SNT.770071.2754	"In that way, we can also help shape a path back to the ballot box that is designed by and for Egyptians".
SNT.31295.2755	During his trial today, Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, denied the claim that he had incited his followers to commit acts of murder.
SNT.31295.2756	Instead he claimed that he had asked them to fight abroad.
SNT.31295.2757	The charges against Abu Hamza include nine counts of soliciting to murder and three of trying to stir up racial hatred.
SNT.31295.2758	The cleric also denies that he was in possession of a document which could be considered to help in the preparation of terrorist attacks.
SNT.31295.2759	The defense barrister warned the jury to ignore the comments of the press as they may have convicted the defendant before the trial has begun.
SNT.31295.2760	Comments such as "Captain Hook" and "Hook off Hooky" have been used.
SNT.31295.2761	Mr. Fitzgerald told them of "exaggeration and misrepresentation by the media".
SNT.31295.2762	The cleric faces nine charges under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, plus four charges under the Public Order Act 1986 of "using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior with the intention of stirring up racial hatred".
SNT.31295.2763	The possession of video and audio recordings with the intent to be used to stir-up racial hatred, and a final charge of the possession of the Encyclopedia of the Afghani Jihad, which, is said to have information "of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism".
SNT.31026.2764	Southampton bosses are now contemplating the sale of one of their top players, 16-year old Theo Walcott to the highest bidder.
SNT.31026.2764-1	Currently, Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea have put in bids for the player, although he admits that he wants to transfer to his childhood dream-club, Arsenal.
SNT.31026.2765	Walcott and his family are keen to take his current skills to an even higher plataeu, and feel that only this kind of skill could be achieved with Arsenal, despite the fact that other clubs have offered to outbid Arsenal.
SNT.31026.2766	He is likely to make the move to Arsenal's squad when his current contract runs out on his 17th Birthday.
SNT.31026.2767	Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger is as happy about the move as Walcott himself is.
SNT.31026.2768	Despite the fact Southampton has released no details of the proceedings, Wenger let slip that the deal was almost done, after revealing he was buying "two and a half" players; Emmanuel Abedayor, Abo Daiby - Walcott being referred to has the "half".
SNT.31026.2769	When interviewed on his interest in the striker, he revealed that he had been watching him and was a big admirer
SNT.149885.2770	Two people were killed and two others were seriously injured yesterday when a boulder collapsed onto a house in the German town of Stein an der Traun, south-east of Munich.
SNT.149885.2771	A family of four were said to have been watching television together in the lounge when a large lump of rock, about 50 tons, broke off from a 50 foot cliff above the house.
SNT.149885.2772	The boulder fell from about 15 metres above the residence and landed on top of the house, crushing it.
SNT.149885.2773	The cause of the rock fall is unknown, but police have said that there had been no prior signs that the cliff was unstable.
SNT.149885.2774	The accident, which happened at approximately 1940 local time, killed a 45-year-old father and his 18-year-old daughter.
SNT.149885.2775	A 40-year-old mother and her 16-year-old son were seriously injured and were taken to hospital for treatment, after a rescue operation that lasted into the early hours of the following morning.
SNT.149885.2776	The task involved up to 250 rescue personnel, some with sniffer dogs.
SNT.149885.2777	An official from the international humanitarian movement the Red Cross said "[w]e made contact with them early on and kept talking with them through the night as we pulled away at the debris."
SNT.149885.2778	Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian Interior Minister, spoke of his thoughts about the incident.
SNT.149885.2779	I have never seen anything like this, he was quoted as saying.
SNT.74758.2780	The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), one of the main stock indices in the United States, has broken an all-time closing record, to close at 14,000.41 points which is up 82.19 points (0.59%) from its last close.
SNT.74758.2781	Just 59 days before, the Dow hit an all-time high when it passed 13,000.
SNT.74758.2782	This is the first time the DJIA has ever closed above 14,000 since its debut on May 26, 1896.

SNT.32650.2784	Breaking News: Iran reported to U.N. Security Council. The IAEA has passed a resolution, by 27 to 3 votes, to report concerns over Iran's nuclear program to the UN Security Council.
SNT.32650.2785	Iranian officials have said that Iran will respond by downgrading its cooperation with the IAEA and resuming full scale fuel enrichment.
SNT.74916.2786	Two strong earthquakes shook the north of Argentina and a remote region of the Amazon, in Brazil.
SNT.74916.2787	The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that the first earthquake took place at 9:27 (-3 UTC) 165 kilometers from the city of Cruzeiro do Sul, in the Amazonian state of Acre and measured 6.1 degrees on the Richter scale.
SNT.74916.2788	According to Elio Murilo, sergeant of the fire brigade of Cruzeiro do Sul, the phenomenon was not felt and no injuries or property damages were reported.
SNT.74916.2789	The telluric movement took place at a depth of 632.9 kilometers.
SNT.74916.2790	At 12:34 (-3 UTC) another earthquake with an intensity of 6.2 degrees in Richter scale shook the north of Argentina, and the phenomenon was also felt in some Bolivian cities.
SNT.74916.2791	According to the USGS, the epicentre was the Jujuy region 140 kilometres east of Tarija (Bolivia) at a depth of 247 kilometers.
SNT.74916.2792	The authorities have not reported any injuries or property damage.
SNT.7824.2793	As Tom DeLay's (Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas), alleged ethical lapses began to dominate American political news stories and the Sunday talk shows, have led some Republican members of the Majority Leader’s own party to question the reasoning for his refusal to account for his actions or resign.
SNT.7824.2794	Last year, in a glimpse of problems yet to surface, the Republican head of the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, or "House Ethics Committee", presided over three admonitions that included offering to endorse the candidacy of a political lawmaker’s son in exchange for votes on legislation.
SNT.7824.2795	The ethics complaints were originally filed by Democratic Rep. Chris Bell of Texas on June 15, 2004, and began to heat up in the months prior to last year's elections.
SNT.7824.2796	A Texas grand jury is taking a hard look at Delay’s fund raising practices, and has already indicted three of his close associates.
SNT.7824.2797	Last week the Washington Post reported that Mr. DeLay took a trip to Moscow in 1997, financed by lobbyists of the Russian Government.
SNT.7824.2798	Delay’s representative, Dan Allen, told reporters "Congressman DeLay's effective leadership to build and strengthen the House majority is exactly the reason he is being targeted by liberal groups funded by George Soros."
SNT.7824.2799	But Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut, a Republican moderate, told the Associated Press that DeLay’s "conduct is hurting the Republican Party" and "hurting any Republican who is up for re-election [in 2006]."
SNT.7824.2800	The news agency reported that DeLay would look forward to meeting the charges with the ethics committee in a sit-down and blamed all of his problems on House Democrats.
SNT.7824.2801	Senator Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, advised his Republican colleagues strongly to "Be careful about how closely you embrace Mr. DeLay, as long as he's there, he's going to become a pretty good target."
SNT.7824.2802	Those Republicans working with the Majority Leader said his ethics are only a problem to Democrats trying to regain power in the House.
SNT.7824.2803	But the Ethics Committee’s membership is equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.
SNT.7824.2804	Other Republicans are starting to get jittery about their reelection hopes if DeLay is allowed to retain power.
SNT.7824.2805	Tom's conduct is hurting the Republican Party, is hurting this Republican majority and it is hurting any Republican who is up for re-election, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., told the Associated Press after making similar comments at community meetings in his home district this weekend.
SNT.7824.2806	The third-ranking Republican in the Senate, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said DeLay needs to "clear the air." 
SNT.7824.2806-1	But he thinks everything done by DeLay was "according to the law."
SNT.7824.2807	I think he has to come forward and lay out what he did and why he did it and let the people then judge for themselves, he said on ABC's This Week, a Sunday political talk program.
SNT.7824.2808	Now you may not like some of the things he's done, that’s for the people of his district to decide, whether they want to approve that kind of behavior.
SNT.124345.2809	The European Space Agency (ESA) reported on Friday that the Wilkins Shelf, an enormous Antarctic ice shelf half the size of Scotland, could break away from the continent very soon.
SNT.124345.2810	According to reports, only a thin strip of ice connects it to the Charcot Island, and cracks are expanding rapidly.
SNT.124345.2811	This is the largest shelf of ice so far to have disintegrated in the Antarctic.
SNT.124345.2812	In February 2008, the shelf lost 425 square kilometres (164 square miles) of ice, followed by a loss of another 62 square miles in May 2008.
SNT.124345.2813	During the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 square kilometers (694 square miles), or about 14 percent of its size, said Angelika Humbert from the Institute of Geophysics at University of Münster in Germany.
SNT.124345.2814	Scientists say that the shelf, if it detaches from the mainland, won't cause an increase in sea levels, as it is already floating.
SNT.124345.2815	Most scientists believe that the incident is further evidence of global warming.
SNT.124345.2816	Average temperatures in the Antarctic peninsula have increased by about 2.5 degrees Celsius (3.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past fifty years.
SNT.7939.2817	Britain's Secretary of State for Health, John Reid, is amongst those calling for the withdrawal of Conservative candidate for Dorset South, Ed Matts, after he doctored photos in campaign literature.
SNT.7939.2818	The photo in question originally showed Matts and the Conservative front-bencher Anne Widdecombe campaigning on behalf of an immigrant family living in Weymouth, in the Dorset South constituency, in March last year.
SNT.7939.2819	When the photo appeared in Matts' campaign literature, the people in the background were removed from the photo and a slogan calling for the family to be allowed to stay was replaced by one calling for immigration control.
SNT.7939.2820	The seat, taken by Labour's Jim Knight in the 2001 general election, is one of the most fiercely contested in the country, being Labour's smallest majority.
SNT.7939.2821	Conservative leader Michael Howard condemned Matts' behaviour but refused to sack him.
SNT.7939.2822	Conservative shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin, from neighbouring Dorset West, said that the message on the doctored photo was consistent with conservative policy.
SNT.67891.2823	20-year-old pitching phenom Phil Hughes cruised through hitters in just his second start for the New York Yankees, but the end result created even more frustration for the organization and fans everywhere.
SNT.67891.2824	Hughes retired 19 Texas Rangers without allowing a hit on Tuesday at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.
SNT.67891.2825	Established big league stars such as Kenny Lofton, Mark Teixeira and Michael Young could not solve the youngster's blazing fastball or sharply biting curve.
SNT.67891.2826	Even as his pitch count rose, the Yankees allowed him to keep firing.
SNT.67891.2827	He was fine, manager Joe Torre said of the 2004 first round draft pick.
SNT.67891.2828	We were going to allow him to go 100 pitches last time, so I didn't think that would be a problem.
SNT.67891.2829	Just when the Yankees thought they found an answer to their early struggles, the organization was treated to an agonizing sight.
SNT.67891.2830	After Teixeira fouled off an 0-2 pitch with one out in the sixth inning, Hughes grabbed his leg, having suffered a hamstring injury.
SNT.67891.2831	His no-hit bid ended there (Texas would break up the no-hitter in the eighth inning off reliever Mike Myers), though he did earn his first big league win in a 10-1 Yankee romp over Texas.
SNT.67891.2832	He walked off the mound under his own power, but will reportedly miss 4-6 weeks.
SNT.67891.2833	He added, "I'm at a point now where our rotation really needs it," referring to his presence on the New York pitching staff.
SNT.67891.2834	Several Yankees have already voiced their excitement for the righthander's chances in the big leagues.
SNT.67891.2835	For his part, Yankees star Jason Giambi compared him to Roger Clemens during Spring Training: "He looks like a young Rocket."
SNT.67891.2836	The Yankees are currently just 10-14, thanks in large part to injuries that have befallen pitchers Chien-Ming Wang, Mike Mussina, Carl Pavano and Jeff Karstens.
SNT.67891.2837	In a related story from today, the Yankees fired strength and conditioning coach Marty Miller.
SNT.67891.2838	Reportedly, this was out of general manager Brian Cashman's concern for the alarming number of hamstring injuries so far this season.
SNT.285137.2839	King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has announced women will be allowed to vote in the country and run for municipal elections there.
SNT.285137.2840	Abdullah made this announcement at the start of a new Shura Council term.
SNT.285137.2841	In a speech, the king said "we refuse to marginalise women in society in all roles that comply with sharia" and so made the decision "to involve women in the Shura Council as members, starting from next term".
SNT.285137.2842	Abdullah clarified that female adults "will be able to run as candidates in the municipal election and will even have a right to vote."
SNT.285137.2843	Such changes are to be put in place "according to Islamic principles," he said.
SNT.285137.2844	Muslim women, he continued, "must not be marginalised in opinion or advice".
SNT.285137.2845	Activists have sought women's right to vote in Saudi Arabia for years.
SNT.285137.2846	As it stands, women in Saudi Arabia cannot drive, nor travel without male permission, based on Sunni Islam principles.
SNT.58207.2847	Apple Inc. today has introduced the much-anticipated iPhone at the Macworld Conference in San Francisco.
SNT.58207.2848	The iPhone is claimed to be "a revolutionary mobile phone" as stated on the Apple website.
SNT.58207.2849	The device appears to be running a mobile version of the Apple operating system Mac OSX.
SNT.58207.2850	It is approximately the same size as a 5th generation iPod, it has a 3.5-inch LCD touchscreen display that is used to access all features of the phone including number dial, as well as making phone calls.
SNT.58207.2851	The iPhone plays music, movies, displays pictures and is able to connect to a wireless network.
SNT.58207.2852	Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the device by walking onto the stage and taking the iPhone out of his jeans pocket.
SNT.58207.2853	During his 2 hour speech he stated that "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, We are going to make history today".
SNT.58207.2854	Today Apple also released their Media Center device - Apple TV.
SNT.58207.2855	It will directly compete with Microsoft's Media Center operating system.
SNT.58207.2856	Apple has taken a different approach to the media center market; rather than storing content (such as movies, music and photos) on the device, Apple TV connects to a computer (Mac and Windows) over a wirless network connection and plays all content stored on that computer.
SNT.58207.2857	This makes it substantially easier for users to organize their media content.
SNT.2003.2858	The global war on smoking passed a major milestone on 30 November 2004.
SNT.2003.2859	On that date, Peru became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to reduce smoking, thus triggering activation of the treaty in 90 days.
SNT.2003.2860	According to the World Health Organization's World Health Report 2003, tobacco consumption is the single leading preventable cause of death.
SNT.2003.2861	It prematurely ends the lives of 5 million people a year, a figure which will double by 2020 if current trends are not reversed.
SNT.2003.2862	Tobacco is the only legal product that causes the death of one half of its regular users, more than many illegal drugs.
SNT.2003.2863	This means that of the current 1.3 billion smokers, 650 million people will die prematurely due to tobacco.
SNT.2003.2864	Another way to look at the effect of smoking is to measure the average reduction in life expectancy among smokers.
SNT.2003.2865	A study published in the British Medical Journal in June 2004 followed 34,439 male doctors since 1951 and showed that smokers died on average 10 years earlier than non-smokers.
SNT.2003.2866	Although the number of smokers has stabilized or fallen in developed areas, it is rising in developing or transitional regions, which contain more of the world's population and already 84% of the world's smokers.
SNT.2003.2867	To fight this increasing health threat, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) was unanimously adopted by the 56th World Health Assembly in May 2003 following almost three years of negotiations.
SNT.2003.2868	The treaty aims to reduce both the demand for and the supply of tobacco by setting standards on tobacco price and tax increases, tobacco advertising and sponsorship, labelling, illicit trade and second-hand smoke.
SNT.2003.2869	Studies show that increasing prices through taxes on tobacco products is the most cost-effective way to reduce smoking.
SNT.2003.2870	The World Bank estimated that a 10% increase in tobacco prices would, on average, result in a reduction of 4% of the demand in high-income countries and 8% in lower-income countries.
SNT.2003.2871	Thus the treaty suggests tobacco taxes or price controls, although it neither suggests specific levels nor requires any taxes or price controls.
SNT.2003.2872	The treaty requires all countries adopting it to ban, to the extent allowed by their constitutions, all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship within five years.
SNT.2003.2873	Health warnings must occupy at least half of the principal display areas of a pack, but they must not be less than 30%.
SNT.2003.2874	These health warnings must be changed regularly and may include pictures.
SNT.2003.2875	The treaty aims to reduce smuggling by requiring adopting nations to mark all tobacco packages for tracing purposes and to indicate their country of destination, as well as to cooperate with each other in monitoring and controlling the movement of tobacco products and investigating their diversion.
SNT.2003.2876	The idea for an international instrument for tobacco control was initiated in May 1995 at the 48th World Health Assembly.
SNT.2003.2877	But it wasn’t until 1999, a year after the then WHO Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, made global tobacco control a priority, that work on the present treaty began.
SNT.2003.2878	During the year after the FCTC was written, 167 countries signed and 23 countries ratified it, making it one of the most rapidly embraced UN treaties of all time.
SNT.2003.2879	The momentum growing around the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control seems unstoppable. 
SNT.2003.2880	It demonstrates the importance placed by the international community on saving many of the millions of lives now lost to tobacco, said Dr Lee Jong-wook, WHO Director-General.
SNT.2003.2881	I look forward to more countries joining the 40 states that are making it possible for this Treaty to become law.
SNT.2003.2882	Of the countries ratifying the treaty, the largest are (in order of decreasing population) India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, Thailand, France, and Burma.
SNT.2003.2883	Nations that have signed but not yet ratified include China, USA, Brazil, Nigeria, Philippines, Viet Nam, Germany, and Egypt.
SNT.2003.2884	The largest non-signers are Indonesia, Russia, Colombia, Tanzania, and Uzbekistan.
SNT.2003.2885	The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan went beyond the treaty requirements when on December 17 it became the first country in the world to completely ban the sale of tobacco.
SNT.48141.2886	Israel has purchased two more Dolphin class submarines which have the capacity to carry nuclear warheads.
SNT.48141.2887	Israel already has three older nuclear weapons-capable Dolphin submarines but the new Dolphins have propulsion systems that allow them to remain submerged for longer periods of time, according to the Jerusalem Post, making it harder for them to be tracked by satellite.
SNT.48141.2888	Experts view the purchase as a clear signal to Iran that Israel can retaliate if subjected to a nuclear attack.
SNT.48141.2889	The Iranians would be very foolish if they attacked Israel, said Paul Beaver, a British based defence analyst, speaking to the Washington Post.
SNT.48141.2890	According to Beaver, the submarines would provide Israel with both first strike and second strike capability.
SNT.48141.2891	Israel already has land-based nuclear-capable ballistic missiles in the form of the Jericho I and II missiles.
SNT.48141.2892	German officials confirm that the contracts for the new submarines was signed July 6.
SNT.48141.2893	The Jerusalem Post reports that they will be operational shortly.
SNT.48141.2894	Israel has never confirmed nor denied that it has nuclear weapons but is believed to have the world's sixth largest stockpile of the devices, with most outside estimates putting their stockpile in the low hundreds.
SNT.48141.2895	Israel's possession of nuclear arms has often been a locus of bitter controversy in the Middle East, especially among countries who believe that the world community, and especially the United States, is hypocritical in its tolerance of Israeli nuclear arms while decrying the efforts of other Middle Eastern nations to develop their own nuclear capabilities.
SNT.48141.2896	Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post reports there is a growing mood among Israel's defence establishment that the country will have to act independently to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons as the United States is unlikely to do so.
SNT.48141.2897	America is stuck in Iraq and cannot go after Iran militarily right now, according to an unnamed official quoted by the paper.
SNT.48141.2898	A report by the US House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee released on Wednesday asserts that if Iran arms itself with nuclear weapons, Israel would be pressed to respond militarily.
SNT.48141.2899	"Israel would find it hard to live with a nuclear armed Iran and could take military action against Iranian nuclear facilities," the report states.
SNT.48141.2900	Iran has continually maintained that it seeks only to develop nuclear technology for the production of electrical power, though this has been disputed by many nations.
SNT.30046.2901	Thirty-four Indonesian fisherman have been jailed in Broome in northern Western Australia (WA) for illegal fishing offences.
SNT.30046.2902	Seven of the 34 have been jailed in Australia before for previous fishing offences.
SNT.30046.2903	Their vessels were found hiding in mangroves off the Kimberley coast.
SNT.30046.2904	The fisherman were found in possession of nearly two tonnes of trochus shell, a shell valued for fashioning into high quality buttons, beads and trinkets.
SNT.30046.2905	The WA Fisheries Department says the jail terms reflect the seriousness with which the offence is being viewed.
SNT.30046.2906	Department officer Chris Mitchell says the fishermen had traversed 200 miles of Commonwealth waters and were inside the three nautical mile state limit when they were caught.
SNT.30046.2907	He says their actions are a serious breach of fisheries laws.
SNT.30046.2908	"In the early days, the courts would have given a good behaviour bond for a first offender", he said.
SNT.30046.2909	That was more specifically for the traditional sail-powered vessels, not these motorised vessels that are coming down and because these are in state waters it is far more serious.
SNT.30046.2910	On Thursday, skippers of 11 Indonesian fishing boats were fined by a Perth court.
SNT.30046.2911	Three of the men, who had previous convictions, were fined $15,000 each, with 100 days to pay.
SNT.30046.2912	The remaining eight were fined $9000 each and given 60 days to pay.
SNT.30046.2913	The captains were fined between $9,000 and $15,000 for fishing and taking trochus shell from Australian waters off the north-west coast last month.
SNT.30046.2914	Three of the captains have been caught fishing in Australian waters before between 1997 and 2004.
SNT.30046.2915	Legal Aid lawyer David McKenzie, says the fishermen were very poor and it was highly unlikely they would be able to pay the fines.
SNT.30046.2916	The magistrate ordered that they spend between 60 and 100 days in jail in Western Australia if the fines were not paid.
SNT.55735.2917	The U.S. government warned private financial services that al Qaeda is planning a cyber attack on the U.S. stock and bank accounts, officials said on Thursday.
SNT.55735.2918	Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke says: "There is no information to corroborate this aspirational threat."
SNT.55735.2919	"As a routine matter and out of an abundance of caution, US-CERT issued the situational awareness report to industry stakeholders."
SNT.55735.2920	The officials said that the attacks are aimed at destroying the databases of U.S. banking and stock market web sites.
SNT.55735.2921	The Homeland Security group claims that the threat was for all of December.
SNT.55735.2922	A U.S. official said that the threat was posted on an website and called for the attack to avenge the imprisonment of Muslims in the Guantanamo detention camp.
SNT.26095.2923	The independent and nonpartisan US congressional watchdog, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) called the Food and Drug Administration's decision not to allow over-the-counter (OTC) sales of an Emergency Contraceptive pill, "unusual".
SNT.26095.2924	Emergency Contraceptive Pills or ECPs ("morning-after" or "next-day" pills ) are used to prevent an unintended pregnancy, following unprotected sexual intercourse.
SNT.26095.2925	They are objectionable for abortion opponents who consider their use to be a form of abortion, though scientific studies (including those by the FDA) classify them as contraceptives.
SNT.26095.2926	The pill, called Plan B is manufactured by Barr Laboratories and had been approved earlier by the FDA as a prescription drug.
SNT.26095.2927	Barr Laboratories requested that the drug be approved for OTC sale for adults and prescription-only sale for minors.
SNT.26095.2928	The decision to not approve went against the advice given by the FDA's Joint Advisory Committee and its Review staff and led to a GAO investigation into the decision making process.
SNT.26095.2929	The investigation was requested by 30 House members and 17 Senators.
SNT.26095.2930	The GAO found several anomalies in the decision making process.
SNT.26095.2931	The rationale used by Dr. Steven Galson, the acting director of the Centre for Drug Evaluation and Research for rejecting the application was novel and did not follow usual FDA practices.
SNT.26095.2932	The decision was not signed off by the director of the office responsible for the application and the director of the Office of New Drugs, as they disagreed with the "reject" decision.
SNT.26095.2933	The GAO also found that the FDA's high-level management more involved in reviewing this decision than in other change-to-OTC applications.
SNT.26095.2934	The Plan B decision was the only one of 67 proposed prescription to OTC changes to be disapproved, even after advisory committees approved the changes.
SNT.26095.2935	FDA review staff told the investigators that they were told early in the review process that the decision would be made by high-level management.
SNT.26095.2936	E-mail and other documents involving the then-FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan were found to have been destroyed "routinely".
SNT.26095.2937	The FDA has disagreed with the GAO's finding that the high-level management was more involved in processing this application and that the rationale offered was novel, despite acknowledging that the adolescent cognitive ability rationale was unprecedented in FDA practice.
SNT.26095.2938	The accounts as to whether the decision to reject was taken prior to the reviews being completed offered to the investigators were conflicting.
SNT.26095.2939	The acting director cited concerns about the potential behavioral implications for younger adolescents from OTC marketing of Plan-B, given their supposed lower cognitive ability, and that it was not valid to extrapolate data from older to younger audiences.
SNT.26095.2940	However, the FDA had not considered similar "potential behavioral implications" for younger users for other OTC-switches and had previously considered it appropriate to extrapolate data from older to younger audiences.
SNT.114381.2941	On April 4, 2008 Bobbi-Jo Arnold, accompanied by her mother Mary Patricia Moore and other family members, claimed a $3.5 million lottery ticket win in Toronto.
SNT.114381.2942	On October 2 the two women were arrested by Ontario Police.
SNT.114381.2943	Both are facing charges including fraud over $5000, possession of property obtained by crime, false pretenses and uttering a forged document.
SNT.114381.2944	The family dispute has led to Ms Moore (59) filing for divorce from her husband of ten years, Gerald Moore (81), in August.
SNT.114381.2945	Mr Moore alleges Ms Arnold received the ticket from her mother, who took it from his bedside table.
SNT.114381.2946	He further alleges his wife "manipulated" his medications to leave him incapable to grasp what was occurring.
SNT.114381.2947	The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation is also named in Mr Moore's civil suit for alleged negligence in investigating Ms Arnold's claim.
SNT.114381.2948	The bail judge's order requires Ms Moore to live with her daughter Arnold in a home she purchased with the lottery winnings, and not with her husband.
SNT.114381.2949	As well, both women are ordered not to leave Essex County, Ontario and to surrender their passports to the police.
SNT.49289.2950	A gunman has opened fire on tourists in Amman, the capital of Jordan.
SNT.49289.2951	One Briton was killed and five others were injured at the Roman Theatre in central Amman.
SNT.49289.2952	Two British women were among the injured tourists, the rest were from the Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia (So far the dead man has not been named).
SNT.49289.2953	It is not yet clear whether the man was acting on his own or as part of group.
SNT.49289.2954	The attack took place at 12:30 local time (09:30 GMT).
SNT.49289.2955	The lone gunman shouted "God is great" (in Arabic) before firing up to 12 shots, according to eye witness reports given to the AFP news agency.
SNT.49289.2956	A BBC reporter in the area has said that the area is cordoned and currently being patrolled by armed police.
SNT.188351.2957	Scottish IndyCar driver Dario Franchitti won his second Indianapolis 500 in four years today after leading 155 laps, which is the fourth most in the 99-year history of the race.
SNT.188351.2958	Franchitti, aged 37, also won a rain-shortened race in 2007, when the race was stopped after 166 laps due to the inclement weather and he was declared the winner.
SNT.188351.2959	The conditions at this race were far different, with the National Weather Service reporting temperatures of 88° F (31° C) at the track at race time.
SNT.188351.2960	This temperature made the race the second hottest to the 1932 race, which reached 92° F.
SNT.188351.2961	After a failed attempt to race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup series in 2008, Franchitti returned to the IndyCar series to race for Chip Ganassi Racing.
SNT.188351.2962	With this victory, owner Chip Ganassi became the first team owner in racing history to have their drivers win both the Daytona 500 of the Sprint Cup (won by Jamie McMurray) and the Indianapolis 500 in the same year.
SNT.188351.2963	"The milk tastes just as good the second time around here," said Franchitti, referring to the ceremonial winner's milk drink following the race.
SNT.188351.2964	"I just needed to know what the other guys were doing with fuel. "
SNT.188351.2965	" There was a gap behind them and a lot of confusion. "
SNT.188351.2966	"This means so much after coming back when I went away for a year in 2008 and to come back win a championship and win the Indianapolis 500," he added in an interview in the winner's circle.
SNT.188351.2967	Franchitti won the race on less than a tenth of a gallon of fuel, after he and his team decided to not pit during the final laps of the race.
SNT.188351.2968	The race ended on a caution after a massive crash between drivers Mike Conway and Ryan Hunter-Reay, when Conway's car got caught onto Hunter-Reay's left outside wheel and was sent airborne.
SNT.188351.2969	Conway's car then hit the track's retaining wall and landed on its front side.
SNT.188351.2970	Medics took Conway out of the car, and he was taken to the hospital with a leg injury.
SNT.188351.2971	Finishing behind Franchitti in second place was British driver Dan Wheldon of Partner Racing.
SNT.188351.2972	Conway's car then hit the track's retaining wall and landed on its front side.
SNT.330067.2973	The last two journalists reported killed at the turn of the year were Syrians; just at a time when protests and violence in the country are escalating, and the Arab League begins its initial assessment of the situation.
SNT.330067.2974	Shot on December 30, and the first journalist to die in 2012, was veteran journalist Shukri Ratib Abu Burghol.
SNT.330067.2975	The senior journalist was shot in the face after arriving home from work at a radio station in Darayya, on the southern outskirts of the capital city Damascus.
SNT.330067.2976	According to Reporters Without Borders, he died three days after the shooting at Al Mouwsat Hospital.
SNT.330067.2977	Burghol, 56, was a journalist for about 21 years, working for the newspaper Al-Thawra (The Revolution) whilst also hosting a weekly show for Radio Damascus.
SNT.330067.2978	A source told the Xinhua news agency Burghol had received threats.
SNT.330067.2979	Basil Al-Sayed became the last journalist to die in 2011, shot on December 29 by a sniper in the city of Homs.
SNT.330067.2980	The Arab League has confirmed that the Syrian government have been seen using snipers against protesters elsewhere in Daraa.
SNT.330067.2981	The shooting of Al-Sayed took place in the Bab Amr section of Homs.
SNT.330067.2982	The city has been one of the hot spots for protests against Bashar al-Assad's government during 2011.
SNT.330067.2983	In the last week of the year, the Bab Amr neighbourhood was attacked by the Syrian military and experienced heavy violence.
SNT.330067.2984	The 24-year-old camera operator was a citizen journalist who uploaded his videos to video-sharing sites to spread information about the protests.
SNT.330067.2985	Photojournalists and camera operators have been some of the the most at-risk during the Arab uprisings in Tunisia and Libya.
SNT.330067.2986	Ferzat Jarban — the first known journalist to be killed in Syria — was a freelance camera operator, arrested on November 19 whilst filming protests in Al-Qusayr, Homs Governorate.
SNT.330067.2987	Currently information is hard to verify and reliable independent sources are largely banned or restricted inside Syria.
SNT.330067.2988	Foreign journalists have been barred from the country, and from covering the protests.
SNT.330067.2989	At the end of 2011 Arab League observers had sent out observers to different cities in Syria to monitor the situation, whilst one of its advisers called for the organization to retreat after Al-Assad's government reneged on agreements to halt the crackdown.
SNT.330067.2990	According to Navi Pillay, High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, more than 5,000 people have been killed during the Syrian uprising, a figure that includes around 300 children.
SNT.330067.2991	Three journalists are now known to have been killed in Syria.
SNT.330067.2992	In December, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) addressed an open letter to Syrian President Al-Assad calling for the release of all journalists in detention; the CPJ documented 29 cases of journalists being detained in 2011.
SNT.330067.2993	The CPJ reported that 45 journalists were killed worldwide in 2011, whereas — using differing criteria — Reporters Without Borders state that 66 journalists around the world died in 2011, and assert that, by almost every indicator, violence and censorship against international journalists was worse in 2011, up 16% on their 2010 figures.
SNT.727273.2994	A gunman opened fire at a hunting shop in the Russian city of yesterday, leaving six people dead.
SNT.727273.2995	Two of the victims were young girls aged 14 and 16.
SNT.727273.2996	The Moscow Investigative Committee identify the main suspect as former convict Sergei Pomazun.
SNT.727273.2997	Authorities said the man, believed to have used a hunting rifle, killed three salespeople and two bystanders, and injured another woman who died of head wounds shortly after the incident.
SNT.727273.2998	The man left the scene in a BMW, later abandoning the vehicle.
SNT.727273.2999	Local authorities have said the search involves around 1200 police; InSerbia reports a team of 50 troops have also been dispatched to assist with the manhunt.
SNT.727273.3000	Police also warned civilians the suspect may have a gas pistol and a semi-automatic rifle.
SNT.727273.3001	Regional police spokesperson Alexei Pomorov told AFP, "We do not know whether it was a conflict because there's no one we can ask: everyone's dead".
SNT.727273.3002	Police cordoned off the suspect's residence and found an empty weapons-storage safe.
SNT.122475.3003	Wall Street had its best finish since November 2008 after a four day rally with the stock market’s indexes seeing their best weekly gain in nearly five months.
SNT.122475.3004	The major indicators in the NYSE had a gain of around 10 percent.
SNT.122475.3005	This was mainly due to bank shares bouncing and alleviating fears about the economy.
SNT.122475.3006	The Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) finished on 7223.98, an increase of 54 points from March 12 2009.

SNT.122475.3012	The value of the US dollar fell against other world currencies, but gold prices increased.
SNT.100825.3013	Prince Harry has today been ordered to return home, after details that the 23 year old's front line engagement was leaked by an American website.
SNT.100825.3014	The details of the Prince's engagement had previously been kept secret by many British and international news agencies, including the BBC and the Associated Press.
SNT.100825.3015	The leak of the information was said to be "regrettable" by the Ministry of Defence, however this meant that Prince Harry was ordered to return home due to fears for his, and the others in his unit's safety.
SNT.100825.3016	Prince Harry will be flown home "immediately", after 10 weeks of front line service.
SNT.100825.3017	During this he worked as a Joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) and was involved in major operations on the frontline against Taliban forces.
SNT.100825.3018	The media blackout was created to lower the risk to the royal, whilst in service in Afghanistan, and was the first large scale agreement of its kind.
SNT.100825.3019	The media groups who signed up to the agreement were rewarded with interviews with the Prince.
SNT.39517.3020	The leader of the main opposition party, Alaksandar Milinkievič, has been jailed for 15 days in Belarus for taking part in an 'unsanctioned rally'.
SNT.39517.3021	The march, held in the centre of Minsk, marked the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
SNT.39517.3022	Held every year, it is a traditional forum for expressing political opposition.
SNT.39517.3023	At least 6,000 protesters took part, accompanied by riot police.
SNT.39517.3024	Demonstrators are said to have asked permission for the rally and to have received authorisation for having the protest on some sites.
SNT.39517.3025	Protestors say that their protest was on the authorised sites and was not unlawful.
SNT.39517.3026	Conflicts between the opposition party and the government, led by Alexander Lukashenko, have been numerous since Lukashenko was re-elected as President on March 19, 2006.
SNT.39517.3027	The opposition party has organised numerous demonstrations and rallies, and over 1,000 of their members being arrested.
SNT.39517.3028	US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has said the US "condemns this act" and called upon Belarus to act within accepted international principles on the treatment of political opposition.
SNT.39517.3029	NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has also condemned the action.
SNT.398898.3030	Tuggeranong, Canberra — Nineteen year old Australian Shadow Olympic team member Alice Ingley was attending the second day of the National Archery Championships, a few days before the start of the target recurve event that she hopes to represent Australia at the Olympics in.
SNT.398898.3031	Injuries may impact her chances, but in an interview with her, she did not think it would be a big problem.
SNT.398898.3032	The archer found out about her inclusion on the shadow team the night after returning from a concert by her favorite band, Celtic Thunder, in Wollongong.
SNT.398898.3033	The National Championships have possible Olympic qualification implications for Ingley as there are more girls on the shadow squad than eligible to compete on the full team at the Olympics, so cuts will be made based on performance at the event.
SNT.398898.3034	From here, the three Australian women chosen to represent Australia will compete at the archery team event qualifier in the United States six weeks before the 2012 London Games.
SNT.398898.3035	The possibility of individual qualification at the Games is another important part of the event, as Australia has only secured one spot for a female archer.
SNT.398898.3036	The only Olympic archery event is the target recurve competition, and it is the only event Ingley will be participating in at Nationals.
SNT.398898.3037	She has competed in field recurve but is not competing to maximize her training for Olympic inclusion.
SNT.398898.3038	She is hyper focused on the sport at the moment, with archery being her life.
SNT.398898.3039	Ingley, who might be related to the historical Robin Hood, is not a stranger to high level international competition, having competed at the 2010 Youth Olympics.
SNT.398898.3040	This event was the only time she enjoyed substantial media interest, as otherwise archery is largely ignored by the Australian press.
SNT.398898.3041	She has also competed at the first Youth Olympics, the Junior World Cup and two senior World Cups.
SNT.398898.3042	She has also participated at the 2011 University Games in China and the 2011 Olympic Test Event in London.
SNT.398898.3043	She has an American doppelganger, Miranda Leek, and the two are sometimes mistaken for each other at international competitions.
SNT.398898.3044	She is a member of the Yokine Archery Club in Western Australia.
SNT.398898.3045	Previously, for two and a half years, she had been affiliated with the archery program at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), but poor performances by the national team and other considerations led to the AIS dropping their high performance archery sport.
SNT.398898.3046	Ingley cannot drive, as she has not had the time to learn because of her archery focus.
SNT.398898.3047	When not competing in archery, she works for Western Australian Newspapers.
SNT.398898.3048	She deferred university for a year to try to realize her Olympic dream, taking time off from Edith Cowan University where she was working on a Bachelors of Arts in History.
SNT.110197.3049	Conservative Party leader David Cameron was last night a victim of crime following the theft of his bicycle.
SNT.110197.3050	The Leader of the Opposition in the United Kingdom was out shopping in West London when the incident happened at around 6:30 last night.
SNT.110197.3051	He was said to have chained the bike to a short bollard while he picked up some groceries in Tesco on Portobello Road.
SNT.110197.3052	When he came out, the bike along with its chain had vanished.
SNT.110197.3053	He stated that he "would very much like it back" and that to him "it was absolutely priceless".
SNT.110197.3054	He is also said to have reported the theft on the Scotland Yard online reporting website, but was pessimistic about it being returned.
SNT.110197.3055	The thieves are said to be a group of teenagers.
SNT.110197.3056	Around 19,000 bicycles are reported stolen every year in London alone.
SNT.110197.3057	Cameron's spokesperson said he had owned the bike for five years, and used it regularly to cycle to work.
SNT.110197.3058	She stated he was "pretty hacked off" by the theft.
SNT.13981.3059	Amid the confusion surrounding today's London blasts, officials have urged the public to avoid the city if possible to allow emergency services to operate more quickly.
SNT.13981.3060	All rail and underground stations remain closed, although efforts are being made to reopen them.
SNT.13981.3061	Air links are now closed at Stansted, Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports.
SNT.13981.3062	Those trying to contact friends and family via mobile have struggled as the largest mobile networks, Vodafone, O2 and Orange, have all suffered from full capacity on several occasions this morning meaning voice calls failed.
SNT.13981.3063	On the web, websites such as BBC, TfL and the G8 2005 website struggled for a short time at one point this morning under the strain of so many web users visiting them.
SNT.13981.3064	The national grid has said that it has sustained no damage to the electricity network.
SNT.13981.3065	On the Traffic England site run by the Highways Agency, London has been marked as a 'Closed area'.
SNT.13981.3066	The Royal Mail is warning customers that mail collections and deliveries across the UK will be disrupted because of the incidents.
SNT.13981.3067	Royal Mail vehicles will not be moving in or out of London, or between Royal Mail sites in central London for the remainder of today.
SNT.13981.3068	At least 25 per cent of the UK's mail moves through London, even if its end destination is elsewhere.
SNT.13981.3069	Bus services in Zone 1 have resumed as of 16:00 BST.
SNT.314524.3070	The following is the second in a monthly series chronicling the U.S. 2012 presidential election.
SNT.314524.3071	It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.
SNT.314524.3072	In this month's edition on the campaign trail: the campaign manager for a candidate already seeking two presidential nominations discusses the likelihood his candidate will run for the Reform Party's nomination; a lesser known candidates forum reveals an alternative fuel possibility and concludes in a dramatic fashion; and the newly nominated candidate for the Boston Tea Party talks with Wikinews.
SNT.35126.3073	At least 15 people are feared dead and at least 60 others are wounded after three explosions in the Hindu pilgrimage town of Varanasi, India.
SNT.35126.3074	At approximately 1230 UTC/0730 EST, the first explosion occurred outside the crowded Sankat Mochan temple.
SNT.35126.3075	The second took place just minutes later at the Cantonment Railway Station, leaving a crater just outside the stationmaster's room, and the third occurred on the Shiv Ganga Express, which had been leaving for New Delhi.
SNT.35126.3076	Officials say that the area has been cordoned off and the injured have been shifted to a hospital on the Benaras Hindu University campus.
SNT.35126.3077	They also report that at least four unexploded bombs were found near a holy site by the Ganges River.
SNT.35126.3078	According to media advisor Sanjay Baru, Prime Minister Manmohan "has appealed for peace and calm.
SNT.187234.3079	Taiwan electronics giant Foxconn has moved to repair its reputation after the suicide of a tenth employee this year, two others having survived attempted suicides.
SNT.187234.3080	The latest death came on the same day as Terry Gou, Chairman of Foxconn's parent Hon Hai Precision, opened the Shenzen production facility to the media for the first time.
SNT.187234.3081	In the face of accusations that he ran a modern day sweatshop, he showed off employee recreation facilities.
SNT.187234.3082	Gou, bowing as an expression of regret, promised to work to prevent such tragedies occurring again.
SNT.187234.3083	Although not a household name, Foxconn is the largest producer of electronics components and badge engineered electronics products in the world, manufacturing products for companies like Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Dell.
SNT.187234.3084	”Apple is deeply committed to ensuring that conditions throughout our supply chain are safe and workers are treated with respect and dignity”, said Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesperson.
SNT.187234.3085	Allen Pu of Fubon Securities said: "Hon Hai needs to resolve the issue because the situation is also negative for Apple and HP.
SNT.187234.3086	Labor activists have criticised conditions at Foxconn's factories as "military-style", with workers working long shifts and not being able to speak to each other.
SNT.187234.3087	However, Foxconn claims that the suicides were mostly the result of relationship problems unrelated to its own management style, and it argues that for a work force so large the number of suicides is small.
SNT.189204.3088	Police have found the body of a man they had been hunting in Cumbria, United Kingdom for a series of shootings.
SNT.189204.3089	Police later confirmed that twelve people had been killed with a further thirteen injured, three critically.
SNT.189204.3090	Shots were fired in Whitehaven, Seascale and Egremont, with a total of thirty different crime scenes.
SNT.189204.3091	The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant was locked down for the first time in its history.
SNT.189204.3092	The prime suspect was named as 52 year old local man Derrick Bird, a taxi driver.
SNT.189204.3093	The first of Bird's victims was a fellow taxi driver shot in Whitehaven at about 10.30 local time, with the following victims being shot at random as Bird drove down the west coast.
SNT.189204.3094	Originally driving a Citroën Picasso, he was later said to be on foot when he crashed his vehicle.
SNT.189204.3095	Members of the public were advised by police to stay indoors, and for those who saw him not to approach him, but to call them.
SNT.189204.3096	The manhunt covered the Boot or Scafell Pike area, and at 14:04 BST (13:04 UTC) the Deputy Chief Constable of Cumbria reported that a body believed to be Bird was found in a wood near Boot with a firearm, and that he had turned the weapon on himself.
SNT.189204.3097	The affected area is popular with walkers and hikers, and currently, many schools across England are on half term, meaning the pupils have no classes.
SNT.189204.3098	British news network BBC News spoke to several eye-witnesses in relation to the incidents, from each of the areas, including Peter Watson of Whitehaven.
SNT.189204.3099	When I first got here it must have just happened.
SNT.189204.3100	There was a man lying on the ground with police stood over him and a jacket on him, he reported.
SNT.189204.3101	Home Secretary Theresa May is due to make a statement on the incident to the House of Commons tomorrow.
SNT.106188.3102	Construction workers and next of kin of deceased workers filed a lawsuit in Tokyo, Japan Friday seeking damages of approximately 6.6 billion yen (about US$64 million) from the government and manufacturers related to illnesses stemming from exposure to asbestos.
SNT.106188.3103	178 plaintiffs; including construction workers and family members filed the suit in Tokyo District Court against 46 building manufacturers and the Government of Japan.
SNT.106188.3104	According to the Mainichi Daily News, the class action suit is the first that has been filed in Japan related to health damages caused by asbestos exposure at construction sites.
SNT.106188.3105	The plaintiffs hail from the Japanese prefectures of Tokyo, Saitama and Chiba.
SNT.106188.3106	The plaintiffs claim that the government and manufacturers knew of the dangers of asbestos inhalation but failed to take proper precautions, including ceasing to promote asbestos as a cheap fire retardant and banning production of the material.
SNT.106188.3107	They state that after inhaling asbestos in the workplace, 172 people have developed lung cancer or mesothelioma, and that almost half of those afflicted are now dead.
SNT.106188.3108	Plaintiffs argue that the government and health ministry did not act quickly enough after international organizations issued warnings in 1972 that asbestos could be a carcinogen.
SNT.106188.3109	Plaintiffs also place blame with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for sanctioning the use of asbestos under Japanese Industrial Standards, and with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport for approving the use of materials comprised of asbestos and other substances under Japan's Building Standards Law.
SNT.106188.3110	”We will do our utmost until we win the suit”, said Kazuo Miyajima, 78, who heads the group of plaintiffs.
SNT.106188.3111	Lawyers for the plaintiffs released a statement saying: "We seek complete relief for the victims by clarifying the liability of the state and the manufacturers."
SNT.106188.3112	Approximately 40 construction workers from Kanagawa Prefecture plan to file a similar lawsuit in June in Yokohama District Court.
SNT.106188.3113	After a 2005 revelation that residents who lived near a factory in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture developed diseases related to asbestos, the government implemented a law in 2006 which provides monetary assistance to asbestos victims and relatives of deceased family members.
SNT.106188.3114	The plaintiffs argue that the amount of financial assistance given to families and victims of asbestos-related diseases is not sufficient.
SNT.106188.3115	Asbestos has been used in Japan as a fire retardant, for sound absorption, and for insulation.
SNT.106188.3116	It was mixed in concrete and water and sprayed on walls and ceilings, but the practice of spraying asbestos in this manner was banned in Japan in 1975.
SNT.14383.3117	After a press conference in London from the Metropolitan Police and Transport for London, more details are emerging about the attacks in London on Thursday.
SNT.14383.3118	Data from the Underground system's power and control systems have revealed that all three bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other, at 8.50am, with the managing director of Transport for London, Tim O'Toole saying the bombs went "bang bang bang, very close together".
SNT.14383.3119	The first bomb to detonate was on the Liverpool Street train soon after it left for Aldgate on the Circle line, seconds before the others.
SNT.14383.3120	The blast tripped out the power system, visible in the control room.
SNT.14383.3121	The first call the police received that morning reported "a bang" at Aldgate East, coming within a minute of the blast.
SNT.14383.3122	The Edgware Road train, leaving for Paddington and also on the Circle, exploded opposite a train coming from the other direction, making people think at first that it was a derailment.
SNT.14383.3123	The first call to the Police spoke not of an explosion, but of a person falling under the wheels of the train.
SNT.14383.3124	The confirmation of a bomb did not come until 9.17am, but by that time the emergency services were already on scene.
SNT.14383.3125	Transport for London's new TrackerNet software is fully opertational on the Circle line, which allows for precise tracking of trains, but is not yet fully installed on the Piccadilly line.
SNT.14383.3126	The first indication of the Piccadilly line bomb was when the tunnel telephone system wires were cut by the blast, an event logged by other software.
SNT.14383.3127	The cutting of the lines then tripped out the track current.
SNT.14383.3128	The tunnel itself suffered only slight damage and is safe, but the train - which was packed with commuters heading for Russell Square - is very badly damaged.
SNT.14383.3129	London Underground declared a 'code Amber' within minutes, moving trains to platforms and opening all doors.
SNT.14383.3130	A 'code Red' - full evacuation - was set at around 9.15am.
SNT.14383.3131	O'Toole described the decision to evacuate as being "very grave, not taken lightly".
SNT.14383.3132	When questioned as to whether everything possible had been done on the day to save lives, the managing director of Transport for London was "very proud" of the choices made that morning.
SNT.14383.3133	As investigations continue, all bodies have been removed from the sub-surface Circle line trains, but the carriages themselves are still in situ while a painstaking forensic investigation takes place.
SNT.14383.3134	Currently, work is on-going to retrieve bodies and forensic evidence from the carriage of the train in the deep tunnel of the Piccadilly line near King's Cross.
SNT.14383.3135	Teams of rescue workers looking for human remains are working alongside forensics experts in a "meticulous" search to find evidence.
SNT.14383.3136	Conditions are described as being very difficult, with high temperatures and lots of dust.
SNT.14383.3137	Work was halted over Friday night when conditions became too bad, and resumed this morning.
SNT.14383.3138	The exact number of bodies still in the wrecked carriage is unknown.
SNT.14383.3139	Access from King's Cross is impossible, so workers are taking the longer route from Russell Square station to get to the front of the train.
SNT.14383.3140	Police have revealed that the bombs were 'high explosives' - not homemade.
SNT.14383.3141	However they are declining to be specific about their composition as the information could be useful when they interrogate suspects.
SNT.14383.3142	Police will not confirm or deny if any parts of a timer have been found, but have said that "any device will now be in a million pieces".
SNT.14383.3143	Police believe the use of timers more likely than suicide bombings as the blasts were so closely timed, but are not ruling out anything.
SNT.160790.3144	An investigation by the BBC has revealed that millions of dollars in famine relief aid money, including the money raised from the charity supergroup Band Aid and the Live Aid concert held by Bob Geldof, was "siphoned off" by Ethiopian rebels to buy weapons.
SNT.160790.3145	One rebel said that at least US$ 95 million (£63 million) from — Western governments and private charities — was diverted into rebel coffers.
SNT.160790.3146	This was also noted in a declassified Central Intelligence Agency assessment of the famine situation titled Ethiopia: Political and Security Impact of the Drought, in which the report states, "Some funds that insurgent organizations are raising for relief operations, as a result of increased world publicity, are almost certainly being diverted for military purposes."
SNT.160790.3147	During the 1984–1985 famine, Ethiopia was fighting Eritrean and Tigray rebels in those two northern provinces, although Eritrea has since gained its independence.
SNT.160790.3148	Since the countryside was out of the government's control, aid was brought in from neighboring Sudan.
SNT.160790.3149	Some aid came in the form of food, while other aid came as cash which would be used by the aid agencies to buy grain from Ethiopian farmers.
SNT.160790.3150	Rebels would disguise themselves as traders and merchants to get their hands on the currency.
SNT.160790.3151	I was given clothes to make me look like a Muslim merchant.
SNT.160790.3152	This was a trick for the NGOs, said Gebremedhin Araya, a senior member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
SNT.160790.3153	One such aid worker that brought the grain was Max Peberdy, who worked for the charity Christian Aid.
SNT.160790.3154	Peberdy is seen in a photo with Araya buying grain.
SNT.160790.3155	Araya said that only some of the sacks were filled with grain; the rest were filled with sand.
SNT.160790.3156	The transaction was overseen by a member of the Relief Society of Tigray (REST), the humanitarian wing of the TPLF.
SNT.160790.3157	The money was then given to TPLF leaders, including chairman Meles Zenawi, who has been Prime Minister of Ethiopia since 1991.
SNT.160790.3158	Peberdy disputes the claims that he was duped, saying, "As far as we were concerned and as far as we were told by REST, the people we were dealing with were merchants."
SNT.160790.3159	He added, "It's 25 years since this happened, and in the 25 years it's the first time anybody has claimed such a thing."
SNT.160790.3160	However, an exiled TPLF commander who lives in the Netherlands, Aregawi Berhe, is backing Araya's story.
SNT.160790.3161	He said the group got their hands on over US$100 million (£66 million) of which 95% went to buy weapons and build up a hardliner Marxist party inside the rebel movement.
SNT.160790.3162	Berhe told the BBC that the group would put on a "drama" to get the money.
SNT.160790.3163	In response to the allegations, the charity Christian Aid issued a statement saying, "There are allegations in the story which are against all of Christian Aid's principles and our initial investigations do not correspond to the BBC's version of events."
SNT.160790.3164	Nick Guttmann, who is director of emergency relief operations for the group, says the "story has to be put into context".
SNT.160790.3165	”We were working in a major conflict, there was a massive famine and people on all sides were suffering”, Guttmann said, adding, "Both the rebels and the government were using innocent civilians to further their own political ends."
SNT.160790.3166	Bob Geldof, the Irish rock star who help organized Live Aid, said, "We are talking about a disgruntled, exiled general.”
SNT.160790.3167	The essence of the report also is not just about Live Aid.
SNT.160790.3168	It's that all monies going into Tigray — that would be Oxfam, Save the Children, UNICEF and Christian Aid — somehow, we were all duped and gulled.
SNT.189131.3169	The 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference negotiations continued this week in Bonn, Germany.
SNT.189131.3170	The 4,500 attendees include government delegates from 182 governments, representatives from business and industry, environmental organizations and research institutions.
SNT.189131.3171	Luis Alfonso de Alba, Mexico's special representative for climate change, told Reuters, "Mexico does not want to raise false expectations but we certainly are ambitious".
SNT.189131.3172	He criticised the outgoing head of the U.N.'s climate secretariat, Yvo de Boer, and the European Union's climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard for their scepticism.
SNT.189131.3173	Negotiating under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , the next negotiating session is scheduled to take place in August, followed by another, final one-week intersessional meeting, before Cancún.
SNT.189131.3174	The talks were designed to discuss issues that were not resolved at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.
SNT.189131.3175	The two working groups are the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex .
SNT.189131.3176	These groups were specifically designed to negotiate a long-term response to climate change.
SNT.189131.3177	The AWG-LCA is the negotiating group tasked to deliver a new "COP16 negotiative text" ahead of the June negotiating session.
SNT.189131.3178	The AWG-KP is to focus on emissions reduction commitments for the 37 industrialised countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol for the period beyond 2012.
SNT.189131.3179	There are also two UNFCCC standing committees meetings, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation .
SNT.189131.3180	The conference is officially referred to as the 16th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 6th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.
SNT.141724.3181	European Union (EU) Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel pledged €280 (US$418) million in aid to dairy farmers Monday, after weeks of protests.
SNT.141724.3182	She said she would "empty her pockets", but that was as much as she could offer; "I don't have a special account in Switzerland or anywhere else," she commented at an EU farm conference in Luxembourg where farmers were holding their third protest in as many weeks.
SNT.141724.3183	A recent demonstration in Belgium saw farmers dump three million litres (660,000 gallons) of milk on fields — and requests from 21 EU member states for emergency aid.
SNT.141724.3184	This is in addition to the announcement in September that the EU would modify rules to allow temporary state aid payments; each farmer could receive a maximum of €15,000.
SNT.141724.3185	Last November, EU agriculture ministers planned to abolish milk quotas completely by 2015.
SNT.141724.3186	The quotas are aimed at supporting prices, as the demand for dairy products has plummeted throughout the economic crisis; in some cases, prices have halved since 2007.
SNT.141724.3187	These measures seek to alleviate temporary problems, but the commission still intends to end the quota system for milk, and reduce market intervention which helps support prices.
SNT.40787.3188	Michael Ryan, a messenger at the office of the prime minister, has been identified as the mole who leaked confidential papers to Telecom.
SNT.40787.3189	The leaked papers were detailing the plan for the government to unbundle the local loop.
SNT.40787.3190	It was to be released on Thursday with the 2006 budget, but since Telecom, a publicly traded company, found out they decided to release it early.
SNT.40787.3191	Michael Ryan, May 2, was told to shred a document, but instead of doing that he took it and gave it to Telecom's Group Financial Controller Peter Garty, a close friend.
SNT.40787.3192	He gave it to Peter Garty because he thought he would find it interesting.
SNT.40787.3193	Michael Ryan told Peter Garty to not make a copy of it.
SNT.40787.3194	Telecom shares fell from $5.65 to $4.65 following the disclosure, wiping about $2 billion off the value of the company.
SNT.40787.3195	The States Service Commission has passed the case onto the police.
SNT.40787.3196	His actions were described as "gross and disgraceful dishonesty" by Prime Minister Helen Clark.
SNT.106518.3197	Authorities in western Kenya have arrested 19 suspects in connection with a spree of recent mob killings.
SNT.106518.3198	Earlier this week 11 elderly people had been burned on suspicion of witchcraft.
SNT.106518.3199	The 8 female and 3 male victims were aged 80 to 96 according to BBC News.
SNT.106518.3200	Belief in witchcraft is widespread in the Kisii District of Nyanza Province and attacks against purported witches had happened before, but this week's attacks targeted an unusually large number of people.
SNT.106518.3201	Police launched an investigation into the incident and have deployed additional personnel to guard the area to prevent revenge attacks.
SNT.106518.3202	Approximately 300 young men were reportedly responsible for the attacks.
SNT.106518.3203	According to deputy police spokesman Charles Owino, those who can be proven to have had direct involvement in the killings would be charged with murder.
SNT.32495.3204	Fourteen bodies were found on Thursday by police in Baghdad, Iraq.
SNT.32495.3205	According to the Iraq Interior Ministry, the bodies appeared to have been tortured.
SNT.32495.3206	Each one had been blind-folded and had their hands tied behind their back.
SNT.32495.3207	The men, all civilians, were stabbed repeatedly, had marks on their wrists which suggests their wrists were tied together, and all of the victims had gunshot wounds to their heads.
SNT.32495.3208	Eleven of the men were found in the back of a truck.
SNT.32495.3209	The other three were found near a road in Rustamiya on the southeastern outskirts of the capital.
SNT.32495.3210	Police do not yet know the identities of the men.
SNT.76299.3211	A report released tonight by the Health and Safety Executive has confirmed that there is a "strong possibility" that the cause of the recent foot-and-mouth outbreak is contamination, most probably by human movement, from a nearby research facility in Guildford, Surrey, UK.
SNT.76299.3212	The labs in Pirbright, where both private firm Merial and the governmental Institute for Animal Health operate, have been subject to ongoing investigations since the discovery of a new foot-and-mouth outbreak on Friday.
SNT.76299.3213	The strain of the disease had already been identified as an O1 BFS67-like virus, which was isolated in a 1967 outbreak and was being used at the labs for research and the production of vaccines.
SNT.76299.3214	It is not yet known whether the virus escaped from the Merial or the IAH lab.
SNT.76299.3215	Since foot-and-mouth was confirmed in cows at a Surrey farm, more than 200 cattle have been culled as a preventative measure.
SNT.76299.3216	A protection zone has been set up around the affected areas and rules preventing the movement of livestock have been introduced throughout the country, with the aim of stopping further spread of the contagious disease.
SNT.76299.3217	Restrictions on the import of English beef have already been imposed.
SNT.76299.3218	The last outbreak of foot-and-mouth in the UK, in the spring and summer of 2001, resulted in total losses estimated at £8bn.
SNT.76299.3219	Seven million animals were slaughtered, and tourism was also badly hit.
SNT.3372.3220	This morning about 500 policemen occupied the Morro da Rocinha, a favela in Rio de Janeiro.
SNT.3372.3221	The action is a part of a police operation against drug dealers.
SNT.3372.3222	Police say they recovered 11 previously stolen motorcycles, a grenade, a fusil, a walkie-talkie and fireworks (the criminals usually use fireworks to warn fellows about the arrival of police).
SNT.3372.3223	Three men suspected of drug dealing were arrested: Fernando Pereira Lima (aged 22) Alessandro Martins (aged 27) and a boy (aged 17 - Brazilian laws forbid the release of names of teenagers younger than 18 in reporting legal cases).
SNT.3372.3224	The teenager allegedly shot the grenade against the policemen, but was himself hurt.
SNT.3372.3225	He is stable after treatment at the Miguel Couto hospital.
SNT.3372.3226	The drug dealers from Morro da Rocinha are in a war against drug dealers from the neighboring Vidigal favela.
SNT.3372.3227	Local populations of both Morro da Rocinha and Vidigal are endangered by the criminals, and have demanded urgent actions by the authorities.
SNT.23286.3228	The morning of Saturday the 1st was a tragic one for El Salvador, as the Santa Ana Volcano, the largest and most active volcano in the country began an eruptive phase.
SNT.23286.3229	Santa Ana Volcano's view from Coatepeque Lake changed as a huge flow of "hot mud" flowed from the crater towards the lake.
SNT.23286.3230	The road that was designed as an evacuation route from that sector of the volcano was blocked completely and the inhabitants of the area had to be evacuated by helicopters.
SNT.23286.3231	Minutes after the flow of hot mud was visible from Lake Coatepeque, a huge cloud of ash appeared, which reached an altitude of 50,000 feet, then covering the northwestern part of the country which contains the largest concentration of coffee farms (main export).
SNT.23286.3232	The local authorities expect that this layer of ash burns the coffee plants of the affected area, decreasing the coffee production of the region considerably.
SNT.23286.3233	Along with the ash cloud, a large amount of hot rocks (some reaching three feet in diameter) flew on all directions, damaging roads, homes and vegetation.
SNT.23286.3234	According to the people living in the surroundings of the volcano, the rocks were released due to the huge amount of pressure released when the ash cloud appeared.
SNT.23286.3235	Authorities report the loss of two human lives due to this incident, the cause has not yet been revealed.
SNT.23286.3236	To prevent the loss of more lives, the government decreed a red alert in a radius of four kilometres of the crater, but yet, some people resist the evacuation proposals due to fear of losing their belongings, as they have to leave their homes without any surveillance.
SNT.23286.3237	In response to this, the army and the police agreed to patrol the areas evacuated in order to prevent robberies.
SNT.23286.3238	It is expected that this incident is only the beginning of a large eruptive process, which may result in a catastrophe for El Salvador.
SNT.33095.3239	The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) will meet in Canberra today for its first meeting of 2006.
SNT.33095.3240	Members of COAG are the Prime Minister, State Premiers, Australian Capital and Northern Territory Chief Ministers, and the President of the Australian Local Government Association.
SNT.33095.3241	On the agenda is a wide range of issues such as health, economic reform, regulation, and education.
SNT.33095.3242	The state leaders (all of whom are members of the Australian Labor Party), met last night to develop a strategy for dealing with John Howard, Australia's Prime Minister.
SNT.977840.3243	Yesterday in London, former UK Prime Minister Sir John Major gave a speech at the Institute of Directors outlining his opposition to plans for Scottish independence.
SNT.977840.3244	This follows the publication earlier in the week of a white paper by the Scottish government outlining plans for what would happen if the country votes to leave the United Kingdom.
SNT.977840.3245	Major said that there won't be a currency union between a newly independent Scotland and a post-split United Kingdom: "A currency union, which the SNP [Scottish National Party] assume is negotiable, would require the UK to underwrite Scottish debts.
SNT.977840.3246	That cannot, will not, happen if Scotland leaves the Union.
SNT.977840.3247	There can be no halfway house, no quasi-independence underpinned by UK institutions."
SNT.977840.3248	Spain uses uncertainty over EU membership to deter Catalonia from even holding a referendum on independence.
SNT.977840.3249	It is hardly likely she would happily wave in Scotland.
SNT.977840.3250	Spain will not be alone in being wary of separatist tendencies."
SNT.977840.3251	Major also said that Scottish nationalists engaged in anti-English sentiment.
SNT.977840.3252	Anti-English sentiment from separatists irritates and enrages, as it is intended to do, but across the UK people know and value Scots as partners, work colleagues, friends and neighbours. 
SNT.977840.3253	A spokesperson for Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland and the leader of the Scottish National Party, responded to Major's remarks: Sir John Major is quite wrong to suggest that the rest of the UK should lay exclusive claim to all the assets of the UK, which the people of Scotland contribute to and of which Sterling is one.
SNT.977840.3254	But he is also just about the very last person the No campaign should be calling on to make their case.
SNT.977840.3255	He was the Tory prime minister who presided over his party's complete wipe-out in Scotland and the more he tries to lecture the people of Scotland, the better it will be for the Yes vote."
SNT.65338.3256	A1 Team New Zealand has won the feature race at the A1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, China today, followed by A1 Team Great Britain and A1 Team Germany.
SNT.65338.3257	The third place win for Germany has secured the 2006/2007 championship.
SNT.65338.3258	In qualifying for the sprint race, Great Britain's driver Robbie Kerr managed to secure the pole position with the fastest lap time recorded this weekend.
SNT.65338.3259	New Zealand's driver, Jonny Reid, started in second position, narrowly missing out on what would have been his third pole position of the season.
SNT.65338.3260	Third and fourth place starters are the United States and Germany respectively.
SNT.65338.3261	Great Britain managed to win the sprint race, thus securing a first place start in the feature race.
SNT.65338.3262	During the entire sprint race, Great Britain were the leaders, with a "comfortable" lead, always maintaining their position in front of New Zealand.
SNT.65338.3263	During the feature race Jonny Reid, driving New Zealand's Black Beauty car, passed Great Britain on lap number 16 of the 50-lap race.
SNT.4747.3264	After five hours of meeting, the presidents Hugo Chávez from Venezuela and Alvaro Uribe from Colombia put a end to the diplomatic tension that had completed two months.
SNT.4747.3265	The crisis started with the alleged irregular arrest (according to Venezuela) of the FARC guerrilla Rodrigo Granda by Colombian authorities.
SNT.4747.3266	President Chavez said: "We have decided to turn the page so we can fix the things that were misadjusted, clarify the things that could be clouded and work together in the construction for the common people".
SNT.4747.3267	The meeting was scheduled for early this month, however it was postponed due to a disease of the Colombian president.
SNT.4747.3268	The encounter served both to finish the harshness between the two countries and to resume bilateral agreements and the activity in the border which were paralyzed as a result of the crisis.
SNT.4747.3269	Uribe admitted that the Colombian armed conflict is a problem which must be solved by his country despite the disturbances caused by subversive groups in the neighboring countries to Colombia.
SNT.4747.3270	As a result of the meeting, the presidents will organize a binational high level commission in the next weeks.
SNT.4747.3271	The commission will evaluate the crisis's consequences, reinforce the integration between both countries and coordinate the future of the antiterrorist fight.
SNT.4747.3272	The fight against terrorism will be done by security organisms of both countries by means of a rigorous legal adjustment in the actions which implies to cooperate so that the sovereignty is not affected and the sovereignty is respected, according to Uribe.
SNT.130413.3273	A collision between Christian band MercyMe's tour bus and a car has killed two passengers in the car and the 18-year-old driver's unborn baby.
SNT.130413.3274	The woman is in critical condition following the crash, which occurred in Fort Wayne, northeastern Indiana.
SNT.130413.3275	The bus was headed to Six Flags St. Louis in Missouri for the band to play to a sold-out crowd.
SNT.130413.3276	At 1:15 a.m. Saturday, according to witnesses, the bus was going through a green light when the car made a turn in front of it.
SNT.130413.3277	No-one on the bus was injured, and the band rescheduled the show for September as a result of the incident.
SNT.130413.3278	A photograph of the damaged bus was posted on the band's website, depicting moderate crumpling to the front area of the vehicle.
SNT.3330.3279	Marxist intellectuals released a letter supporting both the arrested FARC leader Ricardo Gonzalez (also known as Rodrigo Granda) and the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
SNT.3330.3280	The FARC is accused of terrorism by the governments of the USA and Colombia.
SNT.3330.3281	Worldwide, police agencies have an interest in FARC members because of their involvement in international drug trafficking.
SNT.3330.3282	The FARC accuses Colombian authorities of capturing Granda inside Venezuelan territory.
SNT.3330.3283	Venezuelan President Chavez claims Colombia invaded Venezuelan territory and possibly bribed Venezuelan officers.
SNT.3330.3284	Colombia says the arrest occurred inside Colombian territory and that Granda was moved to Colombia by Venezuelans.
SNT.3330.3285	Colombia admitted the payment of a reward for Granda, but rebutted accusations of bribery.
SNT.3330.3286	Recently, the Colombian government released an official notice accusing Venezuela of accepting representatives of terrorist organizations in political events sponsored by official Venezuelan institutions.
SNT.3330.3287	Open letter from international intellectuals, to the international public opinion
SNT.3330.3288	The kidnapping of Rodrigo Granda, carried out in Venezuelan territory presumably by agents of the Colombian police, is an attempt to create difficulties between both countries in order to debilitate the Bolivarian movement.
SNT.3330.3289	An additional effect is to reduce the international prestige of the conduct of President Hugo Chávez creating doubts about a possible Venezuelan implication in said kidnapping.
SNT.3330.3290	All intended to cause a possible armed intervention of the United States as a result of the conflict.
SNT.9775.3291	For the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States, a first-time-ever “water quality forecast” was issued Monday for the upcoming summer season by the Chesapeake Bay Program.
SNT.9775.3292	The eastern mid-Atlantic region’s heavy spring rainfalls are predicted to increase nutrient levels in bay waters, leading to oxygen eating algae blooms and leaving deep water dead zones.
SNT.9775.3293-1	Project leader William Dennison, of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies said, “The forecast indicates that recent weather conditions and heavy pollutant loads could lead to a bad summer for the Bay.” 
SNT.9775.3293-2	The prediction is for this to be the fourth-worst season for dissolved oxygen in two decades.
SNT.9775.3294	The Chesapeake Bay Program launched the new forecast to build on a base of environmental data gathered over the last two decades as water quality concerns have grown.
SNT.9775.3295	The forecast is meant to be a proactive tool that provides resource managers with information that can be used to guide policies for the bay’s protection and restoration.
SNT.9775.3296	Cars, fertilizer, human and animal wastes, industrial and agricultural pollutants all play a part.
SNT.9775.3297	"This means that we need to do a lot more to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen pollution from getting into the bay, said Beth McGee, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
SNT.9775.3298	"The biggest source of pollution in the bay is agriculture, and we've got to find a way to provide farmers with more resources to manage the land better."
SNT.9775.3299	Nutrient rich pollutants composed mainly of nitrogen and phosphorous come from far away places carried by rivers, and nearby the bay from farm and metropolitan runoff.
SNT.9775.3300	They collect in the huge bay and meet tidal flows from the ocean.
SNT.9775.3301	Algae feed off the nutrients, and they are either consumed by aquatic life or sink at the end of their life cycle.
SNT.9775.3302	With such an abundant food source, algae blooms can cover large surfaces of water and choke off sunlight to underwater plants.
SNT.9775.3303	Later when the plants die, the process of their decomposition on the bottom consumes oxygen to a state where the water becomes anoxic, and unable to support life.
SNT.9775.3304	As notorious as weather forecasters are for often being wrong, it should come as no surprise if this first forecasting step by the federally funded program misses its mark.
SNT.9775.3305	Forces such as heavy storms or hurricanes, which churn water, would have an effect.
SNT.9775.3306	Excessive wind and unexpected precipitation, or nutrient level jumps, would also contribute.
SNT.158893.3307	An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 Mw struck the Ryukyu Islands, off the coast of Japan on Friday morning at 5:31am (20:31 UTC).
SNT.158893.3308	The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no "destructive threat" from the tsunami.
SNT.158893.3309	At its center, the depth of the earthquake had been measured at ten kilometers (6.2 miles).
SNT.158893.3310	At 5:57am local time (20:57 UTC), the Japan Meteorological Agency recorded a ten centimetre (four inch) tsunami Nanjō, Okinawa.
SNT.158893.3311	Initially the agency had predicted that the depth of the tsunami would be three feet (one metre).
SNT.158893.3312	There were no reports of damage, although, according to the Agency, "there may be slight sea level changes from now on."
SNT.158893.3313	The islands were advised to evacuate from the seashore were Okinawa Islands, Amami Islands and Tokara Islands.
SNT.158893.3314	Ivan Brackin, a resident of Yoron Island, described his experience of the earthquake.
SNT.158893.3315	"I woke up to violent shudders that lasted about six seconds then a pause followed by a couple of sharp jumps", he stated.
SNT.158893.3316	Jumpers are the most dangerous so that sent me under the desk.
SNT.101796.3317	Jayant Patel, wanted for manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and fraud in Australia, was arrested by FBI agents in Oregon, United States and is scheduled to face an extradition hearing on April 10.
SNT.101796.3318	According to an affidavit filed by US prosecutors, Patel, previously restricted from performing surgery in the US due to "professional misconduct", lied about his professional history in order to work at Bundaberg Base Hospital in Bundaberg, Queensland.
SNT.101796.3319	Patel performed surgeries at Bundaberg that are alleged to have directly led to the deaths of several of his patients, including one procedure which he had previously been banned from performing in Oregon.
SNT.101796.3320	If successfully extradited to Australia, Patel "will get a fair trial", according to the Federal Member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, whose electorate includes Bundaberg, although the extradition may take some time due to Patel's US citizenship.
SNT.122543.3321	A Vietnamese coal transport ship sank in the South China Sea on Friday killing three people on board, reported the Xinhua News Agency.
SNT.122543.3322	The ship sank from the Fangcheng Port in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
SNT.122543.3323	The Nanhaijiu 196 rescue vessel was dispatched about 8 pm local time, when authorities were notified that the ship may sink.
SNT.122543.3324	There were winds up to 90 kilometers per hour when the ship sank during a gale.
SNT.122543.3325	Saturday morning rescue operations were supplemented by a rescue helicopter.
SNT.122543.3326	There were a total of seven crew members on board.
SNT.122543.3327	Four are missing, while three bodies have been recovered by the South China Sea Rescue Bureau.
SNT.73610.3328	25 people were killed today and 33 were injured when a large explosion ripped through a karaoke bar in Tianshifu, Liaoning Province, China.
SNT.73610.3329	The state-run Xinhua news agency says the cause of the disaster is under investigation.
SNT.73610.3330	Four people are reported to be in a serious condition.
SNT.73610.3331	Originally, Xinhua reported only five fatalities, but as rescue workers continued to move away debris, the full extent of the death toll was discovered.
SNT.73610.3332	Xinhua has also reported that several employees at the bar, as well as the wife of the owner, were being questioned.
SNT.73610.3333	According to a philly.com article authored by The Associated Press, Xinhua failed to state whether this was as witnesses or as suspects in any potential criminal activity, but the Shanghai Daily said that Xinhua had reported the people had been detained as suspects.
SNT.73610.3334	The owner himself, Mr. Qu, was killed in the blast.
SNT.73610.3335	Investigators say they are currently unsure if the blast was purely accidental, or if foul play was involved, as all efforts were initially focused on attempting to locate survivors.
SNT.73610.3336	The two-storey building, which also housed a bathhouse, was completely leveled by the blast.
SNT.73610.3337	In addition, several cars were buried under the debris and windows in nearby buildings were shattered by the pressure wave.
SNT.73610.3338	A power cut in the area was also caused by the blast due to damage to the local electricity network.
SNT.73610.3339	77-year-old local resident Chen Xiaohong, who lives 50 metres from ground zero, described the explosion: "I was watching my grandson finishing his lessons.
SNT.73610.3340	Suddenly, we heard a big bang, then the door burst open from effects of a powerful shock wave and the lights went out...
SNT.73610.3341	Meng Xianling, who runs a seafood stall located down a narrow lane opposite the site of the accident building, commented that "I was afraid the parlor's boiler would explode.
SNT.73610.3342	China has been the location of many disasters in both public and private places, such as fires and explosions.
SNT.73610.3343	Earlier this year, an unsafe arrangement with a two-ton steel ladle resulted in the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation disaster, in which molten steel was accidentally poured into a room full of workers, killing 32.
SNT.73610.3344	The majority of China's accidents stem from a combination of lax safety regulations and negligence, and accidents continue regularly despite promises by the government to prevent them.
SNT.185825.3345-1	US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has given federal prosecutors until next Friday to respond to the request of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and his brother Robert to delay their corruption trial. 
SNT.185825.3345-2	The trial is set to begin on June 3, and many of the charges they face are based on a federal honest-services law.
SNT.185825.3346	The Blagojevich brothers challenge the constitutionality of this law and believe the trial should be delayed until the high court is expected to decide the issue next month.
SNT.185825.3347	The request had already been denied by District Judge James Zagel and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
SNT.185825.3348	Stevens, who handles appeals from the Seventh Circuit, had three options: reject the request for a delay of trial, grant it, or allow the federal government to respond.
SNT.185825.3349	We believe that means he sees this as not frivolous, and he’s going to decide it on the merits, said Michael Ettinger, Robert's attorney.
SNT.185825.3350	Prosecutors added new charges, including bribery, against the brothers in case the Supreme Court finds the honest-services law unconstitutional.
SNT.185825.3351	They believe the June 3 start date should not be held back. 
SNT.59872.3352	An airplane, a Warrior PA28 that went missing at 1700 GMT may have been found Saturday night, February 3rd as rescuers searching for the airplane have discovered wreckage about a mile from South Shore near Blackpool, England.
SNT.59872.3353	The pilot of the air plane reported to Blackpool Tower that he was low on fuel before 5 pm Saturday evening and disappeared from radar screens shortly afterwards.
SNT.59872.3354	There is no news about the two men who were on board the airplane.
SNT.59872.3355	The weather conditions on parts of the coast are described as foggy.
SNT.59872.3356	Three lifeboats, two coastguard teams and an RAF helicopter are searching for the airplane which was believed to have been traveling from Exeter to Blackpool, says Lancashire Police.
SNT.56299.3357	Blogger George Vaccaro is a customer from the US who apparently purchased wireless network connection from Verizon, thinking that he was getting a good deal.
SNT.56299.3358	Instead, he says he was charged about 71 dollars instead of 71 cents: 100 times more than what his bill should have been at the rate quoted.
SNT.56299.3359	When he called the Verizon customer service, he said he also found out that several Verizon representatives think 0.002 cents is equal to 0.002 dollars.
SNT.56299.3360	According to the phone conversation recording he posted to his blog,
SNT.56299.3361	Vaccaro also posted on his blog the text of what he said was an e-mail reply from a Verizon Wireless customer service representative on December 8, stating:
SNT.119141.3362	The United Nations (UN) suspended all of its operations in Gaza from yesterday, after the bombing of a convoy of UN aid trucks which killed one Palestinian driver, and wounded three others.
SNT.119141.3363	Thursday was the second day of attacks on UN targets after three UN schools housing refugees were bombed on Tuesday, killing over 50 civilians.
SNT.119141.3364	"UNRWA decided to suspend all its operations in the Gaza Strip because of the increasing hostile actions against its premises and personnel", Adnan Abu Hasna, a Gaza-based spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said yesterday.
SNT.119141.3365	Richard Miron, spokesman for the UN said that the Israeli military had been notified in advance of the coordinates of the relief trucks saying, "This underlines the fundamental insecurity inside Gaza at a time when we are trying to address the dire humanitarian needs of the population there."
SNT.119141.3366	The bombing of the UN trucks was the last straw for the UN, already angered after Israeli tanks fired on a UN school housing refugees killing 50 including an entire family of seven young children.
SNT.119141.3367	The UN said that they had given Israel the GPS coordinates of their schools, and demanded accountability for the attacks.
SNT.119141.3368	More schools were attacked including the al-Fakhora School killing 40 people, many of them women and children.
SNT.119141.3369	Hours before the attack on the al-Fakhora School was an attack on Asma Elementary School which killed three Palestinian cousins.
SNT.119141.3370	The cousin's father said the bodies were so mangled he couldn't tell the bodies apart, "We came to the school when the Israelis warned us to leave," he said.
SNT.119141.3371	A relative came and told me one of my sons was killed.
SNT.119141.3372	The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on yesterday that they were trying for four days to get their ambulances to a Gaza neighborhood before being allowed to by Israeli military forces.
SNT.119141.3373	After getting there, they said, they found four starving children sitting next to the bodies of their dead mothers.
SNT.119141.3374	"This is a shocking incident", said Pierre Wettach, ICRC chief for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.
SNT.119141.3375	The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded.
SNT.119141.3376	Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestinian Red Crescent to assist the wounded.
SNT.119141.3377	Israel granted a three-hour ceasefire yesterday that they gave for aid workers to enter areas that they had closed off.
SNT.119141.3378	50 bodies were recovered during the ceasefire, raising the death toll to 763, including more than 200 children, since air raids first began on December 27.
SNT.119141.3379	Eight Israeli soldiers and three civilians have died in the same period.
SNT.119141.3380	Israeli forces also shot a Palestinian man in the West Bank during a protest against Israel's actions in Gaza.
SNT.119141.3381	Yesterday, a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces after a confrontation in the West Bank Jewish settlement of Ma'ale Adumim near Jerusalem.
SNT.149941.3382	Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has admitted sixteen instances of sensitive information being leaked on social networking websites in the past eighteen months.
SNT.149941.3383	Ten employees have been disciplined for misuse of the sites.
SNT.149941.3384	The revelations follow a Freedom of Information request by Lewis PR and computer security company F-Secure.
SNT.149941.3385	The MoD would not comment on what disciplinary action was taken, or whether the leaks involved operational information.
SNT.149941.3386	The ministry's guidelines state that staff must obtain clearance to release any information that is related to sensitive, controversial or political matters, or military operations.
SNT.149941.3387	"It's worrying that employees in sensitive positions have been sharing confidential information via Twitter and other means", said Mikko Hypponen, of F-Secure.
SNT.149941.3388	According to Lewis PR, computers on the main MoD networks are blocked from visiting social networking sites.
SNT.149941.3389	However there are a small number within the department which have unrestricted Internet access.
SNT.149941.3390	Some personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq also have access through internet cafés on military bases.
SNT.149941.3391	The ministry's "online engagement guidelines", released in August last year, recognise the importance of social media such as Facebook for personnel keeping in touch with friends and family.
SNT.149941.3392	According to the document: "Service and MOD civilian personnel are encouraged to talk about what they do, but within certain limits to protect security, reputation and privacy."
SNT.111540.3393	On August 11, United States Senator and 2008 presidential Republican candidate John McCain gave a speech regarding the crisis between Georgia and Russia.
SNT.111540.3394	Following the speech, a regular Wikipedia editor noticed that his speech was very similar to an article on Wikipedia also regarding the crisis, in what could be considered plagiarism.
SNT.111540.3395	Wikinews was able to talk to that editor about how he found out about the similarities and what he did in response.
SNT.111540.3396	Wikinews also took a deeper look at the claim and investigated further.
SNT.111540.3397	McCain gave his speech in Erie, Pennsylvania and was speaking to citizens, giving a warning to Russia stating, "Russian President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin must understand the severe, long-term negative consequences that their government’s actions will have for Russia’s relationship with the U.S. and Europe."
SNT.111540.3398	McCain continued his speech saying, "Georgia is an ancient country, at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and one of the world’s first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion.
SNT.111540.3399	After a brief period of independence following the Russian revolution, the Red Army forced Georgia to join the Soviet Union in 1922.
SNT.111540.3400	As the Soviet Union crumbled at the end of the Cold War, Georgia regained its independence in 1991, but its early years were marked by instability, corruption, and economic crises."
SNT.111540.3401	While reading the first few paragraphs, the Wikipedia editor Killing Vector, (who wishes to be called by his contributor name in fear of retribution for coming forward with the claim), noticed a striking similarity to McCain's speech and the Wikipedia article on the country of Georgia.
SNT.111540.3402	Not only did he notice the similarities, but after reading through the article's edit history, 'Killing Vector' noticed that his speech might have been lifted from Wikipedia, with some of the material in McCain's speech dating prior to the start of the Georgian and Russian crisis.
SNT.111540.3403	I began reading the text of McCain's address on the Georgia crisis, and as I was browsing it the irregularity jumped out almost immediately.
SNT.111540.3404	The paragraphs which discussed the history of Georgia simply didn't fit with the rest of the speech; the rhetorical style was jarringly different.
SNT.111540.3405-1	I figured, where's someone in a hurry going to get basic information on the Republic of Georgia?"
SNT.111540.3405-2	I opened up Wikipedia, went to the article, picked a recent but not current revision more or less at random (July 24th), and hit gold on the first try; McCain's speech and the Wikipedia article had significant strings of words in common, emphasized the same events, made largely the same word choices," Vector said to Wikinews.
SNT.111540.3406	Although other media outlets reported the alleged plagiarism, the two passages below were dated at least one week prior to the Georgian and Russian crisis.
SNT.111540.3407	The first two paragraphs of McCain's speech appear to resemble the Wikipedia article in the history dated July 24, 2008.
SNT.111540.3408	Two paragraphs, about an eighth of the full speech, contain material directly copied from Wikipedia or superficially modified from its text.
SNT.111540.3409	Those two paragraphs constitute the entire factual background of the speech, though — the rest is reaction and proposed policy, added Vector.
SNT.111540.3410	McCain's campaign denies they plagiarized Wikipedia, but also didn't state whether they used it as a source for his speech.
SNT.111540.3411	There are only so many ways to state basic historical facts and dates and that any similarities to Wikipedia were only coincidental," said a spokesman for the McCain campaign, Brian Rogers to The Politico.
SNT.111540.3412	Wikinews contacted McCain's campaign, but has yet to receive a response.
SNT.111540.3413	Wikinews e-mailed Jay Walsh, the director of communications for the Wikimedia Foundation to see what they thought of the situation, and what if anything they planned to do about it.
SNT.111540.3414	"We aren't particularly concerned with this", said Walsh who also added that "I'm only aware of this situation through media coverage I've seen, nor do we or I have any in-depth detail about the situation."
SNT.111540.3415	I would say it's a good practice to attribute text or content whenever possible.
SNT.111540.3416	Obviously when it's a matter of copyright then there are legal considerations, but the Foundation is not able to examine individual cases, added Walsh.
SNT.111540.3417	Wikinews attempted to contact Mike Godwin, the legal counsel for the Foundation, but has yet to receive a response.
SNT.111540.3418	Vector stands by his claim and also notes what he calls 'dishonesty' on the part of McCain's campaign.
SNT.111540.3419	What concerns me more, as a voter, is the ethical issue.
SNT.111540.3420	"Plagiarism comes from dishonesty and intellectual laziness on the part of an individual, but McCain's campaign's later denial adopts that individual's dishonesty", stated Vector.
SNT.8928.3421	66 passengers and the crew of a New York to San Francisco UAL flight got an unwanted stop in the "Windy City," Chicago, on Tuesday, following a bomb scare.
SNT.8928.3422	United Air Lines spokesman Jeff Green said a flight attendant was alerted by a passenger to another passenger's suspicious materials and wires.
SNT.8928.3423	The crew decided to divert the flight to O’Hare, empty the plane, and allow the bomb squad to inspect for safety.
SNT.8928.3424	They discovered vials of herbal liquids, some wires, and an MP3 player.
SNT.8928.3425	The passenger and music player were reunited, everybody re-boarded the aircraft, and with three hours lost, the flight took off for San Francisco.
SNT.593147.3426	Before a crowd of 575 on Saturday at Wembley Park in Box Hill, metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, W-League team Canberra United lost to the Melbourne Victory 0–3 in the team's first loss since January of last year.
SNT.593147.3427	Two of the Victory's goals came in the first half, with Canadian import Jessica McDonald and English import Jessica Fishlock each scoring for the Victory.
SNT.593147.3428	Enza Barilla scored the third unanswered goal for the Victory in the second half.
SNT.593147.3429	Canberra went into the game with a depleted roster, with six players called away to participate in national team training, suspended or out because of injury, including team captain Ellie Brush, midfielder Sally Shipard, Michelle Heyman, goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold, striker Ashleigh Sykes, and winger Hayley Raso.
SNT.593147.3430	Caitlin Munoz filled in as the team's captain in Brush's absence, while Sally Rojahn and Catherine Brown each had their first United start and Grace Gill earned her first start of the season.
SNT.593147.3431	Victory coach Mike Mulvey is quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald following the game as saying, "It's a good win, there's no doubt about that, but it could have been a more emphatic victory.
SNT.593147.3432	We put three in the back of the net, and it could easily have been double that."
SNT.593147.3433	The win moved Melbourne up to second place on the ladder, and continued the team's dominance over Canberra who now have 1 win and 6 losses playing away in Victoria.
SNT.593147.3434	United's loss was one of three upsets in the round, with the Sydney FC losing to the Perth Glory 1–3 and the Brisbane Roar FC W-League losing to the Western Sydney Wanderers FC 1–2.
SNT.593147.3435	Later tonight, the team departs for Tokyo to compete in the International Women's Club Championship against some of the best women's club teams in the world including Japan's INAC Kobe Leonessa and NTV Beleza, and France's Olympique Lyonnais.
SNT.593147.3436	Canberra's first game is against INAC Kobe Leonessa on Thursday.
SNT.593147.3437	If they win the competition, the player bonuses would be greater than the one they received for winning last year's W-League grand final.
SNT.18893.3438	A robotic system at Stanford Medical Center was used to perform a laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery successfully with a theoretically similar rate of complications to that seen in standard operations.
SNT.18893.3439	However, as there were only 10 people in the experimental group (and another 10 in the control group), this is not a statistically significant sample.
SNT.18893.3440	If this surgical procedure is as successful in large-scale studies, it may lead the way for the use of robotic surgery in even more delicate procedures, such as heart surgery.
SNT.18893.3441	Note that this is not a fully automated system, as a human doctor controls the operation via remote control.
SNT.18893.3442	There were concerns that doctors, in the future, might only be trained in the remote control procedure.
SNT.18893.3443	Ronald G. Latimer, M.D., of Santa Barbara, CA, warned "The fact that surgeons may have to open the patient or might actually need to revert to standard laparoscopic techniques demands that this basic training be a requirement before a robot is purchased.
SNT.18893.3444	We should not be seduced to buy this instrument to train surgeons if they are not able to do the primary operations themselves."
SNT.18893.3445	A previous "new technology", the electrocardiogram (ECG), has lead to a lack of basic education on the older technology, the stethoscope.
SNT.18893.3446	As a result, many heart conditions now go undiagnosed, especially in children and others who rarely undergo an ECG procedure.
SNT.45054.3447	Today, it was announced that Syd Barrett, the founding member of British rock band Pink Floyd died from a complication with diabetes.
SNT.45054.3448	According to a Pink Floyd spokeswoman, he died days earlier (July 7) but the announcement was withheld.
SNT.45054.3449	There will be a private family funeral in the next few days," said his brother Alan Barrett.
SNT.45054.3450	The band are naturally very upset and sad to learn of Syd Barrett’s death.
SNT.45054.3451	Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire, noted a statement issued by Pink Floyd.
SNT.45054.3452	During 1967-1968, Syd Barrett was considered to be the main member and songwriter of Pink Floyd.
SNT.45054.3453	However, due to mental illness, he was forced to leave the band after recording only one album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.
SNT.45054.3454	Pink Floyd recorded Wish You Were Here as a tribute following Barrett's leave.
SNT.45054.3455	The album features Shine On You Crazy Diamond, with lyrics explicitly about Barrett's rise to fame and subsequent dissolution.
SNT.54885.3456	An alleged Russian spy was arrested in Montreal, having threatened national security.
SNT.54885.3457	The man is identified as a Russian spy and has been living under a false name.
SNT.54885.3458	As he prepared to board a plane out of Canada, Canada Border Services agents took the man into custody at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Montreal on Tuesday.
SNT.54885.3459	Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day and Immigration Minister Monte Solberg signed the document that authorized the man's arrest.
SNT.54885.3460	This document is called the national security certificate and is rarely used.
SNT.54885.3461	The certificate alerts Ottawa about possible threats to the country.
SNT.54885.3462	The ministers of immigration and public safety are obliged to sign the national security certificate.
SNT.54885.3463	The government's most important duty is to ensure the security of all Canadians.
SNT.54885.3464	A security certificate has been issued ... against a foreign national.
SNT.54885.3465	A foreign national alleging to be a Canadian citizen named Paul William Hampel was arrested in Montreal after a national security certificate under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was issued against him."
SNT.54885.3466	The man came to Canada several years ago with the name of Paul William Hampel, and is now reported to be false.
SNT.54885.3467	Officials at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) are working on identifying the man who entered Canada years ago.
SNT.54885.3468	More information will become available as the Federal Court process unfolds.
SNT.54885.3469	Any speculation about the individual's other nationality is premature at this point," Barbara Campion, a spokesperson for CSIS.
SNT.54885.3470	Ottawa believed the man had been "engaging in an act of espionage or an act of subversion," and "belonged to an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages."
SNT.54885.3471	"I don't think we're going to get the most intimate of details, no, not at all", he told CTV Montreal....We'll see a public version of the allegations that will be released by the federal court judge who is going to be responsible for reviewing the basis upon which cabinet will have declared this individual subject to a security certificate.
SNT.54885.3472	"beyond that, though, we may see things settle more quietly between governments," said David Harris, former chief of strategic planning at CSIS.
SNT.54885.3473	There are also influence operations where countries might try to influence their expatriates and émigré communities in Canada.
SNT.54885.3474	"Beyond that, there is a real appetite building among many countries for technological secrets", he said.
SNT.54885.3475	They can be of use to industries of the sponsoring nations and these things can have values in the billions for the economies of those countries undertaking these operations.
SNT.54885.3476	Reports say the man's methods in Canada matched the techniques used by the Russian intelligence agency's Directorate S, which runs the Russian spy network.
SNT.54885.3477	Twenty people since 1991 have been charged under the Security Certificate legislation in Canada.
SNT.54885.3478	The court hearing for the man being held in Montreal will be on Wednesday.
SNT.54885.3479	It is still unclear if the hearing will be in Ottawa, the nations capital, or in Montreal.
SNT.121330.3480	The call-in quiz show is a staple of cheap programming throughout Europe.
SNT.121330.3481	The format is simple: a question is displayed on screen, and callers phone in with their guesses – paying a premium rate to do so.
SNT.121330.3482	The programs are often repetitive, the average question simple, the average prize small.
SNT.121330.3483	Throwing the telephone down on the studio floor and stomping on it, she admonished her viewers, "I want the telephone to ring now.
SNT.121330.3484	After presenting the broadcasts of this morning's call-in programs, including the same one she was supposedly fired from in January, Ms Lupșe spoke to Wikinews from her television studio in Budapest, Hungary to give her first full-length English interview and talk about her work and her version of events.
SNT.121330.3485	We want to look like the celebrities that television launches."
SNT.121330.3486	I wanted to get some attention and get people to know my face.
SNT.121330.3487-1	I want this attention because I'm aware of the fact that it is not easy to enter this world!
SNT.121330.3487-2	And I was doing all this in order to increase my chances to get my dream job in television."
SNT.121330.3488	She describes a typical day: "One hour and a half before the show I'm in the make-up room.
SNT.121330.3489	After I'm done with hair and make-up I go down to the studio for the before the show to talk to the producer.
SNT.121330.3490	And then is the result that anyone gets to see."
SNT.121330.3491	All of her banter on-air is improvised: "Definitely there is no script! Everything that you see comes out spontaneosly during the show."
SNT.121330.3492-1	I enjoy it very much! 
SNT.121330.3492-2	If I'm tired at the end of the show it means I've done a good show.
SNT.121330.3493	When I play a clip of one of her energetic show presentations – not the one she's become best known for – she elaborates on her exuberance.
SNT.121330.3494-1	I'm always excited when I'm about to give big prizes! 
SNT.121330.3494-2	There is no show without winners!
SNT.121330.3495	She went to the studio, prepared her hair and makeup, spoke to the producer, and went onscreen.
SNT.121330.3496	The only thing out of the ordinary, she says, was the size of the prize: 1500 leu, about $US 450, or roughly a month's wage for a typical Romanian.
SNT.121330.3497	She says she and her show weren't fired or fined.
SNT.121330.3498	The first inkling she had, in fact, that there was something unusual about that day's broadcast was when, on January 9 2009, MTV Russia aired the clip of her shouting and stomping on the phone, mixed with some dramatic orchestral rock music.
SNT.121330.3499	That same clip, uploaded onto video service YouTube, quickly garnered over one million views.
SNT.121330.3500-1	And as for the charge most frequently leveled against her, that she's "crazy": "I think it is normal that people have prejudicies, everyone is free to express his opinion in the same way that I'm free to do my job the best that I can!
SNT.121330.3500-2	 I'm hurt if my family is unhappy with people's comments but I think I gain the wisdom to ignore the negative feedback!
SNT.164627.3501	As reported the United Nations, January 12 Haiti earthquake left exactly 222,570 deaths, 1,300,000 refugees in harbours, 766,000 displaced people, 310,000 injured and 869 disappeared.
SNT.164627.3502	The report also mentioned economic loss suffered by the country, that reached 7.754 billion dollars, leaving 71 percent of the Haitians in extreme poverty.
SNT.164627.3503	The document was diffused in Santo Domingo de Guzmán, between the preparatives of a conference about the reconstruction of Haiti, that will take place next March 11 in New York.
SNT.164627.3504	Haitian Government representatives have asked to donors an additional help of 350 million dollars for the Haiti reconstruction, the most poor country in the Americas.
SNT.164627.3505	The damages report was prepared by the Haitian Government with the support of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank, the United Nations and the European Union.
SNT.78884.3506	India have beaten England by two wickets in the sixth One-Day International of the series at The Oval, London, England.
SNT.78884.3507	England suffered early setbacks when Alastair Cook was caught behind for a duck in the first over, followed by Matt Prior falling lbw to Ajit Agarkar soon afterwards.
SNT.78884.3508	Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen shared a partnership of 59 runs before Bell was bowled by Piyush Chawla just short of 50 runs.
SNT.78884.3509	Paul Collingwood made just one run before being run out to leave England on 83-4.
SNT.78884.3510	Kevin Pietersen and ODI debutant Luke Wright both recorded fifties, with Wright sharing 106 runs with Owais Shah.
SNT.78884.3511	Shah reached 107 not out, and Dimitri Mascarenhas finished England's innings by hitting five sixes off the last five balls.
SNT.78884.3512	The final match will be played at Lord's, London on 8 September.
SNT.516059.3513	London, England — This morning Australia's Minister for Sport, Kate Lundy, watched Elizabeth Kosmala and Natalie Smith qualifying for the finals in the women's R2-10m air pistol SH1 event.
SNT.516059.3514	Lundy is expected to be in London for the entire Paralympics, and is scheduled to watch athletics, cycling, powerlifting, rowing, swimming, wheelchair rugby, basketball and tennis.
SNT.516059.3515	Whilst here, she is to obtain feedback from the Australian Paralympic community regarding government support of sport for the disabled.
SNT.47133.3516	Some of the United Kingdom's most influential British Muslims have written a letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair saying that there must be urgent changes to UK foreign policy.
SNT.47133.3517	In the memo, they say current government policy musters fanaticism and puts ordinary people at risk in both the United Kingdom and abroad.
SNT.47133.3518	They also urge the Prime Minister to extend his efforts in tackling terrorism and extremism.
SNT.47133.3519	The letter has been signed by three Muslim Members of Parliament, three Muslim peers and thirty-eight Muslim groups including the Muslim Council of Britain, the Muslim Association of Britain, the British Muslim Forum and the Muslim Solidarity Committee.
SNT.47133.3520	Sadiq Khan, one of the Members of Parliament to sign the letter, condemns the Government’s stance on the Middle East.
SNT.47133.3521	This government has had some major foreign policy successes that have helped make the world a better place.
SNT.47133.3522	But current policy on the Middle East is seen by almost everyone I speak to as unfair and unjust.
SNT.47133.3523	Whether we like it or not such a sense of injustice plays into the hands of extremists.
SNT.47133.3524	As moderates we will do all we can to fight extremism.
SNT.47133.3525	We hope the government will join us in this, not just by changing the rules on hand luggage, but by showing itself as an advocate for justice in the world.
SNT.47133.3526	In a response to the letter, a 10 Downing Street spokesman said: "We should always remember that the terrorism affecting the West today has blighted Muslim countries for several decades.
SNT.47133.3527	It certainly pre-dated our decision to support democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq and of course the September 11 attacks.
SNT.47133.3528	Our foreign policy is focused on supporting the people of those countries in their desire to live in a democracy just as we enjoy in the UK."
SNT.47133.3529	Downing Street also said that Tony Blair "stands ready" to meet with Muslim representatives when he returns to the UK from his holiday in the Caribbean.
SNT.47133.3530	The letter comes after police foiled an alleged attempt by terrorists to blow up several planes travelling mid-air from the United Kingdom to the United States of America.
SNT.199156.3531	An accident involving two school buses, a tractor trailer and an sport utility vehicle has left at least two people dead and fifty more injured about 40 miles outside of St. Louis, Missouri according to reports.
SNT.199156.3532	The school buses were carrying students from St. James High School and were en route to the Six Flags St. Louis amusement park, approximately 10 miles (16.1 kilometres) from the scene of the accident.
SNT.53069.3533-1	In an interview Saturday, October 21 with Aljazeera.net, Alberto Fernandez, a senior diplomat with the State Department, made the following statement concerning the war in Iraq: "We tried to do our best, but I think there is much room for criticism, because, undoubtedly, there was arrogance and there was stupidity from the United States in Iraq," 
SNT.53069.3533-2	 Fernandez later apologized, "Upon reading the transcript of my appearance on Al-Jazeera, I realized that I seriously misspoke by using the phrase 'there has been arrogance and stupidity' by the U.S. in Iraq."
SNT.118549.3534	Wikileaks has obtained and released a list of all 3,863 websites that are being censored by Danish Internet Service Providers as of February 2008.
SNT.118549.3535	The system is used to filter out child pornography, although Wikileaks points out it "can be used to censor anything" and claims "most sites on the list are still censored (i.e must be on the current list), even though many have clearly changed owners or were possibly even wrongly placed on the list."
SNT.118549.3536	We discussed the unusual leak with them, and the results are published here.
SNT.118549.3537	We asked if Wikileaks was worried about the criminal implications of linking to so much illegal content, but they were not.
SNT.118549.3538	They said that it was "politically untenable" to prosecute them, pointing out that Wikileaks is hosted in many different countries across the globe.
SNT.118549.3539-1	We asked them if they were "concerned about the possibility of censorship in the UK, Denmark, Finland etc.?" 
SNT.118549.3539-2	"No," Wikileaks told us "We welcome it."
SNT.118549.3540	Wikinews wondered if this was because of the Streisand effect, but Wikileaks said it was "because it will demonstrate how censorship systems are abused."
SNT.118549.3541	Wikinews asked Wikileaks why they didn't simply post a list of the sites which they felt were legal and add that all the others contained child porn, but Wikileaks felt "that would not be a fair representation of the material we obtained."
SNT.118549.3542	After seeking clarification, Wikinews was told "the question is not what we need to be told.
SNT.118549.3543	The question is what we need not to be told and who decides.
SNT.118549.3544	Wikinews then asked why they didn't leave the full list available, but mark which sites they felt should not be censored.
SNT.118549.3545	We have better things to do, was the response given.
SNT.118549.3546	It is not so easy to set up merchant accounts."
SNT.118549.3547-1	And what would due process be?
SNT.118549.3547-2	Due process would involve sending a letter to the owner of the merchant account with the accusation and giving them a right to be heard and an appeal process.
SNT.118549.3548	The banks are politically a lot more powerful than the internet industry so this hasn't happened."
SNT.118549.3549-1	And should funds in these accounts be seized straight away, or simply frozen until a judge or similar clears their release?
SNT.118549.3549-2	 "If the accounts are in-jurisdiction, they should be frozen and released or not at the end of the process.
SNT.118549.3550	There are plenty of existing mechanisms to do this for drug trafficking, for example."
SNT.118549.3551	Wikileaks then added "As an analogy, one might argue that everyone should have a loaded gun in the house to protect themselves against home invasions.
SNT.118549.3552	This seems perfectly reasonable; however experience has shown that once the gun is in the house, it will find other targets."
SNT.32410.3553	A class action suit has been filed on Tuesday by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) against the telecom giant AT&T.
SNT.32410.3554	The suit, filed in San Francisco, alleges that AT&T violated federal laws by collaborating with government to eavesdrop on U.S. citizens.
SNT.32410.3555	The Bush Administration and NSA have come under fire over the issue.
SNT.32410.3556	They defend the program by saying they are only listening in on suspected terrorists.
SNT.32410.3557	The EFF claims that AT&;T turned over 2 databases consisting of their subscribers' communication and internet usage records.
SNT.32410.3558	Attorney Kevin Bankston representing the EFF said the government could not conduct their surveillance without the help of companies like AT&T.
SNT.32410.3559	He also said their goal is to tell AT&T that it is not in their fiscal best interests, along with not being legal, to cooperate with the President's wiretap program.

SNT.66778.3563	New reports have emerged detailing the extent of the efforts by the Iranian government to purge Western cultural influence in Iran that is deemed un-Islamic.
SNT.66778.3564	Based on Iran's Islamic Sharia law, non-compliance results in legal punishment because the state sees itself responsible in executing punishment for Islamic theological sins.
SNT.66778.3565	Newspaper headlines such as "Western hairstyles ... have been banned" re-iterated the legal status of Western hairstyles; barbers who offer to what officials consider un-Islamic hairdos, provide make-up services, and pluck eyebrows have been warned that they can face month-long suspension or revocation of their licenses.

SNT.27794.3572	Microsoft has launched its much-hyped Xbox 360 console into Japan, but unlike the European and American markets the Japanese are not rushing out to buy them.
SNT.27794.3573	When launched in the American and European markets, stores sold out early.
SNT.27794.3574	One store-owner says that fewer than 50 units were sold in the first 2 hours of its release.
SNT.27794.3575	Many believe that in Japan it is difficult for any games console to be successful that isn't from a Japanese company, such as Sony or Nintendo.
SNT.27794.3576	The first generation of Xbox consoles performed similarly possibly due to being released two years after the PlayStation 2.
SNT.27794.3577	The large size of the console and the differing style of games was also said to have contributed.
SNT.101852.3578	Members of Australia's Health Services Union (HSU) will go on strike in Victoria next week in a dispute over stalled wage and career structure negotiations.
SNT.101852.3579	Over 5000 physiotherapists, speech pathologists and radiation therapists will walk off the job next week, effectively closing the state's 68 largest health services.
SNT.101852.3580	The strike will force the closure of intensive care units and emergency departments across the state.
SNT.101852.3581	National secretary of the HSU, Kathy Jackson said admissions would be crippled, while intensive care patients would have to be evacuated to New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia as hospitals will not be able to perform tests or administer treatment.
SNT.101852.3582	When an ambulance shows up you can't admit a patient without an X-ray being available, you can't intubate them and you can't operate on them, she said.
SNT.101852.3583	If something goes wrong in an ICU you need to be able to X-ray, use nuclear medicine or any diagnostic procedure, said Ms Jackson.
SNT.101852.3584	Ms Jackson said the HSU offered arbitration last year, but the state government refused.
SNT.101852.3585	They're not interested in settling disputes, they hope that we are just going to go away.
SNT.101852.3586	We're not going away, we've gone back and balloted the whole public health workforce in Victoria, those ballots were successful, 97 percent approval rating, she said.
SNT.101852.3587	The HSU is urging the government to commence serious negotiations to resolve the dispute before industrial action commenced.
SNT.101852.3588	The government has offered the union a 3.25 per cent pay increase, in line with other public sector workers but the union has demanded more, but stopped short of specifying a figure.
SNT.101852.3589	Victorian Premier John Brumby said the claim would be settled according to the government's wages policy.
SNT.101852.3590	The Government is always willing and wanting to sit down and negotiate with the relevant organisations .
SNT.101852.3591	we have a wages policy based around an increase of 3.25 per cent and, above that, productivity offset, he told parliament.
SNT.101852.3592	The union claims it is also arguing against a lack of career structure, which has caused many professionals to leave the health service.
SNT.101852.3593	Ms Jackson said wages and career structures in Victoria were behind other states.
SNT.101852.3594	Victorian Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu said he was not in support of the proposed strike and called on the government to meet with unions.
SNT.101852.3595	There could not be a more serious threat to our health system than has been announced today.
SNT.101852.3596	We now have to do whatever is possible to stop this strike from proceeding, he said.
SNT.101852.3597	The opposition leader will meet with the union at 11:30 AM today.
SNT.101852.3598	Victorian Hospitals Industry Association industrial relations services manager Simon Chant said hospitals were looking at the possible impact and warned that patients may have to be evacuated interstate if the strike goes ahead.

SNT.123935.3606	An act signed into law by Afghan President Hamid Karzai last month dramatically rolled back the rights of women in that country, according to human rights groups and a United Nations report on the bill by the United Nations Development Fund for Women.
SNT.123935.3607	The Afghan government has not provided a copy of the text of the Shia Family Law to the UN or to other outside groups requesting it, citing "technical problems", however, the UN and opposition politicians say that the bill contains numerous provisions restricting the rights of women, such as giving their husbands priority in court; requiring the husband's permission to leave the house, obtain education or employment, or to see a doctor; and reserving the custody of children to male relatives.
SNT.118771.3608	The Belgian parliament on Friday approved the new Van Rompuy I Government consisting of the same five political parties that formed the last ruling coalition, temporarily ending the country's political crisis.
SNT.118771.3609	Lower house deputies approved the Motion of Confidence by a majority of 88 votes to 45, with no abstentions.
SNT.118771.3610	Don't judge the government... by its intentions but by its results, but no results in the very short-term, judge us in 2011, Van Rompuy told the lawmakers.
SNT.118771.3611	In his declaration, he urged the passage of bills to rejuvenate an ailing economy heading into deep recession and sought to resolve the 18 months political crisis after the country spent over nine months in caretaker rule.
SNT.118771.3612	He also asked for full restoration of confidence amid the near-collapse of the country’s two largest banks.
SNT.118771.3613	The previous government proposed such a plan (pumping 2 billion euros or $2.84 billion, into the economy next year, part of a 200 billion euro EU-wide stimulus package).
SNT.118771.3614	It must be enacted as soon as possible, Van Rompuy said.
SNT.118771.3615	It is clear that in the coming weeks and months the government will take new initiatives to cope with the challenges that the crisis poses for the economy and employment, he added.
SNT.118771.3616	Van Rompuy, age 61, is a conservative Belgian Flemish politician and member of the CD&V (formerly called CVP) who succeeds Yves Leterme.
SNT.118771.3617	On December 28, 2008, he was asked by King Albert II to form a new Government after he was reluctant to take up the role of Prime Minister after the Leterme I government had fallen on 22 December 2008 due to the bank bailout scandal.
SNT.118771.3618	The Van Rompuy I Government became the new federal government of Belgium on December 30.
SNT.118771.3619	Eighteen of the 22 ministers served in the same posts in Prime Minister Yves Leterme's government.
SNT.118771.3620	Prime Minister Yves Leterme offered the resignation of his government on December 18 to King Albert after a crisis erupted surrounding the sale of troubled Fortis bank to BNP Paribas.
SNT.118771.3621	Leterme, Justice Minister Jo Vandeurzen, and Didier Reynders were accused of violating the separation of powers and exerting improper influence by trying to influence the Court of Appeals; this accusation was made by the First Chairman of the Court of Cassation.
SNT.118771.3622	Three days later the resignation was accepted by the king.
SNT.118771.3623	Meanwhile, the Flemish opposition led by Flemish nationalist NVA party, Jan Jambon, challenged the legitimacy of Van Rompuy's government, calling it "a government which does not represent a majority of the Flemish people".
SNT.118771.3624	Other opposition parties also questioned the created "Fortisgate" parliamentary commission of enquiry alleging it was a scheme to acquit Leterme.
SNT.118771.3625	It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts its headquarters, as well as those of other major international organizations, including NATO.

SNT.335883.3629	Art thieves in Greece broke into the Athens National Gallery on Monday and stole three valuable works of art.
SNT.335883.3630	Among them was a painting by famous Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, dated 1939, called Woman's Head which was a gift to the Greek people for their resistance to the Nazis during World War 2.
SNT.335883.3631	The other two works were Mill by Piet Mondrian and a sketch of St. Diego de Alcala by Guglielmo Caccia.
SNT.335883.3632	A fourth painting, Landscape, also by Piet Mondrian was dropped by the thieves when pursued by security.
SNT.335883.3633	The police stated multiple alarms during the evening of the heist in other parts of the building had distracted the gallery guard.
SNT.335883.3634	Investigating yet another alarm, he saw the shadow of a fleeing individual.
SNT.335883.3635	Citizen's Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis apologized for the loss, citing that the security at the gallery was "non-existent".
SNT.335883.3636	The value of the works stolen was not yet determined by gallery officials.

SNT.15906.3638	A U.S. Army report finds stress is weighing heavily on Iraq War-era troops with 54 percent of soldiers rating their units' morale as low or very low.
SNT.15906.3639	This is better than the comparable figure in a year-earlier Army survey.
SNT.15906.3640	Reportedly, most bothersome to the soldiers was the length of their required stay in Iraq, which was at least 1 year.
SNT.15906.3641	Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that the Army's 12-month requirement is linked to reorganization.
SNT.15906.3642	I've tried to get the Army to look at the length of tours and I think at some point down the road they will, Rumsfeld said.
SNT.125500.3643	Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced today at a news conference that the U.S. has declared a public health emergency in light of the swine flu outbreak.
SNT.125500.3644	The total number of confirmed swine flu cases in the United States stands at 20.
SNT.125500.3645	Secretary Napolitano said that the United States' declaration follows suit with the "standard operating procedure" of such an outbreak to make more government resources available to combat the disease.
SNT.125500.3646	One direct result of the declaration is the government's mobilization of approximately 12 million doses of Tamiflu to locations where the states can quickly access their share of the medication if needed.
SNT.125500.3647	Secretary Napolitano urged residents not to panic saying that the government is issuing a "declaration of emergency preparedness."
SNT.125500.3648	Secretary Napolitano added, "Really that's what we're doing right now.
SNT.125500.3649	We're preparing in an environment where we really don't know ultimately what the size of seriousness of this outbreak is going to be."
SNT.125500.3650	John Brennan, a Homeland Security assistant, added that "at this point, a top priority is to ensure that communication is robust and that medical surveillance efforts are fully activated."
SNT.125500.3651	This afternoon, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reported that 8 students from the St. Francis Prepatory School in Queens, New York have contracted the swine flu.

SNT.125500.3653	Meanwhile, public health officials in Ohio today announced one confirmed case of swine flu in the state.
SNT.125500.3654	Thus far, California has reported 7 confirmed cases of swine flu, while Kansas and Texas have each reported two confirmed cases.
SNT.125500.3655	At the same news conference Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said to expect additional cases of swine flu to be reported in the short term.
SNT.125500.3656	Dr. Besser added that the U.S. could also start seeing cases of the disease where the effects are more dramatic: "We're going to see more severe disease in this country".
SNT.125500.3657	So far, no one in the U.S. has died from swine flu.
SNT.96314.3658	Kenya's new Parliament convened for the first time since the country's disputed December 27 election, but politician's on opposing sides took part in a heated discussion over who would be the new speaker of the party.
SNT.96314.3659	Kenyan opposition politicians argued with followers of re-elected President Mwai Kibaki over how to pick a new parliamentary speaker.
SNT.96314.3660	When a discussion into how the speaker should be decided started, lawmakers with Raila Odinaga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement insisted the election for speaker be held by open ballot; Mr. Kibaki's supporters demanded the vote be secret.
SNT.96314.3661	The discussion took place for over an hour politicians from both sides took part in a discussion where anger was clearly shown, before the two parties decided a secret ballot was acceptable.
SNT.96314.3662	The standing orders are very clear that members will be given a ballot.
SNT.96314.3663-1	Can you show us where it says secret ballot? 
SNT.96314.3663-2	 We went into election with secret ballot, you stole the vote, we cannot trust you anymore, said William Ruto, a senior adviser for Odigna.
SNT.96314.3664	After a first round of voting, the Orange Democratic Movement candidate had a narrow lead, necessitating another ballot.
SNT.96314.3665	If no-one gets two-thirds majority after two rounds the speaker will be elected by a simple majority in the third round.
SNT.96314.3666	It was an argument like that seen in Parliament that has led many Kenyans to say they have felt abandoned by their leaders in the weeks of chaos that followed the December 27 vote.
SNT.109490.3667	The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard has conducted a missile test exercise, in which nine missiles of three different types were launched simultaneously.

SNT.109490.3671	The Iranians have been under international pressure to withraw from their plans of achieving nuclear proficiency, but have rejected putting a hold on their programme and have also been moving forward with their rocketry programme.
SNT.109490.3672	The test is believed to have been a reaction to Israeli and American military exercises, which the Iranian government believed to be training for an attack on facilities related to the Iranian nuclear development programme.
SNT.109490.3673	In addition to these tests, Iran's first indigenous satellite launch attempt, which will place the Omid spacecraft into low Earth orbit, is expected immanently.
SNT.109490.3674	A successful satellite launch would demonstrate that Iran's missiles have global reach.
SNT.109490.3675	The tests have been widely criticised by the international community.
SNT.109490.3676	The British government stated that it "underlines the need for Iran to comply with its international obligations on the nuclear issue", and that the test was "unwelcome".
SNT.109490.3677	The French ministry of defence suggested that "these missile tests can only reinforce the concerns of the international community", and the German government described the exercise as "regrettable".
SNT.109490.3678	The United States government claims that the test was "evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one".
SNT.109490.3679	American presidential candidate John McCain suggested that it justified US proposals to construct a missile defence system in Eastern Europe, whilst his opponent Barack Obama described Iran's missile programme as a "great threat".
SNT.109490.3680	Russia, however called for diplomacy, stating that they believe Iran to be "ready for negotiations", and Israel's Prime Minister issued a statement saying that he had "no desire for conflict or hostilities with Iran".

SNT.82124.3683	Red Star Belgrade opened the scoring in the 16th minute while Miroslav Klose 1st equalizer 4 minutes later.
SNT.82124.3684	Red Star Belgrade took the lead again when Michael Rensing couldn't handle a long distance shot.

SNT.47772.3696	On Friday, volcanic activity decreased to a calm that remained into Saturday evening, but the Ecuadorian Institute for Geophysics warns that a further eruption may be imminent.
SNT.47772.3697	In 1999, after a long period of rest, the volcano started an eruptive process that continues to this day.
SNT.47772.3698	In May 2006 it increased dramatically culminating in violent eruptions on July 14 and August 16.
SNT.476643.3699	After the first, overnight on Tuesday at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, it was reported in a press release by Marussia that she had lost her right eye, and was still in a "critical but stable" condition.
SNT.476643.3700	On Friday, she underwent a second operation, according to Marussia, "a planned procedure that would depend upon the continued stability of Maria’s head injuries, and this morning the medical team were sufficiently happy with her progress to allow the operation to go ahead."
SNT.476643.3701	Subsequent to the operation, her condition was upgraded to "serious but stable".
SNT.476643.3702	Her sister, Isabel de Villota, has thanked both F1 fans and drivers for their response, saying "We remain positive and this is due, in no small part, to the overwhelming expression of love for Maria from every corner of the world."
SNT.476643.3703	Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso was among those expressing his support, dedicating his pole postion in Saturday's qualifying to De Villota.
SNT.476643.3704	Regarding the accident itself, F1 Race Director Charlie Whiting is of the opinion that it was a "one-in-five-million" fluke.
SNT.476643.3705	Despite questions being raised, both about De Villota's experience and the positioning of the truck with which she collided, he has described it as "so unique that it was just incredible bad luck".
SNT.125269.3706	The mayor of San Francisco, California, Gavin Newsom, has announced via Twitter that he will be running for the state's governor in the 2010 elections.
SNT.125269.3707	He will be in the running to replace California's current governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
SNT.125269.3708	Need your help," said Newsom on his official Twitter profile.

SNT.125269.3710	I hope that you will join our campaign that has set out to change California, because I know we can do better.
SNT.125269.3711	We can't afford to keep returning to the same old, tired ideas and expect a different result, says Newsom in his campaign video.
SNT.125269.3712	Newsom promises more green technology, local economic stimulus and universal healthcare.
SNT.125269.3713	His video doesn't mention anything about same-sex marriage, but Newsom is an active opponent of Proposition 8, California's ban on same-sex marriages.
SNT.125269.3714	Newsom has been San Francisco's mayor since 2003 and was re-elected in 2007.
SNT.64658.3715	Everton came from behind to thrash Fulham 4-1 on Friday at Goodison Park.
SNT.64658.3716	Everton had a chance to jump into fifth place in the league ahead of Bolton, while Fulham could have jumped from fifteenth all the way to eleventh, boosting their chances of league survival.
SNT.64658.3717	England international Andy Johnson was paired with 18 year old James Vaughan up front for Everton, while Chris Coleman's Fulham had a full North American strike force through American Bryan McBride and Canadian Thomasz Radzinski.
SNT.64658.3718	The visitors started the game strongly with long range efforts from Rosenior and Smertin, but neither were able to bother Tim Howard in the Everton goal.
SNT.64658.3719	Mikel Arteta was able to trouble Antti Niemi, however, in the Fulham goal, but the Finnish keeper did well to keep the ball out of the bottom corner.
SNT.64658.3720	Carlos Bocanegra then opened Everton wide open as he stole away from the defenders and headed home Simon Davies' cross, giving Fulham the lead after 22 minutes.
SNT.64658.3721	Everton answered back quickly through Lee Carsley after Joleon Lescott's ball found him in the box, and Carsley knocked home the equalizing goal.
SNT.64658.3722	Everton put Fulham on the back foot after their goal, and should have taken the lead when a nice interchange of play between Vaughan and Johnson left Vaughaun all alone on net, but his shot was hit off the post, and bobbled safely to a Fulham defender.
SNT.64658.3723	Everton were then awarded a free kick in the Fulham zone, and Mikel Arteta stepped up to take.
SNT.64658.3724	His outswinging ball was glanced off the head of Alan Stubbs, and it somehow eluded Niemi, as the homeside took the lead.
SNT.64658.3725	Vaughaun would hit the post again several minutes later, but he finally notched his name on the scoresheet just before the break.
SNT.64658.3726	Arteta and Johnson made room on the left side, and Arteta's cross was finished well by the young Vaughan, giving Everton a demanding 3-1 lead.
SNT.64658.3727	After the break, Fulham came out strongly, eager to get back into the match.
SNT.64658.3728	McBride had two good chances from headers, but he was unable to find the net on either.
SNT.64658.3729	Zat Knight then had a chance for Fulham, but the cottagers where again unable to get their attempts on target.
SNT.64658.3730	Vuaghan was soon replaced by fellow youngster Victor Anichebe, and he made a nearly instant impact.
SNT.64658.3731	Anichebee received a pass within the box, and he cooly side-footed the ball hard and low past Niemi, leaving the keeper no chance, and guaranteeing Everton the win on the afternoon.
SNT.64658.3732	Substitute Helguson had two chances in quick succession for Fulham, but it wasn't to be their day, as the cottagers drop dangerously into relegation contention.
SNT.64658.3733	Everton's next match in the league is in only 3 days time against Bolton, who are now in sixth place after the Toffee's win.
SNT.64658.3734	Fulham on the other hand will be facing off with fellow relegation contenders Manchester City at Craven Cottage, and it is looking up to be a true relegation six-pointer.

SNT.236371.3736	The announcement was issued as a preemptive measure in preparation for an expected 6-12 inches of snow Wednesday, although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority claims to be ready for 14 inches.
SNT.236371.3737	Bloomberg explained the meaning of the preemptive announcement by stating: "We recognize that we did not do the job that New Yorkers rightly expect of us in the last storm.
SNT.236371.3738	We intend to make sure that does not happen again."
SNT.236371.3739	Despite declaring an emergency, the mayor said the city would not make the decision to close public schools until 5 AM.
SNT.236371.3740	The city is looking for people to shovel snow off sidewalks and intersections.
SNT.236371.3741	The New York City Housing Authority announced on their Twitter page, "Turn a snow day into a payday.
SNT.236371.3742	The linked page offered $12 an hour to shovel snow for the city.
SNT.77952.3743	West Ham United midfielder Kieron Dyer suffered a suspected broken leg in the Carling Cup tie against Bristol Rovers.
SNT.77952.3744	Dyer, who joined from Newcastle United at the start of this season, was carried off on a stretcher in the first few minutes of the game.
SNT.77952.3745	The 28 year old was injured in a tackle by Joe Jacobson and the game was delayed before he was taken to hospital.
SNT.77952.3746	The Hammers won the match to reach the 3rd Round 2-1 but boss Alan Curbishley said: "It's immaterial.
SNT.77952.3747	You put a strong side out and you wonder why sometimes.
SNT.77952.3748	We are delighted we have got through but after 10 or 15 minutes the game was immaterial.
SNT.77952.3749	Everyone in the dressing room is really down about it."
SNT.32305.3750	The first case of Avian Flu in Iraq was announced today by the country's Health Minister, Abdel Mutalib Mohammed.
SNT.32305.3751	The preliminary result was reportedly from a United States military laboratory in Cairo; the World Health Organisation are expected to seek confirmation of this from a UK laboratory.
SNT.32305.3752	The victim was Shangen Abdul Qader, a 15-year-old girl from the northern Kurdish village of Raniya.
SNT.32305.3753	The death of the girl's uncle is also believed to be under investigation due to him having symptoms that may indicate flu.
SNT.32305.3754	The area of Iraq where the suspected deaths occurred borders Turkey where there have been 12 confirmed cases of which four resulted in death.
SNT.32305.3755	Turkey's last reported victim, Fatma Ozcan, was also aged 15.
SNT.79846.3756	On Friday morning, Finland scrambled an F-18 Hornet fighter jet to intercept a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 strategic airlifter, which had violated Finnish airspace.
SNT.79846.3757	The aircraft ventured about 4.5 kilometers (3 miles) into Finland's airspace near Porvoo over a period of three minutes, according to Finland's defense ministry.
SNT.79846.3758	Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen has stated that Finland would like an explanation from Russia regarding the reasons for its actions, but he has not made an official protest against Russia.
SNT.79846.3759	These kinds of (violations) must not happen, that's our clear message here, Vanhanen said.
SNT.79846.3760	And when they do happen, then they need to be sorted out between the countries in question.
SNT.79846.3761	Vanhanen also stated that he felt it was important the incident was thoroughly investigated because of safety implications incurred if aircraft stray from their designated flight paths.
SNT.79846.3762	Defense Minister Jyri Hakamies confirmed that there would be a diplomatic meeting as a result between Finnish and Russian officials in order to discuss ways of preventing similar violations in the future.
SNT.79846.3763	Russia apologised to Finland last year following a large number of similar incidents over the space of two years, but only after Finland had protested.
SNT.79846.3764	According to officials, such violations as this latest one were still to be expected, due to a combination of international airspace being limited to a narrow strip off the South coast of Finland, and a high level of Russian air force activity over the Gulf of Finland.
SNT.79846.3765	Russia regularly uses the area to fly missions, mostly with strategic airlifters, between Kaliningrad, capital of Kaliningrad Oblast and located between Poland and Lithuania, and St Petersberg in Russia.
SNT.79846.3766	Similar incidents have been recorded in other Baltic states, particularly in Finland's Southern neighbour, Estonia.
SNT.79846.3767	The most serious such incident involved the October 2005 crash of a Russian jet fighter in Lithuania.
SNT.371828.3768	In response to a plan by the English Defence League to hold a march next Saturday, the leader of Tameside Council, Kieran Quinn, has said the council will be requesting that the Home Office ban the EDL from marching through the town of Hyde, near the city of Manchester.
SNT.371828.3769	Councillor Quinn described the EDL as a hate-filled group wishing to come to Hyde to try and incite hatred".
SNT.371828.3770	The EDL march was started in response to an attack on February 4 against two 17-year-old males in Hyde, Daniel Stringer-Price and Kavan Brown.
SNT.371828.3771	The teenagers claim they were attacked by a gang of Asian men, and the police are investigating it as being a racially-motivated crime.
SNT.371828.3772	Daniel's mother, Cheryl Stringer, has said she does not want the EDL rally to be held: "The EDL have decided to do this and it's go nothing to do with us whatsoever.
SNT.371828.3773	It's not going to change anything – it won't make anything better it will just cause more problems."
SNT.371828.3774	Peter Fahy, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said that the police were concerned "that there could be a threat to peace and order".
SNT.371828.3775	Fahy went on: "The attack was an awful crime but I'm not sure we need outsiders coming in, and clearly the fear is that they are just exploiting the situation."
SNT.7536.3776	In a document dated March 30, 2005 by a group calling itself "the 70 million people of Iran," a declaration was issued asking the current government of The Islamic Republic of Iran to "...peacefully surrender the power to its rightful owners..." by June 16 of this year.
SNT.7536.3777	The group's relationship to political parties in Iran is not known.
SNT.7536.3778	It threatens boycotts and blackouts throughout Iran on June 10 if there are no indications the regime intends to comply with its demands.
SNT.7536.3779	Copies of the document have been furnished to the leaders of the EU, Russia, Japan and the United States.
SNT.7536.3780	A separate document to the leaders of the G8 nations asks for their support, and promises armed resistance to the current government of Iran on June 18, 2005 if peaceful remonstrances fail to have their intended effect.
SNT.7536.3781	The source for the translation and dissemination of the documents into English, French and German calls itself the Iran of Tomorrow Movement (IOTM), an exile group operating from Encino, California in the United States.
SNT.7536.3782	The group claims there are "2,195 resistance cells" operating in Iran and abroad.
SNT.173309.3783	The eruption has created a large hole in the glacier, as well as a fissure that is forming under the glacier, which is now around 2 kilometers (1 mi) long.
SNT.173309.3784	People in the area have been evacuated because of massive flooding due to meltwater from the glacier.
SNT.173309.3785	The first evacuations began at about 02.00 local time (03.00 UTC) today, because earthquakes in the area had pointed to an imminent eruption.
SNT.173309.3786	Air traffic is prohibited in a large area around the eruption zone.
SNT.149620.3787	Chemical Ali, as he was known, received a death sentence on January 17, 2010, for ordering the 1988 gas attack on the town of Halabja in northern Iraq; 5,000 people are thought to have died in the assault on the Kurdish area.
SNT.149620.3788	Majid, 68, had also received the death sentence at earlier trials for his part in attacks on Kurds in 1988, for suppressing a revolt by Shia Muslims, and for killing Shia Muslims in Baghdad in 1999.
SNT.149620.3789	He was regarded as one of the most brutal figures in Saddam Hussein's regime, ordering killings of opponents, as well as mass deportations.
SNT.149620.3790	He was captured after the fall of Saddam in 2003.
SNT.149620.3791	According to the government spokesman, "[t]he execution happened without any violations, shouting or cries of joy."
SNT.149620.3792	The Iraqi state television, al-Iraqiya, broadcast images that it says are of the hanging.
SNT.68129.3793	Today Sailors of HMCS York, Cadets of RCSCC 18 Vanguard, Navy League Cadets of NLCC Ark Royal and Air Cadets of 618 Queen City Squadron marched though Downtown Toronto with drums beating, colors flying, and rifles held proudly.
SNT.68129.3794	All this was to mark the Battle of the Atlantic, which was a series of naval battles fought from 1939 to the end of the second world war.
SNT.68129.3795	During the Battle, Canada lost about 2000 Sailors and 762 members of the Royal Canadian Air Force.
SNT.68129.3796	The Parade started out at Nathan Phillips Square, it then marched a short ways to the Cenotaph at Old City hall, where a ceremony was held for the dead and wounded in the Battle of the Atlantic.
SNT.68129.3797	The parade then began again with a snappy left turn and marched along Queen Street West.
SNT.68129.3798	It then wheeled north along Yonge St. to the Naval Club on Hayden Avenue.
SNT.68129.3799	Seen in the photograph below is Lieutenant (Navy) Armstrong, the Executive Officer of RCSCC 18 Vanguard, in the background, are Vanguard cadets.
SNT.68129.3800	There where approximately 130 sailors, sea and air cadets in attendance.
SNT.83876.3801	United Kingdom's most senior traffic police officer faces charges of speeding at 90 mph in a 60 mph speed limit zone (the equivalent of speeding at 144 km/h in a 96 km/h zone).
SNT.83876.3802	The Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police, Meredydd Hughes was allegedly caught speeding on the A5 road near Chirk in north Wales.
SNT.83876.3803	Hughes was caught by a camera that takes photographs of speeding cars.
SNT.83876.3804	He is known as one of the main advocates for nationwide installation of such cameras.
SNT.83876.3805	Hughes is set to appear at Wrexham Magistrates Court on November 21, 2007.
SNT.83876.3806	He faces a £1000 fine and a driving ban if convicted.
SNT.83876.3807	As the head of road policing within the Association of Chief Police Officers, Hughes can be considered the top traffic cop in the UK.
SNT.155778.3808	According to an announcement made by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday, the inflation rate of the United Kingdom measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased to 3.5% in January 2010, an increase of 0.6% from December 2009.
SNT.155778.3809	For the UK, this is the second largest month-on-month inflation rate increase on record.
SNT.155778.3810	The inflation rate for the country has also now reached its highest level since November 2008.
SNT.155778.3811	The causes of this inflation rise include a 70% rise in oil prices, and value added tax recently being increased to 17.5%.
SNT.155778.3812	The headline inflation rate of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) also increased from 2.4% for the month of December 2009 to 3.7% for the month of January 2010.
SNT.155778.3813	Meanwhile, the underlying rate of RPI increased from 3.8% to 4.6% over the same period.
SNT.155778.3814	The British Government has an inflation target of 2%, which was surpassed by more than 1%.
SNT.155778.3815	For this reason, Mervyn King, who is the Governor of the Bank of England has written a required explanatory letter to Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling.
SNT.155778.3816	In the letter, King wrote: "Although it is likely to remain high over the next few months, inflation is more likely than not to fall back to the target in the second half of this year."
SNT.155778.3817	Alistair Darling then wrote a letter in response, which said that the future expectations of the inflation was "subject to some uncertainty" as countries around the world continue to recover from what he called the "deepest downturn in modern times".
SNT.70803.3818	In an unannounced vote yesterday, the Philadelphia City Council in the United States voted 16-1 to endorse the eviction of, and end their lease held in perpetuity with, the local council of the Boy Scouts in Philadelphia.
SNT.70803.3819	The Scouts must pay market rent or leave the building.
SNT.70803.3820	The Cradle of Liberty Council has more than 60,000 members in Philadelphia and Delaware and Montgomery Counties.
SNT.111761.3821	British television celebrity Jade Goody of Big Brother fame has been diagnosed with cervical cancer.
SNT.111761.3822	Goody, 27, arrived in London Heathrow Airport on Tuesday night, having cut short her stay in the Indian version of Celebrity Big Brother, known as Bigg Boss.
SNT.111761.3823	Goody was a controversial character in last year's Big Brother, sparking over 40,000 complaints to Ofcom, the British broadcasting regulator after she allegedly made racist and defamatory remarks to fellow housemate and Indian celebrity Shilpa Shetty.
SNT.111761.3824	Goody has stated she agreed to take part on the Indian version of the show as an attempt to make up for her behaviour last year.
SNT.111761.3825	Shetty is hosting the show, and has stated that her "prayers are with Jade."
SNT.111761.3826	Goody has been accused of making the announcement as a publicity stunt, but her spokesman has dismissed this as "ridiculous".
SNT.111761.3827	Goody has stated she "will worry for [her] boys if [she] get[s] unwell".
SNT.111761.3828	She said that she entered the house, despite undergoing medical tests, because she "can't wait around for the doctors" and that bills need paying.
SNT.111761.3829	Goody is said to have signed a contract worth £100,000 with Bigg Boss before her departure from the show.
SNT.111761.3830	She is expected to undergo medical tests so doctors can see how far the cancer has spread.
SNT.15800.3831	A multi-center US study of 748 patients, who were to undergo treatment for coronary artery disease, has found that prayer by Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Buddhist groups had no measurable effects on the medical health of the study subjects.
SNT.15800.3832	The prayers were conducted by established congregations and were held away from the hospitals.
SNT.15800.3833	The study, published in the 16 July 2005 issue of The Lancet, found that the likelihood of an adverse cardiovascular event in hospital, re-admission or death within six months was unaffected by prayer.
SNT.15800.3834	None of the patients were told that they were prayed for, and none of the prayer groups knew who they prayed for.
SNT.15800.3835	The study also examined the effects of "music, imagery, and touch (MIT) therapy" before heart surgery.
SNT.15800.3836	Practitioners qualified to Level 1 Healing Touch taught the patient relaxation techniques and played soothing music before applying 21 Healing Touch hand positions, over a 40 minute session.
SNT.15800.3837	There was no significant change in the combined chance of an adverse cardiovascular event in hospital, re-admission or death within six months.
SNT.15800.3838	However, while the set of patients was evenly split, only 7 patients who received MIT therapy died, and 20 patients who did not receive it died.
SNT.15800.3839	The result is not highly significant due to the low overall number of people who died.
SNT.15800.3840	A number of studies has recently examined the possible effects of prayer, with mixed results.
SNT.15800.3841	While some religious groups have hailed studies which found positive results , skeptics have challenged the very notion of scientifically examining prayer , and have described past studies as flawed or even fraudulent.
SNT.15800.3842	The mechanisms through which distant intercessory prayer might convey healing benefit are unknown, the authors of the study explain.
SNT.15800.3843	One hypothesis they propose for such effects are "non-local features of consciousness based theoretically around observations in quantum physics."
SNT.47309.3844	The United Nations brokered cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah is largely holding as Israel has begun to withdraw its forces from Lebanon.
SNT.47309.3845	UNSC Resolution 1701, which calls for a "full cessation of hostilities" in the Israeli-Lebanon war, was passed by the UN Security Council last Friday and was approved by Lebanon and Israel over the weekend.
SNT.47309.3846	Lebanon's defence minister, Elias Murr, says that the 15,000 troops Lebanon has committed to the peacekeeping operation will be on the north side of the Litani River by the end of the week.
SNT.47309.3847	As part of the truce agreement, they must cross the river and exercise control over what has been Hezbollah controlled territory in southern Lebanon.
SNT.47309.3848	The head of the Israeli army says the IDF could complete its withdrawal from Lebanon in 7 to 10 days.
SNT.47309.3849	The new international peace-keeping force may number as many as 15,000, significantly larger than the existing force of 2,000, known as UNIFIL, which is expected to take up border positions in the mean time.
SNT.47309.3850	The UN hopes for an advance force of up to 3,500 within the next 10 to 14 days.
SNT.47309.3851	France, who is expected to lead the international force, is seeking a clearer mandate from the UN on the rules of engagement.
SNT.47309.3852	Over 1,200 people have lost their lives in the conflict.
SNT.47309.3853	1,110, mostly civilians, have died in Lebanon and 157 Israelis, mostly military, were killed.
SNT.47309.3854	Israel says it killed 530 Hezbollahh fighters while Hezbollah puts the toll at about 80.
SNT.105849.3855	People studying the situation in Myanmar are claiming that an inadequate response of the government of Myanmar (formerly Burma) to scientists' warnings about the cyclone, coupled with large-scale destruction of protective mangroves along its coasts, aggravated the devastation wreaked by tropical Cyclone Nargis.
SNT.105849.3856	The cyclone has killed an estimated 22,980 people so far, with millions rendered homeless by the disaster, which struck the Irrawaddy Delta region of Myanmar last week (3 May).
SNT.105849.3857	Scientists at the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in New Delhi, theWorld Meteorological Organisation's specialist centre for Asia, say they issued the first of the cyclone bulletins to Myanmar as early as 26 April.
SNT.105849.3858	Mrityunjay Mohapatra, director of IMD's cyclone-warning centre, told SciDev.Net that Myanmar was warned of the impending cyclone at least 48 hours in advance.
SNT.105849.3859	But there was no acknowledgement from Myanmar's meteorological office, or any indication of a response.
SNT.105849.3860	Mohapatra says IMD's first warning bulletin, issued on 1 May, indicated the land area likely to be hit by the cyclone.
SNT.105849.3861	It warned that a cyclone with wind speeds of 180 kilometres per hour would cross the southwest coast of Myanmar sometime between 8pm and midnight on the night of the 2 May.
SNT.105849.3862	IMD's bulletins contain information on the actual and predicted centre, intensity and movement of the cyclone, as well as sea conditions and maximum wind speeds around the cyclone centre.
SNT.105849.3863	Uma Charan Mohanty, from the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre in Thailand, said that, according to the World Meteorological Organisation's data, Asian cyclones are fewer and less intense than hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean or typhoons in the Pacific Ocean region, but they cause more death and destruction.
SNT.105849.3864	In 2005, 25 hurricanes in the Atlantic caused 10 deaths, but cyclone Sidr, which hit Bangladesh in 2007, left 3,500 dead.
SNT.105849.3865	Mohanty says that the Atlantic coast has a good early-warning system and people have the means to drive to safer areas.
SNT.105849.3866	In contrast, Asian coasts are densely populated, with many poor fishing and farming communities who cannot evacuate on their own, even if they have been warned.
SNT.105849.3867	News agencies quote Maung Swe, Myanmar's minister for relief and resettlement, who told a press conference (6 May) that most deaths were caused by a 3.5-metre-high storm surge — a wall of water that develops when cyclonic winds churn up sea water.
SNT.105849.3868	Mohanty says that 85 per cent of cyclone deaths are due to storm surges and that predictions of the size and location of such surges are critical in disaster forecasting.
SNT.105849.3869	Asian coasts are also becoming increasingly vulnerable because of the loss of protective mangrove forests that serve as windbreaks and limit damage by storm and tidal surges.
SNT.105849.3870	In a 2006 report, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that areas in Sri Lanka with mangrove forests suffered less damage in the 2004 Asian tsunami, compared with regions where forests had been destroyed.
SNT.105849.3871	And in January 2008, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warned that Asia is fast losing its coastal mangroves, with more than 1.9 million hectares being destroyed each year.
SNT.105849.3872	The organisation's report reviewed the world's mangroves between 1980 and 2005.
SNT.105849.3873	It found that the mangrove forests around Myanmar's Irrawady Delta had degraded because of "overexploitation" and the conversion of land for rice fields — promoted by the government as a way to ensure self-sufficiency in food production.
SNT.105849.3874	Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.
SNT.105849.3875	Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred.
SNT.105849.3876	At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.
SNT.105849.3877	The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.
SNT.99990.3878	Dutch financial institution ING Group reported today in its quarterly results an impairment charge of €194 million euros (approximately US$285.6 million).
SNT.99990.3879	However, as a result of selling an equity stake in rival ABN AMRO, the net profit of €2.48 billion, was 18% higher than last year.
SNT.99990.3880	The impairment charge is a result of risky investments, including RBMS (mortgage) investments backed by subprime loans and Alt-A loans, which are made to borrowers with a slightly better credit profile than those in the subprime category, as well as from collateral debt obligations (CDOs).
SNT.270995.3881	Modern polar bears are genetically related to an extinct species of Irish brown bear, according to a study published Thursday in Current Biology.
SNT.270995.3882	The two share a distinct genetic marker not present in other brown bears, strongly suggesting that all modern polar bears are descended from the same extinct species.
SNT.270995.3883	The study found evidence of polar bear hybridization with a now-extinct population of brown bears that lived in Ireland and Britain during the last ice age.
SNT.270995.3884	Brown bears are no longer found on the British Isles, and it had been thought that polar bears interbred more recently with brown bears living around Alaska.
SNT.270995.3885	However, the samples used in the analysis came from the past 120,000 years and show that interbreeding of the two species occurred a great deal earlier.
SNT.270995.3886	Climate change is thought to have presented opportunities for the two species to mate now and then in the past 100,000 years.
SNT.270995.3887	The evidence comes from a DNA analysis of fossil bones collected from the teeth and bones of seventeen bears from eight Irish caves.
SNT.270995.3888	Ten Irish brown bears from between 10,000 and 38,000 years ago carried a distinct sequence of mitochondrial DNA, originating from a specific female brown bear, and this DNA sequence has been passed down the female polar bear line and is found in all polar bears today.
SNT.270995.3889	Fossils from the last species of ancient brown bears in Ireland, living from 3,000 to 5,000 years ago, have a different genetic fingerprint, matching neither that of polar bears nor of modern brown bears.
SNT.270995.3890	A member of the international team conducting the study, Dr Ceiridwen Edwards from Oxford University, said: "Hybridisation between ancient Irish brown bears and polar bears has led to the complete replacement of the original polar bear mitochondria.
SNT.270995.3891	This maternal lineage is now present in all modern polar bears."
SNT.270995.3892	The authors of the paper conclude that their evidence shows that matrilineal history of brown and polar bears suggest that "a likely genetic exchange with extinct Irish brown bears forms the origin of the modern polar bear matriline."
SNT.270995.3893	They suggest that hybridization may be more common than previously recognized and may be a way species deal with loss of their habitats when the environment is changing.
SNT.114905.3894	In Wikinews' attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the 2008 Canadian federal election, Wikinews has talked via email with Jo-Anne Boulding.
SNT.114905.3895	The riding's Conservative incumbent is Tony Clement, Minister of Health and Minister for FedNor.
SNT.114905.3896	Other candidates in the riding are Liberal Jamie McGarvey, Green Glen Hodgson, and independent David Rowland.
SNT.114905.3897	The following is an interview with Ms. Boulding, conducted via email, over a week ago.
SNT.114905.3898-1	She did not respond to two of the main questions: “Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?” and “What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?”
SNT.114905.3898-2	 Being unanswered, these questions were edited out of the interview, which otherwise is published as received.
SNT.78857.3899	Freelance journalist, Gabriel Pollard, spoke to Joe Stewart and David Farrar about the new anti-spam legislation in New Zealand that comes into effect today.
SNT.78857.3900	Joe Stewart is the Unit Manager of the Department of Internal Affairs new Anti-Spam Compliance Unit, and David Farrar is Chair of InternetNZ’s Public Policy Committee, who also had significant input into the final bill.
SNT.78857.3901	Keith Norris, CEO of the New Zealand Marketing Association, didn't respond to multiple requests for an interview.
SNT.78857.3902	The anti-spam legislation, or the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007, promotes spam education and awareness and will enable international agencies to work together to share information and will enable cross-border pursuit of serious law breakers.
SNT.78857.3903	And it doesn't just cover e-mail spam, but all electronic messaging such as SMS/text messaging, etc.
SNT.78857.3904-1	However, New Zealand isn't the most up-to-date country with implementing similar legislation, Farrar says, “We are in fact almost the last country in the OECD to have such legislation.” 
SNT.78857.3904-2	He urges Eastern Europe and China to take part in the fight against spam.
SNT.78857.3905	Stewart said that the new law would only help combat a small amount of spam, as 99%-99.9% of all spam received originates from overseas.
SNT.78857.3906	He says the legislation alone will not solve the problem.
SNT.78857.3907	As well as it helping to fight New Zealand-sourced spam and preventing New Zealand from “becoming a haven for spammers”, it will promote good practices within the e-marketing community, Stewart said.
SNT.78857.3908	The new Act will affect legitimate marketers in New Zealand by making sure they have expressed or inferred consent to continue sending marketing messages to people on their database.
SNT.78857.3909	Inferred consent is where the marketers have the e-mail address and send messages to those on their database, but didn't get expressed consent to send messages.
SNT.78857.3910	Stewart does issue a warning against using inferred consent saying, “They may have been sending these people messages for years, but this does not establish consent.”
SNT.78857.3911	A surge in emails has also been felt with companies/marketers making sure they have consent to continue the e-mails and asking those to confirm they wish to continue their subscription.
SNT.78857.3912	“However, many marketers are already fulfilling these requirements because they are standard good e-marketing practice,” Stewart said.
SNT.78857.3913	Due to legislative requirements, as well as having consent, businesses will have to provide details about the company sending the item, and provide a free way to unsubscribe from future mailings.
SNT.78857.3914	Those found breaking these requirements deliberately could find themselves facing a personal fine of up to NZ$200,000.
SNT.78857.3915	Farrar said, “Experience from Australia shows most cases are dealt with by way of education.”
SNT.78857.3916	Farrar also gives a final piece of advice to those annoyed with spam levels, “Never ever respond to a spam e-mail, and only give your real address out to people you trust.”
SNT.104333.3917	Eleven people have died after a military helicopter crashed during an anti-narcotics flight in Western Mexico.
SNT.104333.3918	Michoacan is a major area in Mexico's anti-narcotics operations, which are conducted by the nation's military.
SNT.104333.3919	Police cordoned off the scene and forensic officers have moved in to examine the site.
SNT.104333.3920	There are 11 men dead, including a colonel, and one soldier was injured, said a state attorney general's office spokesman.
SNT.104333.3921	The wounded soldier, who was the sole survivor, was flown to a Mexico City military hospital, and remains there in a serious condition.
SNT.104333.3922	Although authorities released no crash details, witnesses say the helicopter lost power during attempts to land.
SNT.104333.3923	The motor stopped and the helicopter plummeted to the ground, said one local resident named Agustin Vargas.
SNT.104333.3924	The flight had been headed to a marijuana field with the intention of raiding it.
SNT.6633.3925	In mainland China, the China Daily published an editorial under the headline, "March sets stage for secessionist scheming" in which it labeled the rally as "secessionist scheming" and a "misuse of people power".
SNT.6633.3926	China Daily said of President Chen that, "his participation in the protest added to his record as a man of bad faith.
SNT.6633.3927	Only one month ago, Chen solemnly pledged to develop cross-Straits relations during his meeting with PFP chairman James Soong.
SNT.6633.3928	The Taipei Times quoted Lee, "The March 26 march ended perfectly, yet it wasn't just the close of a political carnival."
SNT.6633.3929	Lee continued, "It was a new starting point for consolidating people's identification with Taiwan and declaring the Taiwanese people's strong will to defend their right of self-determination."
SNT.6633.3930	That 1 million Taiwanese people came out was a display of the mainstream of Taiwanese public opinion, and officials should respond to that with practical actions and policies, Lee told a symposium.
SNT.6633.3931	Otherwise the march will just have been emotional venting, which won't solve the current [cross-strait] problems.
SNT.48398.3932	After being held for more than four years at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, German born Turkish citizen Murat Kurnaz was transferred to German custody by U.S. authorities on Thursday.
SNT.48398.3933	Kurnaz was picked up in Pakistan in 2001 when riding a bus.
SNT.48398.3934	He was first transferred to a prison camp in Afghanistan and then transferred to Guantanamo bay.
SNT.48398.3935	He was designated an "enemy combatant" even after German law enforcement and US intelligence officials concluded that there was no information tying him to al-Qaeda or other terrorist activities.
SNT.48398.3936	Kurnaz's lawyers have charged that Kurnaz was tortured while being held in Afghanistan and - to a lesser degree - while at Guantanamo Bay.
SNT.48398.3937	Even on the flight back to Germany Kurnaz was shackled on hand and feet, tied to the ground and blindfolded.
SNT.48398.3938	Pentagon spokesman Chito Peppler said that the conditions for the prisoner transfer of Kurnaz to Germany included guarantees that Kurnaz be treated humanely by German authorities and that Germany take steps to ensure Kurnaz would not pose any threat to the world.
SNT.119151.3939	Late on Thursday the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
SNT.119151.3940	Only the United States abstained because of the view that Hamas was committed to violence.
SNT.119151.3941	Fighting has continued since the resolution, and yesterday Israel warned of increased military action.
SNT.119151.3942	The death toll from the first 13 days of the Israeli offensive was 770 Palestinians and 14 Israelis.
SNT.119151.3943	US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has given an explanation for why the United States abstained and did not veto the resolution.
SNT.119151.3944	...But after a great deal of consideration, we decided that this resolution, the text of which we support, the goals of which we support, and the objectives that we fully support, should indeed be allowed to go forward.
SNT.119151.3945	I believe in doing so, the council has provided a roadmap for a sustainable, durable peace in Gaza.
SNT.119151.3946	Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki has commented that the resolution was still a disappointment.
SNT.119151.3947	To tell you the truth, we have really expected that all countries would vote in favor.
SNT.119151.3948	But we are really satisfied with the outcome so far.
SNT.119151.3949	What really concerns us the most is the immediate applicability of the resolution on ground.
SNT.119151.3950	We fear, and we have reasons to do so, that Israel will delay its acceptance and implementation of the cease-fire for few hours, if not few days.
SNT.119151.3951	Israel continued to drop warning leaflets and send phone messages to Gaza residents, with one phone message on Saturday saying that the "third stage" of their operation will begin soon.
SNT.119151.3952	United Nations aid agency UNRWA resumed aid shipments yesterday, after halting them on Thursday citing safety risks.
SNT.51874.3953	Ferrari driver Felipe Massa and his teammate Michael Schumacher won the front row on the FIA Formula-1 2006 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix on the Suzuka International Racing Course.
SNT.51874.3954	On the dying minutes of the qualification Massa suddenly overtook the seven times world champion thus winning the pole for the red team.
SNT.51874.3955	Ralf Schumacher's Toyota amazed Japanese fans, showed third result, followed by the other Toyota of Jarno Trulli.
SNT.51874.3956	Renault drivers Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisicella classified after him.
SNT.51874.3957	Not a bad result for another Japanese team - Honda drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello on the fourth line of the grid.
SNT.106006.3958	Wikinews has learned that the Wikimedia Foundation has decided not to participate in a panel discussion that is to take place at Santa Clara University in California.
SNT.106006.3959	The discussion, which is titled 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' was to be based on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia and ethics involved in the editing of the website.
SNT.106006.3960	It is the ninth such meeting in a series on technology, ethics, and law and is taking place today.
SNT.106006.3961	In an e-mail to Wikinews, Miriam Schulman the communications director for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University which is to host the discussion, states that Mike Godwin, legal counsel for the Foundation, will not be speaking during the discussion as was originally planned.
SNT.106006.3962	According to Schulman, Godwin canceled his scheduled appearance just one week ago and has decided not to have anyone from the foundation replace him.
SNT.106006.3963	Valleywag, a gossip website about technology, recently reported that Godwin was not attending due to a "groundswell of criticism of Wikipedia".
SNT.106006.3964	I don't want to speak for Mr. Godwin or Wikimedia, but someone else made an incorrect assumption about this, so let me clarify that in our understanding, the problem was never with the composition of the panel.
SNT.106006.3965	Mike Godwin, General Counsel of Wikimedia, was scheduled to participate in the panel, 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' on May 15.
SNT.106006.3966	 Last week, Mr. Godwin informed us that he would not participate, and subsequent discussions with Wikimedia Foundation indicated that they would not designate a replacement speaker, stated Schulman to Wikinews.
SNT.106006.3967	This is our ninth such panel (in addition to the hundreds of events on other topics our centers run each year), and we feel confident in our ability to set a respectful tone for discourse on controversial topics, added Schulman.
SNT.106006.3968	Schulman would not comment on the reason for the Foundation's decision.
SNT.106006.3969	Wikinews also attempted to contact Godwin, but was directed to Jay Walsh who is the head of communications for the Foundation, but Wikinews has not received a response.
SNT.106006.3970	The panel was to include Carl Hewitt an electrical and computer science engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Godwin discussing Wikipedia with Pedro Hernández-Ramos, associate director for the Center for Science, Technology, and Society moderating the discussion.
SNT.106006.3971	The plan was to discuss Wikipedia, and what does and doesn't work for the encyclopedia.
SNT.106006.3972	This panel will explore what works and what doesn't in the Wikipedia editing model from the angles of ethics, expertise, education, and the law, said a statement on the Center's website.
SNT.106006.3973	Schulman states that the discussion, which is open to the public, is "still planned" for Thursday May 15 at 6:00 p.m. (pacific time) at the De Saisset Museum on the university's campus, but it is not yet known if anyone outside the Foundation will be replacing Godwin.
SNT.106006.3974	The High Tech Law Institute along with the Ethics Center are sponsoring the discussion.
SNT.106006.3975	These events are always open to the public, which means everyone is welcome.
SNT.106006.3976	In this kind of setting, we invite anyone with an interest in the topic, stated Schulman to Wikinews.
SNT.106006.3977	The Foundation is the parent organization of Wikipedia and other projects such as Wikinews and Wikimedia Commons, a Wiki dedicated to hosting images that can be used throughout the projects of the Foundation.
SNT.198553.3978	Jurors in the Rod Blagojevich corruption trial began their fifth day of deliberations this morning, having sent no notes to the judge at all yesterday.
SNT.198553.3979	Notes they sent out last week, however, suggest that the discussions could take much longer.
SNT.198553.3980	The jury has sent two notes to US District Judge James B. Zagel since deliberations began last Wednesday.
SNT.198553.3981	The first came on Thursday, when the jury requested a transcript of one of the prosecution's closing arguements.
SNT.198553.3982	The second note came on Friday, when the foreman wrote "Is it permissible to obtain the transcript of the testimony? It would be helpful."
SNT.198553.3983	Zagel interpreted the request as saying that the jury wanted transcripts of the testimony of every single witness in the trial.
SNT.198553.3984	Zagel again declined the request because it was not practical to do so; about 30 witnesses testified in this case, and the transcripts have not yet been prepared.
SNT.198553.3985	Zagel instead offered to consider requests for transcripts of testimony from "specific identified witnesses", but said that he would warn the jury that such requests could take some time to fulfill.
SNT.198553.3986	Defense attorney Sheldon Sorosky objected to this plan, saying that "the government will have the benefit of presenting its case a whole second time."
SNT.198553.3987	Zagel said in reply that he would still consider each of the jury's requests individually.
SNT.198553.3988	Such a request, however, suggests that the jury intends to conduct a lengthy review of the case.
SNT.198553.3989	The six male and six female jurors continued their deliberations on Monday without sending any further notes to the judge.
SNT.36726.3990	The new book Game of Shadows: Barry Bonds, BALCO, and the Steroids Scandal that Rocked Professional Sports, by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams of The San Francisco Chronicle, is being released today.
SNT.36726.3991	The authors not only implicate professional baseball celebrity Barry Bonds in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, but also say Gary Sheffield received human growth hormone and testosterone from Greg Anderson, Bonds's personal trainer.
SNT.36726.3992	The book goes on to claim that Jason Giambi also took performance-enhancing drugs from Anderson.
SNT.36726.3993	Bonds continues to insist that he did not realize his trainer was giving him steriods.
SNT.36726.3994	He claimed in his grand jury testimony that he thought he was receiving flaxseed oil and an arthritis salve.
SNT.36726.3995	Sheffield's response to the claims was quite simple: when asked if the allegations made against him were true, his response was "Nope."
SNT.36726.3996-1	Despite the book's accusations of Sheffield and Giambi, it centers around Bonds and the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative or BALCO, Victor Conte Jr. 
SNT.36726.3996-2	Conte is currently serving four months in prison for distribution of steriods and money laundering.
SNT.36726.3997	It appears that the steroid controversy concerning Bonds will only intensify as he continues to march on towards the career home runs record, one of baseball's most sacred records.
SNT.150475.3998	A sixteen-year-old girl, Darlene Etienne, was pulled out from underneath the rubble of a collapsed school in Haiti yesterday, fifteen days after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck the country, devastating most buildings in the capital, Port-au-Prince.
SNT.150475.3999	Etienne had been studying at school in the capital when the tremors starｔed, collapsing the building.
SNT.150475.4000	She had apparently survived by drinking water from a bathroom, and the Al Jazeera news agency reports rescuers had heard her mumbling something about having some Coca-Cola.
SNT.150475.4001	When pulled from the rubble, she was reportedly dehydrated, but happy.
SNT.150475.4002	Etienne was taken to a French-run field hospital, and later to a hospital ship moored off the Haitian coast for further treatment.
SNT.150475.4003	She just said 'Thank you', she's very weak, which suggests that she's been there for 15 days, said the head of the rescue team that recovered the girl, Samuel Bernes, noting that she was located "in a pocket, surrounded by concrete".
SNT.150475.4004	She couldn't really talk to us or say how long she'd been there but I think she'd been there since the earthquake.
SNT.150475.4005	I don't think she could have survived even a few more hours, rescuer Claude Fuilla told the Associated Press.
SNT.150475.4006	I don't know how she happened to resist that long, said another rescue worker, JP Malaganne, as quoted by the BBC.
SNT.150475.4007	It all happened very quickly, but rescue teams managed to get her out and she was covered in layers of dust and concrete, said Jonah Hull, a correspondent for Al Jazeera, describing the rescue effort as being "a delicate process".
SNT.150475.4008	Five days ago, the Haitian government officially ended its search for living people under the rubble; upwards of 130 people have been rescued from underneath the remains of collapsed buildings.
SNT.3085.4009	The infected cow was found in the province of Alberta, where two previous cases of BSE have been reported in the past year.
SNT.3085.4010	The cow itself was born in March of 1998, mere months after a ban placed by the CFIA to stop the use of any feed which might contain any "specified risk material"-- material that is known to carry the BSE agent.
SNT.3085.4011	The CFIA is now in control of the carcass and makes clear that no part of the cow has entered the food supply.
SNT.3085.4012	A team of experts from the United States have been sent to re-evaluate the situation and to make recommendations about reopening the U.S. border.
SNT.3085.4013	The border was closed to beef exports after the first incident of BSE was reported in Canada.
SNT.3085.4014	The closure continues to cause major problems for Canadian beef farmers who depended on the United States beef market.
SNT.33637.4015	The Australian House of Representatives have considered the bill regarding whether the Australian Health Minister Tony Abbott, or the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) regulate the abortifacient mifepristone (RU486), and has passed the bill unamended.
SNT.33637.4016	Earlier today, the Prime Minister John Howard (Australian Liberal Party, Bennelong) has spoken on the amendments earlier proposed by Jackie Kelly (Liberal, Lindsay) and Andrew Laming (Liberal, Bowman), speaking in favour of the Laming amendments and reiterating his support for Abbott, stating that he is the "best friend that Medicare ever had", Abbott's usual phrase he states in Question Time in support of the Government's handling of Medicare.
SNT.33637.4017	Howard's counterpart, the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley (Australian Labor Party, Brand), spoke in support of the bill in its unamended form, noting that it is "simply commonsense that the minister does not have the scientific capacity" to evaluate the drug, and reiterating that the bill is "not really about Tony Abbott".
SNT.33637.4018	More controversially he however said that those with certain personal views such as Tony Abbott's conservative Catholic faith should not hold certain offices in Government, which drew criticism from the Government later in the debate noting that an earlier Labor Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin's pacificism was a strong wartime leader.
SNT.33637.4019	Later, the Kelly amendments were put to the vote and were lost on the voices and in subsequent division with 49 agreeing to the amendments and 96 disagreeing.
SNT.33637.4020	The vote on whether the bill should be read a second time 95 for to 50 against.
SNT.33637.4021	In the consideration in detail stage, the Laming amendments were debated, but the vote on these amendments were lost with 56 supporting the amendments and 90 against them.
SNT.33637.4022	The bill as unamended was agreed to and passed the third reading on the voices, without having to resort to a vote.
SNT.11669.4023	Organizers of the upcoming London Live 8 concert have announced that legendary rock band Pink Floyd plans to perform on July 2.
SNT.11669.4024	Guitarist David Gilmour, bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and keyboardist Richard Wright will play their first performance together since playing at Earls Court, London in 1981.
SNT.11669.4025	The band will come together, along with other musical acts such as Coldplay, Elton John, and Paul McCartney for this event.
SNT.11669.4026	Live 8 is a series of free concerts at each of the G8 nations organized by Bob Geldof.
SNT.11669.4027	These concerts, set on the 20th anniversary of Geldof's Live Aid, have been planned to support the Make Poverty History campaign, which aims to reduce African poverty.
SNT.11669.4028	This lineup of Pink Floyd has not played together for 24 years due to a conflict between David Gilmour and Roger Waters over leadership and creative influence of the band.
SNT.11669.4029	However, it seems that they are willing to put their differences behind to support Live 8; "Like most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the G8 leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world," said David Gilmour and added, "Any squabbles Roger and the band have had in the past are so petty in this context, and if reforming for this concert will help focus attention then it's got to be worthwhile."
SNT.84806.4030	A 1.5m tidal surge is expected tonight in the United Kingdom and could lead to flooding on the Kent coast, according to the UK Met Office.
SNT.84806.4031	The surge is expected to cause "severe" flooding and the Thames Barrier was closed at 2000 UTC.
SNT.84806.4032	The Environment Agency have said that there is "extreme danger to life and property" and have evacuated 200 people on the coast.
SNT.84806.4033	1,300 properties are thought to be in the affected area.
SNT.84806.4034	The Environment agency representative said that they would have extra staff available to inform the public of the risks but are also asking people to check that others are aware of the potential risks, especially to the elderly.
SNT.84806.4035	The surge has been caused by the high wind speeds of over 80 miles per hour, and could be over hurricane force, high tides and low pressure over the North Sea.
SNT.84806.4036	There are currently 42 flood warnings of various degrees, eight of which are rated severe.
SNT.84806.4037	North Sea oil platforms are being evacuated in advance of the storm.
SNT.84806.4038	BP is expecting to shut down the production on its North Sea oil platforms on Thursday.
SNT.84806.4039	At the same time, Conoco Inc. has announced, that they will evacuate around 500 staff oil from platforms at the Ekofisk oil field.
SNT.84806.4040	The METAR reports from Ekofisk Oil Platform are indicating continuously intensifying winds.
SNT.84806.4041	At 11:50 UTC on Thursday, wind gusts of 57 knots were reported
SNT.464694.4042	Earlier today, the Australian Institute of Sport and Swimming Australia cancelled a team meeting for the Australian Stingers and a Swimming Australia Grand Prix event scheduled for this weekend after two Olympic bound water polo players, Melissa Rippon and Nicola Zagame, were diagnosed with whooping cough.
SNT.464694.4043	Both players are receiving treatment administered by the Australian Institute of Sport.
SNT.464694.4044	In a statement issued by Water Polo Australia, they said "Water Polo Australia is taking this very seriously and will continue to work closely with AIS health professionals to provide the best care for those players diagnosed and to reduce any potential further risk".
SNT.464694.4045	For Australia's Olympic bound swimmers, their coaches are expected to arrange alternative training ahead of their leaving for Europe.
SNT.464694.4046	In a statement released by Olympic swimming head coach Leigh Nugent, he said, "Originally we'd planned to have this camp as an opportunity to come together for some further relay preparation and the chance for some of the athletes to race and time trial, a month or so out from the Games.
SNT.464694.4047	From a relay perspective we are confident we're on track with our preparations and will fine-tune things when we get to Manchester in July."
SNT.464694.4048	Rippon and Zagame are expected to be recovered next week and should be ready for London.
SNT.17873.4049	Robin Cook, the former British foreign secretary and current Member of Parliament, has died of a suspected heart attack after collapsing on a walk with his wife on Ben Stack hill, Scotland.
SNT.17873.4050	Cook, aged 59, was flown to a hospital in Inverness by a rescue service helicopter half an hour after collapsing.
SNT.17873.4051	A spokesperson for NHS Highland said that Mr. Cook arrived at hospital 90 minutes after his collapse, and was reported dead five minutes later.
SNT.17873.4052	A postmortem examination has concluded that he died from hypertensive heart disease.
SNT.17873.4053	Mr. Cook was buried on August 12 at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh in a service attended by close family, friends and political figures from across the world.
SNT.17873.4054	British Prime Minister Tony Blair however came under attack from Mr. Cooks friend and racing pundit John McCririck for his absence from the service.
SNT.17873.4055	Robin Cook served as Foreign Secretary under New Labour and was a critic of the war in Iraq.
SNT.17873.4056	He resigned as Leader of the House of Commons in 2003 in protest against Prime Minister Blair's foreign policies.
SNT.724454.4057	The US Senate rejected Wednesday a bill amendment aimed at increasing the security of gun background checks, on what President Barack Obama described as "a shameful day for Washington."
SNT.724454.4058	On April 10 Senator Pat Toomey, accompanying Senator Joe Manchin in announcing the amendment, said it aimed to make "it more difficult for criminals and mentally ill people to obtain guns".
SNT.724454.4059	The amendment would expand checks to sales online and at gun shows.
SNT.724454.4060	The vote followed weeks of campaigning by the President, who was supported by a speech by Michelle Obama describing his proposed measures as "common sense."
SNT.724454.4061	The bill received only 54 of the required 60 votes to proceed, despite strong public support for tighter gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting last year.
SNT.724454.4062	Gun rights groups have campaigned strongly against the vote, claiming that the measures would violate constitutional rights, and targeting individual Senators with mocking material appearing online.
SNT.724454.4063	Other proposed amendments to the bill which endeavoured to ban the sale of assault weapons like the one used in the Sandy Hook shooting and to place limits on the amount of ammunition which could be purchased in a single transaction also failed to garner sufficient votes.
SNT.724454.4064	An onlooker in the gallery shouted "Shame on you" as the result of the vote was announced.
SNT.724454.4065	The President spoke to the press and spectators shortly after the vote was announced, passionately assuring his audience that he would continue to pursue measures to reduce the incidence of gun violence in the United States.
SNT.253090.4066	Robert Gibbs, the former press secretary for the U.S. White House, has been said to be in talks with Facebook about possible future employment as a manager for the communications aspect of the company.
SNT.253090.4067	According to an anonymous source close to the company, Gibbs is being pressed to quickly accept the job, in which Mr. Gibbs may receive millions of dollars in both salary and initial stock options for a planned public offering of Facebook Inc. in 2012.
SNT.253090.4068	Mr. Gibbs, who has worked for the Obama administration for two years, left in February 2011, and was reportedly "relaxing" and had denied rumors that he was planning to campaign for chairman of the Democratic National Committee if Tim Kaine were to leave the committee to run for a position in the senate.
SNT.253090.4069	In recent months, Facebook has stepped up lobbying the US capital to communicate its public image to policy makers, and may use Gibbs for their public relations stratagem in the future.
SNT.8709.4070	New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) announced last Wednesday that it has agreed definitively to merge with Chicago-based Archipelago Exchange (ArcaEx) and form a new publicly traded, for-profit company known as NYSE Group.
SNT.8709.4071	This announcement was followed two days later by NASDAQ®, which independently announced a definitive agreement to purchase Instinet Group.
SNT.8709.4072	Archipelago and Instinet are innovative e-trading (electronic trading) companies, and formerly were the two largest American rivals to NYSE and NASDAQ, in recent years taking increasingly large portions of their market share.
SNT.8709.4073	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies still have to review and approve the transactions, particularly with respect to US securities law and antitrust law, in order to ensure that the marketplace remains lawful and competitive.
SNT.8709.4074	Other pending issues for NASDAQ include obtaining the approval of Instinet shareholders, as well as customary closing conditions.
SNT.8709.4075	NYSE must obtain the approval of its members and Archipelago shareholders.
SNT.8709.4076	These changes, a reaction to increased e-trading competition and a changed regulatory environment, will result in NASDAQ and NYSE trading each other's shares and attempting to grab market share, which many hope will drive down transaction costs and ultimately benefit consumers.
SNT.8709.4077	However, at least one commentator, Dan Ackman writing in Forbes, has noted that the trading commission at the NYSE currently averages less than a nickel (US$0.05) per share, and was less enthusiastic about potential efficiency gains from electronic trading at the exchange.
SNT.8709.4078	The transactions are also intended to make the two leading American stock exchanges more globally competitive with such exchanges as the London Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the Australian Stock Exchange located in Sydney.
SNT.101999.4079	The 6th Stage of 2008 Tour de Taiwan held its long-distance race through 9 townships including Banciao, Hsinchuang, Wugu, Bali, Tamshui, Jinshan, Sanjhih, Shihmen, and Wanli in Taipei County today.
SNT.101999.4080	Even though this race is the second longest race in 2008 Tour de Taiwan, the weather challenged 89 cyclists due to an earlier rain in Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area.
SNT.101999.4081	Even though some cyclists were unable to finish this race due to some crashes, but several participated cyclists still successfully finished this race steadily and safely.
SNT.101999.4082	Finally, Kyle Gritters from Health Net Pro Cycling Team won the Champion of this stage.
SNT.101999.4083	Shawn Milne and Peter McDonald still threatened the current sprint and overall leader John Murphy within a difference less than 10 seconds.
SNT.629774.4084	At least one person has been killed and at least thirty were injured as the result of a fire in the city of Lagos in Nigeria after an explosion in a building with fireworks stored in it.
SNT.629774.4085	As many as nine other buildings in the Lagos Island fire yesterday were also impacted by the flames, according to authorities.
SNT.629774.4086	The fire was reportedly the cause of the explosion, although this is yet to be confirmed.
SNT.629774.4087	Some local residents reportedly jumped out of the windows of buildings in fright in the large commercial area of Jankara.
SNT.629774.4088	One man, Wasiu Olaleye, required treatment for a cut to his leg because "I had to jump from the first floor to save my life", he said.
SNT.629774.4089	Some local businesses were open when the incident occurred, but yesterday was a public holiday in Nigeria.
SNT.629774.4090	A school located in close proximity to the warehouse was significantly damaged in the incident.
SNT.629774.4091	Numerous vehicles in the area were completely burnt out by the fire.
SNT.629774.4092	The windows of several nearby buildings were also destroyed as the fire caused the windows of houses a few miles away to shake.
SNT.629774.4093	Crowds of thousands of nearby people accumulated near the fire, with spectators and individuals intending to assist or gain information about relatives amongst them.
SNT.629774.4094	Three fire service tanker vehicles attended the scene, but used up all their water supplies.
SNT.629774.4095	Some people in the crowd attempted to assist fire crews with holding fire hoses and gathering water-filled containers.
SNT.629774.4096	Some of these people were taken to hospital for treatment after experiencing injuries.
SNT.629774.4097	Additional water arrived later, as the severity of the fire slowly decreased.
SNT.629774.4098	The large crowds were part of the reason it took around an hour for fire service members to reach the scene of the fire.
SNT.629774.4099	News agency Reuters was told by a government official that the possibility of further explosions from fireworks also interfered with the fire service's rescue operation.
SNT.629774.4100	"It's very dangerous for the firemen to go in, because the government don't want any of these men to be injured", they said.
SNT.629774.4101	Ibrahim Farinloye from the National Emergency Management Agency reported one fatality to Agence France-Presse (AFP), saying: "We pulled out a body from the building".
SNT.629774.4102	Nicolas Adesile, of the Red Cross, told the same news agency that as many as thirty people have been treated thus far.

SNT.59785.4106	A United States Apache military helicopter has been shot down in Baghdad, Iraq says a military spokesman.
SNT.59785.4107	Reports say that the chopper went down near the U.S. air base, Taji, located just north of downtown Baghdad.
SNT.59785.4108	"I can confirm that we are looking into reports that a helicopter went down north of Baghdad," said Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military.
SNT.59785.4109	At least 2 soldiers were on board the aircraft, but their condition is not known.
SNT.59785.4110	Witnesses near the scene and police say that at least 2 Apaches were flying together when insurgents began to shoot at the choppers, shooting one of them down and hitting the other, but the helicopter still managed to fly away.
SNT.59785.4111	The helicopters were believed to have been escorting a U.S. military convoy on the ground when shots were fired.
SNT.59785.4112	"The chopper was swinging around before it hit the ground one kilometer away from me and I heard a big explosion," said local farmer, Hashim Assafi who also said that he had to find shelter as shots were fired in the direction of the helicopters.
SNT.59785.4113	In a statement posted on an Al-Qaeda in Iraq website, insurgents claim responsibility for shooting down the helicopter.
SNT.59785.4114	"We say to the enemies of God that the sky of the Islamic state of Iraq is forbidden just like its land," said the statement.
SNT.59785.4115	This is the fourth helicopter operated by the U.S. military to crash or be shot down in two weeks.
SNT.423635.4116	In the United States, the state of Connecticut has repealed the death penalty, becoming the seventeenth state in the U.S. to do so.
SNT.423635.4117	The state's governor Dannel Malloy signed the repeal into law on Wednesday and is to take effect immediately.
SNT.423635.4118	"This afternoon I signed legislation that will, effective today, replace the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of release as the highest form of legal punishment in Connecticut."
SNT.423635.4119	In future convictions, the death penalty will be replaced with life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.
SNT.423635.4120	However, despite the state's decision, prisoners currently serving a death row sentence are still set to be executed as planned.
SNT.423635.4121	Currently in Connecticut, eleven prisoners are serving a death row sentence, all of them men.
SNT.423635.4122	The repeal bill was passed in the state's house of representatives with 86 supporting the measure and 63 opposing it.
SNT.423635.4123	The senate had passed the measure just seven days before.
SNT.423635.4124	Jodi Rell, then Connecticut's governor, blocked a prior attempt at repeal by state lawmakers in 2009.
SNT.423635.4125	Only one person in Connecticut has been executed since 1976, when the U.S. government reinstated the death penalty after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld capital punishment.
SNT.423635.4126	That execution of serial killer Michael Bruce Ross occurred in 2005 by lethal injection.
SNT.423635.4127	"As our state moves beyond this divisive debate, I hope we can all redouble our efforts and common work to improve the fairness and integrity of our criminal justice system, and to minimize its fallibility," added Malloy.
SNT.143205.4128	A suicide bomber has killed at least 24 people near the Pakistani army headquarters in Rawalpindi when he detonated explosives while riding on a motorbike outside a bank, several hundred metres away from army headquarters.
SNT.143205.4129	Gunmen had kept up a 24-hour hostage-taking assault last month at those same headquarters.
SNT.143205.4130	Many people, such as retired and serving military officials, civilians, had come to the bank to collect their salaries, were killed or wounded by the blast.
SNT.143205.4131	Many hospitals declared emergency services and rushed to help the people out.
SNT.143205.4132	Soon after the bomb blast, military personnel patrolled the road and diverted all the traffic in front of the bank and Shalimar hotel beside it.
SNT.143205.4133	Most of the people who died or wounded in the blast were mainly military officials.
SNT.143205.4134	The bomb blast destroyed many window panes in the building and in neighbouring buildings.
SNT.143205.4135	Raja Sajid, who was an eyewitness to the incident, helped people into the ambulances.
SNT.143205.4136	Television stations showed ambulances and police vehicles racing to the scene.
SNT.143205.4137	"I helped the rescuers and put several of them in the ambulances."
SNT.143205.4138	"An old man stained in blood was crying for help," he said.
SNT.143205.4139	The blast comes as the United Nations announced it was withdrawing its international staff from northwestern Pakistan due to security concerns.
SNT.143205.4140	Militants carried out several retaliatory attacks last month that killed hundreds of people.
SNT.211335.4141	Nineteen people were killed and three are unaccounted for after an overloaded ferry boat sank in a river in a flooded region of Burma.
SNT.211335.4142	Many young children, travelling to an inter-village football tournament in Michaungai, were killed when the boat sank.
SNT.211335.4143	During the rescue efforts, bodies of children aged between five and fifteen were recovered from the water, along with the bodies of two teachers and two local villagers.
SNT.211335.4144	Authorities are continuing to search for three people who are still missing after the disaster.
SNT.211335.4145	There were 79 people aboard the boat when it sank in the Irrawaddy river, according to an unnamed official.
SNT.211335.4146	A rescue worker suggested that there had been heavy rain around 10 a.m., when the ferry struck a strong wave and sank.
SNT.211335.4147	"The boat flipped at a confluence of creeks—these are small, narrow creeks connecting villages," he said.
SNT.211335.4148	Locals suggested that the boat, which was reportedly overloaded, flipped and lost balance, trapping young children underneath.
SNT.211335.4149	The accident took place as strong winds and heavy rain battered the area, causing large waves and strong currents in waterways.
SNT.211335.4150	Reports indicate that many residents of the vast region rely heavily on poorly-maintained river ferries for cheap transportation, since many areas are inaccessible by road.
SNT.211335.4151	138,000 people were killed and thousands more were left homeless when when Cyclone Nargis devastated the region in May 2008.

SNT.30531.4155	Mehmet Ali Agca, jailed in 1981 for shooting and injuring former Pope John Paul II in Rome has been released from Turkish prison.
SNT.30531.4156	A Turkish court had determined that he had already completed his sentence with time served.
SNT.30531.4157	Agca shot the Pope as he rode around St Peter's Square in a open-topped car.
SNT.30531.4158	Agca was a Turkish militant who was a member of the nationalist Grey Wolves; however, his motives for the shooting remain unclear.
SNT.30531.4159	Agca was sentenced to life in prison in Italy, before being pardoned by former Pope John Paul II in 2000 and extradited to Turkey to serve jail time for the murder of Abdi Ipekci, a journalist.
SNT.30531.4160	Turkish citizens were outraged that he served only four and a half years for murder.
SNT.12045.4161	The former CEO of Tyco International, Dennis Kozlowski, as well as CFO Mark Swartz are convicted of taking more than $600 million from the company.
SNT.12045.4162	Charges include grand larceny, securities fraud, conspiracy, and falsifying business records.
SNT.12045.4163	The first trial ended in a mistrial after one juror received a threatening letter.
SNT.12045.4164	Nancy Salomon says of the second trial that the "Defense was counting on the jury not reaching a verdict; they had used their challenges during the jury selection process to kick almost every potential juror who had a college degree, or had any business experience or Wall Street experience off the jury ... they were hoping that this case was just going to be too confusing for the jury."
SNT.12045.4165	To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution "basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an MBA", teaching them about following paper trails and detecting falsification of business records.
SNT.12045.4166	It paid off during deliberation as the jury requested over 100 documents to review.
SNT.12045.4167	The two former executives face a minimum of eight years in prison, up to a maximum of 25 years.
SNT.12045.4168	In addition, Kozlowski is accused of evading $1 million in sales taxes on six paintings that he bought in 2001 in a separate New York State case, and Swartz faces tax evasion charges in New Hampshire.
SNT.12045.4169	If convicted in these cases as well, they would face up to 30 years in prison.
SNT.9055.4170	Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government received a vote of confidence from the Italian Senate Thursday, after it earned the confidence of the House yesterday.
SNT.9055.4171	The Senate's tally was 170 pros, 117 cons and no abstentions.
SNT.9055.4172	Berlusconi declared these votes of confidence as demonstrating the strength and coherence of his coalition.
SNT.9055.4173	He also declared that he wanted a change in the electoral law so that a bipartisan political system would arise, and that he wants to form a majority government after the next election.
SNT.190678.4174	What is believed to be the world's oldest leather shoe, over 5,500 year old, has been found in a cave in Armenia by a team of archaeologists.
SNT.190678.4175	The Armenian shoe is in a perfectly preserved condition and is a few hundred years older than the one found on Ötzi the Iceman, making it the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world, and the oldest footwear yet found in Europe.
SNT.190678.4176	The leather shoe was found in a cave dubbed Areni-1, near the village of Areni in the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia, on the Iranian and Turkish borders.
SNT.190678.4177	"I was amazed to find that even the shoe-laces were preserved," recalled Diana Zardaryan, the Armenian PhD student who made the discovery.
SNT.190678.4178	According to researchers, the shoe, made of cow-hide, consists of only one leather piece and was probably customised to the wearer's foot.
SNT.190678.4179	It was relatively small, measuring the corresponding to European size 37 or US size 7 women, however, it could have been worn by a man.
SNT.190678.4180	It was kept in excellent condition by a thick layer of sheep excrement, which acted as a seal, helping it survive the millennia.
SNT.190678.4181	The shoe contained grass, although the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was to used to maintain the shape of the shoe and/or prepare it for storage.
SNT.190678.4182	"We thought initially that the shoe and other objects were about 600-700 years old because they were in such good condition," said co-author Dr. Ron Pinhasi from the University College Cork in Ireland.
SNT.190678.4183	The shoe and the cave will continue to be researched.
SNT.190678.4184	"We do not know yet what the shoe or other objects were doing in the cave or what the purpose of the cave was," said Pinhasi, "We know that there are children's graves at the back of the cave but so little is known about this period that we cannot say with any certainty why all these different objects were found together".
SNT.190678.4185	Currently, the oldest known footwear are sandals made from sagebrush bark, found in Fort Rock Cave, Oregon in the United States.
SNT.190678.4186	These shoes were discovered in 1938, and have been dated to about 10,000 years before present.
SNT.190678.4187	Discoveries within the cave move early bronze-age cultural activity in Armenia back by about 800 years.
SNT.190678.4188	Additional discoveries yielded an extensive array of Copper Age artifacts dating to between 6,200 and 5,900 years ago.
SNT.236246.4189	In a Tuesday media event, Verizon Wireless announced it had reached an agreement with Apple Inc. and would begin selling a CDMA version of the iPhone 4 beginning early February.
SNT.236246.4190	The move means the end of rival company AT&T's status as the only official US carrier of the iPhone, a status it held since the first iPhone debuted in 2007.
SNT.236246.4191	The press conference, held in New York City, was hosted by Verizon's president, Lowell McAdam, Apple's chief operating officer, Tim Cook, and Verizon Wireless' chief executive officer, Dan Mead.
SNT.236246.4192	Neither Verizon Communications CEO Ivan Seidenberg nor Apple CEO Steve Jobs attended the conference.
SNT.236246.4193	During the event, McAdam said, "If the press writes something long enough and hard enough, it eventually comes true."
SNT.236246.4194	"We're bringing the fruit of our labor with a giant partner, and that's Apple."
SNT.236246.4195	Such a partnership had been rumored for years, and the amount of speculation grew over the past few months.
SNT.236246.4196	iPhone 4 pre-orders for current Verizon users begin February 3, and a public release is scheduled for February 10.
SNT.236246.4197	The "Verizon iPhone," as it has been dubbed for months, has been altered from the original iPhone 4 so it can utilize Verizon's 3G CDMA (code division multiple access) network.
SNT.236246.4198	This means, however, that Verizon iPhone users will not be able to use the company's 4G LTE (long term evolution) network, and will thus be unable to make calls and access the Internet at the same time.
SNT.236246.4199	Cook told the audience that the LTE hardware was not ready yet, saying, "The first generation LTE chip sets force some design compromises, some of which we would not make."
SNT.236246.4200	"Secondly—and most importantly—Verizon Wireless customers have told us they want the iPhone now."
SNT.236246.4201	However, Verizon's iPhone 4 allows the user to create a personal Wi-Fi hotspot, which means up to five other wireless devices can connect to the Internet through the phone.
SNT.236246.4202	Pricing was announced as US$199 for a 16 GB version and US$299 for a 32 GB version, both requiring two-year contracts—the same cost for an AT&T iPhone 4.
SNT.236246.4203	However, Verizon said it would not mention the cost of data plans at this time, with Mead saying, "We talked about the device pricing, but we're not going to talk about the pricing for the network for that connectivity."
SNT.12156.4204	Four members of a filmcrew have been arrested on suspicion of assault after squirting water at movie star Tom Cruise at the London premiere of the War of the Worlds on Sunday evening.
SNT.12156.4205	The crew were freelancers filming a new comedy show for Channel 4.
SNT.12156.4206	Channel 4 has no production facilities itself; all television programmes are commissioned from independent companies .
SNT.12156.4207	Cruise had been on a walkabout meeting and greeting fans, and was being interviewed by the crew under the impression that it was a serious interview, when they used a fake microphone to squirt him in the face.
SNT.12156.4208	He took hold of the culprit, grasping his wrist, asking him why he did it.
SNT.12156.4209	"Why would you do that? What's so funny about that? It's ridiculous."
SNT.12156.4210	"I'm here giving you an interview, answering your questions and you do something nasty."
SNT.12156.4211	Security guards then took the filmcrew away, before they were arrested and bailed by the police.
SNT.12156.4212	Scotland Yard have said, "We will see whether to pursue the charges, or see whether the victim wants to pursue it."
SNT.12156.4213	Tom Cruise resumed meeting fans and signing autographs, spending an hour in Leicester Square.
SNT.40624.4214	The Bulls rugby team has managed to reach the semi-finals of the Southern Hemisphere provincial rugby union competition, the Super 14.
SNT.40624.4215	Despite entering the match with the burden of having to score 32 points and receiving a bonus point (by scoring four tries), the Bulls managed to overcome fellow South African team, the Stormers, at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town on Saturday May 13, winning the match 43 points to 10 in the final round of the regular season.
SNT.40624.4217	Entering the final round of the regular season, the Bulls and fellow South African Durban-based Sharks, as well as the Australian Canberra-based Brumbies were the only sides in contention for the fourth and last finals position.
SNT.40624.4218	After the Brumbies, who unlike the Sharks were actually ahead on the number of points, were soundly defeated by the Canterbury-based Crusaders, 33 points to 3, the result meant that either the Sharks or Bulls could mathematically take fourth position on the ladder.
SNT.40624.4219	The Sharks stormed to victory over Perth-based Western Force, winning 41 points to 25, meaning that the Bulls would have to score at least four tries to be ensured of a bonus point, to move ahead of the Sharks, who were now sitting in front of them on points difference.
SNT.40624.4220	Despite the set back of both prop Danie Thiart and captain Victor Matfield to the sin-bin in the first half, the Pretoria-based Bulls entered halftime leading 26 points to 3.
SNT.40624.4221	A try to the Stormers happened in the opening minute of the second half, though the Bulls held on to the victory.
SNT.40624.4222	Bryan Habana scored the last try, which was subsequently converted and pushed the Bulls into fourth place on the table on points difference.
SNT.40624.4223	The Bulls will now faced the Crusaders in New Zealand next week for a spot in the final, the other spot is to be contested also in New Zealand, between the Wellington-based Hurricanes and the New South Wales Waratahs.
SNT.57053.4224	On December 22, 2006 Microsoft has announced that it has extended its warranty for all Xbox 360 video game consoles to one year in the United States.
SNT.57053.4225	While this one year warranty applies to all Xbox 360 software as well, Xbox 360 accessories will still carry their original 90 day warranty.
SNT.57053.4226	"Customers that experience hardware issues with their Xbox 360 within one year of purchase will have their consoles repaired at no cost."
SNT.57053.4227	"Moreover, the new warranty policy is retroactive, so consumers that may have already paid for out-of-warranty Xbox 360 repair within one year of the console's purchase will be eligible for reimbursement of their console repair charges."
SNT.57053.4228	This extension should help ease customers' minds who have been concerned with the Xbox 360's reputation for hardware failures.
SNT.57053.4229	A partial list of hardware issues can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems
SNT.57053.4230	People who have paid for Xbox 360 repair will be automatically distributed a reimbursement check in about 10 weeks from the present date.
SNT.57053.4231	Previously in September, 2006, Microsoft had waived the cost for repairs on all Xbox 360 consoles made before January 1, 2006, and refunded any fees already paid.
SNT.131234.4232	A leak at an offshore oil drilling rig has caused an oil slick off Australia's coast.
SNT.131234.4233	According to the rig's operator, it could take weeks to fully plug it.
SNT.131234.4234	Gas and oil started leaking from a hole beneath the sea floor on early Friday.
SNT.131234.4235	It has caused an oil slick about nine miles long and thirty yards wide．
SNT.131234.4236	Officials, however, said that there was no threat to the environment and it was improbable the slick would reach the Australian coast.
SNT.131234.4237	Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said that "there's no threat to the Australian coast."
SNT.131234.4238	"It is evaporating naturally and the work of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will merely assist in that evaporation."
SNT.131234.4239	69 people were evacuated from the rig on Friday, amid fears that a fire could start from the condensate oil.
SNT.131234.4240	The rig is located approximately 150 miles off the coast of Kimberley.
SNT.80634.4241	Martin Hyde is running for the Green Party of Ontario in the Ontario provincial election, in the Ottawa West-Nepean riding.
SNT.80634.4242	Wikinews' Nick Moreau interviewed him regarding his values, his experience, and his campaign.
SNT.80634.4243	Note that he did not answer the question "Of the decisions made by Ontario's 38th Legislative Assembly, which was the most beneficial to your electoral district?"
SNT.80634.4243-2	"To the province as a whole?"
SNT.80634.4243-3	"Which was least beneficial, or even harmful, to this riding?"
SNT.80634.4243-4	"To the province as a whole?"
SNT.80634.4244	Stay tuned for further interviews; every candidate from every party is eligible, and will be contacted.
SNT.80634.4245	Expect interviews from Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, New Democratic Party members, Ontario Greens, as well as members from the Family Coalition, Freedom, Communist, Libertarian, and Confederation of Regions parties, as well as independents.
SNT.109708.4246	On January 8, 2008 in Stephenville, Texas, one of the larger UFO sightings in the United States occurred.
SNT.109708.4247	A few days ago the UFO investigative organization Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) released a 77-page report on the sighting.
SNT.109708.4248	MUFON is a UFO investigative organization in the United States.
SNT.109708.4249	Founded in 1969, it now has 3,000 members and is headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado.
SNT.109708.4250	The MUFON report, entitled "Special Research Report Stephenville, Texas" was written by Glen Schulze and Ropert Powell.
SNT.109708.4251	Shulze has radar experience from working at the White Sands Missile Range.
SNT.109708.4252	Powell has a chemistry degree and has extensive experience with semiconductors from working for Advanced Micro Devices.
SNT.109708.4253	The report is an analysis of radar records from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Weather Service, obtained through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and comparing them to witness accounts.
SNT.109708.4254	Shulze/Powell concluded that the radar data confirms the witness observations of an object, as well as the Air Force's statement that said ten aircraft were operating in the area.
SNT.109708.4255	They say that it is too difficult to say what the witnesses saw, but that there was something there.
SNT.109708.4256	Twice, they say, radar picked up an object travelling at nearly 2,000 mph, and at other times it showed a slow moving object.
SNT.109708.4257	Much media attention has been focused on the report's observation that radar records show one of two objects moving directly toward the Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford.
SNT.109708.4258	This is the home of United States President George W. Bush, which has been nicknamed the Western White House.
SNT.109708.4259	They did not draw any conclusion as to why such movement was observed.
SNT.109708.4260	The authors also concluded that military air activity was heavy at the time, but that the radar records show no overt action toward the unknown object.
SNT.109708.4261	They express concern about the possibilty that this could have been a terrorist aircraft with no transponder.
SNT.109708.4262	Shulze/Powell stated that they felt that they had been stonewalled in some of their FOIA requests by some government agencies.
SNT.109708.4263	They encouraged the government to more readily provide more information about the incident.
SNT.109708.4264	The Stephenville incident on January 8, saw dozens of witnesses reporting a large object in the evening sky that hovered above the community before it took off at high speed.
SNT.109708.4265	Steve Allen, a pilot, observed the object from the ground and described it as being a half-mile with flashing strobe lights.
SNT.109708.4266	He also said that it was pursued by two fighter jets, when it disappeared at a speed he estimated to be 3,000 mph.
SNT.109708.4267	"I don't know if it was a biblical experience or somebody from a different universe or whatever but it was definitely not from around these parts," Allen said.
SNT.109708.4268	Another witness was local law enforcement officer Leroy Gateman who reported it as a red glowing object suspended 3,000 feet in the air.
SNT.109708.4269	"It was so fast I couldn't track it with my binoculars," said Gateman.
SNT.109708.4270	Rick Sorrells says he saw the object while deer hunting in the woods.
SNT.109708.4271	"You look at the trees, and it was right here," he told ABC News.
SNT.109708.4272	He estimated it to be the length of "three or four football fields," though he could not be entirely sure due to his vantage point.
SNT.109708.4273	Sorrells has later claimed that military helicopters have since overflown his property at low altitude and that he has been getting strange phone calls.
SNT.109708.4274	He also claims that an unknown man came to his door, even once told him that,"Son we have the same caliber weapons you have, but we have more of them", after Sorrells grabbed his rifle, and, "You need to shut your mouth about what you saw."
SNT.109708.4275	"I'm trying to decide whether or not to open the door," Sorrells said to the Empire-Tribune.
SNT.109708.4276	"We're just standing there face to face looking at each other."
SNT.109708.4277	"I'm thinking he's dressed for the elements and the dogs are raising such a ruckus he must know he's in danger of being caught."
SNT.109708.4278	"That's when I realized he wanted me to see him."
SNT.109708.4279	The man then turned away and walked into the woods.
SNT.109708.4280	The United States Air Force initially said witnesses must have seen reflections coming from commercial airliners.
SNT.109708.4281	However, they later clarified that ten F-16 Fighting Falcons had been on a night-time training mission in the area on January 8.
SNT.109708.4282	"In the interest of public awareness, Air Force Reserve Command Public Affairs realized an error was made regarding the reported training activity of military aircraft," said the statement.
SNT.109708.4283	According to Air Force spokesperson Karl Lewis, the aircraft were from the 457th Fighter Squadron and the error in the initial report was due to an internal communications problem between offices at the base.
SNT.256881.4284	Following on from January's strike, the UK's Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) yesterday took 24 hours strike action in a dispute over working conditions within call centres providing Jobcentre services for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).
SNT.256881.4285	A press release sent Sunday night by Katrine Williams, the Chair of PCS Wales, states 70% of members who voted were in favour of the industrial action.
SNT.256881.4286	PCS members "suffer oppressive working conditions that simply result in high levels of stress and sickness" according to the union, and points to the 2,779 staff who left Jobcentre Plus call centres since April last year – approximately 20% of the workforce in the 37 Jobcentre Plus offices handling calls from the public – as evidence of the challenging work environment.
SNT.256881.4287	The union says management is "obsessed with hitting call centre targets at the expense of providing good quality services to the public".
SNT.256881.4288	The DWP characterises the action differently, stating 75% of staff voted against the strike.
SNT.256881.4289	According to the DWP staff work under reasonable terms, but "we have to ensure that our service is available when our customers, who include some of the most vulnerable people in the country, need us."
SNT.256881.4290	To that end the DWP readily admits it uses performance measures to ensure high productivity and performance, their goal is to "deliver value for money for the taxpayer", and they do not have any plans to change the way they do business.
SNT.256881.4291	A report in the Liverpool Daily Post cites more than 500 Merseyside staff on strike, and quotes PCS regional secretary Peter Middleman describing the culture in-place in Jobcentre Plus contact centres as "battery-farmed working practices".
SNT.256881.4292	Similarly, the Lancashire Telegraph cites 120 staff on strike at the Cardwell Place call centre and the expectation that 2,500 across the North West of England were expected to take action; Middleman is quoted describing the call centres as "the modern day equivalents of dark, satanic mills where our members are over worked, overly monitored and forced to endure an obsession with arbitrary targets".
SNT.256881.4293	The DWP reported the union informed them approximately 40% of the 9,000 staff in JSP contact centres would be taking action, which tallied with their own estimates.
SNT.256881.4294	Face-to-face Jobcentre services were unaffected by yesterday's strike action; the union have announced that this will be followed with an indefinite ban on members working overtime.
SNT.77328.4295	The remains of the last missing person following the bridge collapse in Minneapolis were recovered on Monday.
SNT.77328.4296	The official death toll now stands at 13, following the collapse nearly three weeks ago.
SNT.77328.4297	Jolstad, nicknamed "Jolly," was a member of the construction crew that was resurfacing the bridge.
SNT.77328.4298	Jolstad's wife, Lisa Jolstad, was worried that the search for her husband's remains would drag on, leaving her without any closure.
SNT.77328.4299	Sheriff Rich Stanek said, "There aren't a lot of smiles here tonight…"
SNT.77328.4300	"We all have very heavy hearts."
SNT.77328.4300-1	"It weighed on a lot of people, both personally and professionally."
SNT.77328.4301	Governor Tim Pawlenty asked President Bush on Monday to declare the collapse a major disaster, allowing the state to be eligible for more federal money.
SNT.77328.4302	President Bush is scheduled to be in Minneapolis today to get a briefing on the bridge.
SNT.13019.4303	They said that they defend the investigation of corruption schemes, however they said that the Lula government is the victim of a destabilization campaign.
SNT.13019.4304	They blame the President of the United States George W. Bush for the crisis.
SNT.13019.4305	They say that the government of Lula is victim of a coup attempt by Bush supporters.
SNT.13019.4306	Other parliamentarians, even some of the Workers' Party, didn't agree with the coup argument.
SNT.13019.4307	Some senators said that only the Wokers' Party itself initiated the crisis.
SNT.143612.4308	The NATO-led force in Afghanistan issued a statement on Friday saying that that two of its troops went missing on Wednesday while on a routine supply mission.
SNT.143612.4309	The statement said a search operation is under way, but did not give many details.
SNT.143612.4310	A NATO press officer said that "We continue exhaustive search and rescue operations to locate our missing service members."
SNT.143612.4311	Local police said that the soldiers were likely swept away by a river in Badghis, a western province, while they were trying to get to an airdropped food parcel that had fallen into the river.
SNT.143612.4312	Officials said it was not likely that they were taken captive.
SNT.143612.4313	"The families of these service members have been notified about their loved ones' status and we will continue to keep them informed as information becomes available," a press officer said.
SNT.25404.4314	The Dover, Pennsylvania school board became the first to mandate inclusion of Intelligent Design in a public school biology curriculum.
SNT.25404.4315	For this year's November 8 election, Republicans fielded a pro-Intelligent Design slate of candidates including some returning candidates who had previously voted to include a statement about Intelligent Design in the biology curriculum.
SNT.25404.4316	A mixed slate of Democrat and Republican candidates came forward as an alternative group of school board candidates, the Dover CARES coalition.
SNT.25404.4317	They proposed to remove Intelligent Design from the biology curriculum but allow discussion of Intelligent Design in courses dealing with philosophy and comparative religion.
SNT.25404.4318	All eight open school board seats were won by Dover CARES coalition candidates.
SNT.25404.4319	Two candidates who had previously voted as school board members to include intelligent design in the public school science curriculum received the fewest votes in Tuesday's election.
SNT.25404.4320	One of the newly elected board members is Bryan Rehm, a parent of a Dover school student.
SNT.25404.4321	Rehm, along with ten other parents, initiated a law suit against the school board for its decision to insert Intelligent Design into the science curriculum.
SNT.25404.4322	In October 2004, the Dover school board decided that Intelligent Design is a scientific theory that should be mentioned in biology classes that include discussion of biological evolution as part of the course content.
SNT.25404.4323	The board mandated that a statement should be read in those classes stating "Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life," and "The school leaves the discussion of the Origins of Life to individual students and their families."
SNT.25404.4324	The school board's statement on Intelligent Design directs students to the book Of Pandas and People as a source of information "for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what Intelligent Design actually involves."
SNT.25404.4325	This book is published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, a non-profit organization founded for the purpose of "promoting and publishing textbooks presenting a Christian perspective."
SNT.25404.4326	Parents of some Dover public school students filed a lawsuit against the school board, charging that including the school board's statement on Intelligent Design was an attempt to introduce religion into the science curriculum.
SNT.25404.4327	The book Of Pandas and People says, "Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency."
SNT.25404.4328	The original complaint in the law suit against the school board claimed that "Intelligent design is a non-scientific argument or assertion."
SNT.25404.4329	The US District Court Judge John Jones, who heard the non-jury case, hopes to make his ruling by the end of the year.
SNT.25404.4330	The evidence phase of the trial ended on November 4, 2005.
SNT.25404.4331	A local Dover newspaper, the York Daily Record, editorialized that Dover voters should take trial testimony into account during the general election when they could cast votes for school board members along with other elective offices.
SNT.25404.4332	Biology teachers in the Dover schools have refused to read the school board's statement on Intelligent Design to students because the Pennsylvania state code for education states that "The professional educator may not knowingly and intentionally misrepresent subject matter."
SNT.25404.4333	In a letter to their administrator, the teachers stated their view that "Intelligent design is not science."
SNT.25404.4334	School administrators have been reading the school board's Intelligent Design statement to students in Dover public schools.
SNT.79948.4335	In a free trade zone in Antalya, Turkey, 80 women workers of FMC Novamed are in strike for almost a year now, since September 26th, 2006.
SNT.79948.4336	They allege not only low wages but also severe abuses on FMC's part.
SNT.79948.4337	Novamed, founded in 2001, is a factory managed by Turkish capitalists and located in the free trade zone in Antalya, Turkey.
SNT.79948.4338	It is owned by Fresenius Medical Care (FMC), which is an international corporation with its headquarters in Germany.
SNT.79948.4339	With factories in 12 countries and a total of 100,000 workers, FMC is a monopoly in the market of dialysis products.
SNT.10408.4340	NASA has completed a major test of a 20-meter square solar sail, marking a "crucial milestone" in space propulsion technology.
SNT.10408.4341	It is not the first to test solar sails, as the Japanese have deployed two solar sails in space.
SNT.10408.4342	The Planetary Society is planning on launching a solar sail possibly by June 21.
SNT.10408.4343	Shot into orbit by a converted intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Cosmos 1 would be launched from a submerged Russian submarine from within the Barents Sea.
SNT.10408.4344	The spacecraft, powered by the sail, will have no destination.
SNT.10408.4345	The purpose is simply to test the propulsion system that uses the pressure from solar light particles to move the ship outward from a starting orbit around the earth at 500 miles.
SNT.10408.4346	The propulsion technology is currently believed to be the most efficient available for interstellar space travel.
SNT.10408.4347	Theoretically a craft propelled by the pressure of a constant light source, such as a purpose-built laser, could achieve speeds approaching the speed of light.
SNT.10408.4348	This is due to the efficiencies of the spacecraft not having to carry its own fuel.
SNT.10408.4349	Approaching the speed of light would, however, require a long period of constant acceleration.
SNT.10408.4350	Such high speed will be impossible for the current test vehicles and any launched in the foreseeable future, as they rely on the light from the Sun, which rapidly becomes weaker with increasing distance.
SNT.10408.4351	According to the National Geographic News, "NASA, the European Space Agency, Japan, and Russia all have developed solar sails, but none has yet tried to prove that the sails can propel a spacecraft under controlled flight."
SNT.107402.4352	The Supreme Court of Japan ruled on Wednesday that a condition imposed by an Act for acquiring Japanese nationality is unconstitutional, and confirmed the nationality of the plaintiffs.
SNT.107402.4353	Each of the ten plaintiffs is a child who was born to a Filipino mother and later acknowledged by a Japanese father.
SNT.107402.4354	They filed claims for Japanese nationality between 2003 and 2005, but the government turned down because the parents were not legally married in each case.
SNT.107402.4355	According to Japan's Act on nationality, a non-Japanese child (under 20) who was after its birth legitimated by marriage and acknowledgment can acquire Japanese nationality by filing notification, with some requirements which the plaintiffs had already fulfilled.
SNT.107402.4356	The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the condition 'legitimated by marriage' results in unreasonable distinctions to violate Article 14 of the Constitution of Japan, which guarantees equality under the law.
SNT.107402.4357	The Supreme Court left effective the rest of this provision and accepted the plaintiffs' claims for Japanese nationality.
SNT.107402.4358	The judgment pointed out recent changes in people's notions in Japan as to family life or parent-child relationship, and also referred to two conventions which Japan has ratified.
SNT.107402.4359	There are estimated to be tens of thousands of children in similar situations in Japan and a considerable number overseas.
SNT.107402.4360	Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura on Wednesday made a comment about the judgment at a press conference.
SNT.107402.4361	Machimura said, "This judgment, saying violation of Constitution, weighs so much."
SNT.107402.4362	"As a government, we should take it gravely, and we want to examine its content in detail and consider how to react."
SNT.107402.4363	He added, "I have an impression, just hearing of it, that it's a reasonable judgment."
SNT.107402.4364	"Equality under the law is an important point of view."
SNT.107402.4365	:(a) while it's within the scope of the Legislation of the Diet how conditions are set for acquiring / losing Japanese nationality (Article 10), a distinction without rational reasons brought by such a condition may be unconstitutional (Article 14: Paragraph 1).
SNT.107402.4366	:(b) being legitimated by the parents' marriage or not is a thing the child can not change by its will or endeavor.
SNT.107402.4367	:(c) the purpose of legislation of this provision is rational, because that is considered to demand the child's tight connection with Japan's society.
SNT.107402.4368	:(d) after this provision was added in 1984, both notions and actual situations of people in Japan have been becoming of variety, as to family life or parent-child relationship.
SNT.107402.4369	:(e) the child's tight connection with Japan's society can not be measured instantly by whether the parents have got legally married.
SNT.107402.4370	:(g) this provision results in distinctions not only as to legitimacy but also as to two other factors: any non-Japanese child without legitimacy acknowledged before its birth by a Japanese father, and any child without legitimacy born to a Japanese mother, can acquire Japanese nationality provided by this Act.
SNT.107402.4371	These distinctions have no rational relation with the purpose of legislation.
SNT.107402.4372	:(h) another provision in this Act states a child in this situation may be naturalized with fewer conditions, but it doesn't justify the relation between the purpose and the distinctions, because naturalization is within discretion of the Minister of Justice.
SNT.107402.4373	One judge in the majority, who supported the conclusion, shared a view with the five dissenting: the distinction as to legitimacy is caused by non-existence of due legislation.
SNT.107402.4374	This judge concluded that the Judiciary can remedy the lack, because it doesn't betray the will of the Legislation of the Diet as to this Act.
SNT.107402.4375	Two dissenting judges of the five concluded that these distinctions are unconstitutional, but correction of it depends, in principle, on legislative measures by the Diet.
SNT.107402.4376	The other opinion of three dissenting judges is contrary to the major opinion.
SNT.107402.4377	They argued, for example, :the distinction as to legitimacy is not unconstitutional and is within the range of choice of legislative measures.
SNT.107402.4378	:even if it's unconstitutional, the plaintiffs' appeals are to be dismissed, following the viewpoint in the other dissenting opinion.
SNT.107402.4379	:it's dubious whether or how people in Japan have been making changes as in (d).
SNT.107402.4380	:it's rational to offer Japanese nationality in two other situations as in (g).
SNT.107402.4381	:easy naturalization as in (h) to offer Japanese nationality is rational both as a measure and in practice.
SNT.107402.4382	:foreign countries' movement as in (f) is not to be instantly reflected in judgment on constitutionality; they are different from Japan, with a large number of international marriages and expansion of regional unification like EU.
SNT.272325.4383	United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Saturday that the recent actions by Turkey to arrest and detain journalists in the country, as well as planned Internet restrictions, are "an area of concern" for her.
SNT.272325.4384	Clinton is on a two-day visit to Turkey and made some of her comments during a news conference on the Turkish CNN channel during an event where she answered questions from Turkish citizens.
SNT.272325.4385	Answering a question regarding the issue, she said that "I do not think it’s necessary or in Turkey's interests to be cracking down on journalists and bloggers and the Internet [...] it seems to me inconsistent with all the other advances that Turkey has made."
SNT.272325.4386	In a press conference jointly held with Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, Clinton suggested that Turkey could serve as an example for Arab countries currently undergoing governmental changes.
SNT.272325.4387	She said that "people in the Middle East and North Africa are seeking to draw lessons from Turkey's experience" and that "democratic development also depends on responsible leadership."
SNT.272325.4388	According to Turkish media groups, upwards of 60 journalists are being held based on dubious evidence, though government officials say that only 26 are imprisoned, all on charges separate from their activities in the media.
SNT.272325.4389	In some recent arrests, authorities have cited anti-terror laws as justification.
SNT.272325.4390	Separately, the government plans next month to place filters on Internet traffic in the country, which could allow for monitoring of individual users.
SNT.272325.4391	Such human rights concerns have long served as a stumbling block for Turkey's attempts to join the European Union.
SNT.108082.4392	Interstate 80 is closed in Cedar County, Iowa, east of the Iowa City area, due to flooding from the Iowa River and Coralville Lake.
SNT.108082.4393	The flooding that has devastated cities in eastern Iowa has travelled downstream and is now threatening Iowa City and Coralville, both of which have issued evacuations for low-lying areas.
SNT.108082.4394	Flooding on the Cedar River earlier filled Waterloo, Cedar Falls, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with record-breaking water levels.
SNT.108082.4395	Interstate 80 is closed between mile markers 266 and 267, with a 281-mile long detour to get around it: Eastbound through traffic must leave I-80 at Des Moines and travel north along Interstate 35 then east to Dubuque via U.S. Route 20, where it can move south along U.S. Route 61 to return to Interstate 80 at the Quad Cities, with westbound through traffic following the opposite route.
SNT.108082.4396	Local traffic is being allowed, since this shuts off a 150-mile stretch of highway.
SNT.108082.4397	Interstate 380 has also been closed, between mile markers 4 and 10, due to flooding from the Iowa River and Lake Coralville.
SNT.108082.4398	This, combined with the flooding of the bridges across the Cedar River at Cedar Rapids, effectively cuts Cedar Rapids off from Iowa City; the only way between the two cities, normally 30 miles apart, is a 281-mile long detour that takes drivers through Des Moines.
SNT.108082.4399	The Cedar River at Cedar Rapids crested today at a record-breaking 31.1 feet, nearly 20 feet above flood stage.
SNT.108082.4400	The Iowa River is expected to crest at Iowa City at 33 feet, 11 feet over flood stage and 4.5 feet over the record, on the morning of June 17.
SNT.207432.4401	Leonard Skinner, the namesake of rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, has died at the age of 77.
SNT.207432.4402	Skinner was a gym teacher and basketball coach and taught members of the group.
SNT.207432.4403	His death was announced by his son, also named Leonard Skinner, who also said that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
SNT.207432.4404	Skinner died at the St. Catherine Laboure Manor nursing home in Riverside at 02.30 a.m.
SNT.207432.4405	His son said that he had a bowl of ice cream shortly after midnight.
SNT.207432.4406	He had been at the home for about a year.
SNT.207432.4407	The coach taught the members of the group in the 1960s and was reportedly hard on the students.
SNT.207432.4408	He later said in a 2009 interview that "he was just following the rules".
SNT.207432.4409	He disputed the rumours that he was extra tough on them or that he kicked them out of school.
SNT.207432.4410	In later years he opened up his own bar and became friends with some members of the group and even introduced them at one of their concerts in Jacksonville.
SNT.120451.4411	Two train derailments in two days have closed railway lines in Australia.
SNT.120451.4412	A Rio Tinto iron ore train derailled at Pilbara, on a spur of the Tom Price to Dampier line on Thursday 29.
SNT.120451.4413	The following day, a freight train with 40 wagons derailed east of Kalgoorlie, injuring three people.
SNT.120451.4414	The second derailment has closed the line used by the long distance Sydney to Perth Indian Pacific passenger train.
SNT.120451.4415	Operators Great Southern Railway expect to lose A$500,000 revenues as the line remains closed until at least Thursday.
SNT.120451.4416	Police say heavy rain has affected the area, and the federal Australian Rail Track Corporation say that a new access road needs to be built in order to clear the wreckage and repair the track.
SNT.120451.4417	Rio Tinto have sufficient stocks of iron ore already in place to keep working.
SNT.120451.4418	However, the freight train was carrying consumer products, which may run short in the south of Western Australia in the next few days.
SNT.120451.4419	The Kalgoorie crash is to be investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, while maintenance company Transfield Services will also be examining the incident.
SNT.61058.4420	Researchers with the University of Calgary in Canada have found that prolactin, a hormone produced during pregnancy, may reverse the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), according to a paper published this week in The Journal of Neuroscience.
SNT.61058.4421	The study, led by Drs. Samuel Weiss and V. Wee Yong of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, compared virgin and pregnant mice with MS-like lesions introduced by lysolecithin, a chemical which destroys the myelin sheaths around neurons.
SNT.61058.4422	They found the pregnant mice developed smaller lesions and fewer damaged neurons, and showed signs of repaired neurons.
SNT.61058.4423	They also found the pregnant mice had higher levels of cells called oligodendrocytes, which create myelin and are able to repair some damaged neurons through remyelination.
SNT.61058.4424	Because prolactin regulates the levels of precursors of oligodendrocytes, the scientists hypothesized that prolactin levels were responsible for the differences in damage.
SNT.61058.4425	They also tested virgin mice given additional prolactin, and found results similar to pregnant mice.
SNT.61058.4426	Previous studies have shown that other hormones could reduce myelin damage, but this is the first study to show a mechanism to reverse myelin damage, and establish an empirical connection between that mechanism and pregnancy.
SNT.61058.4427	Dr. Weiss says, "It is thought that during pregnancy, women’s immune systems no longer destroyed the myelin."
SNT.61058.4428	"However, no previous study has tested whether pregnancy actually results in the production of new myelin, which may lead to improvement of symptoms."
SNT.61058.4429	"We're excited about this result because it suggests to us that prolactin has the potential to be used to enhance the production of new myelin."
SNT.61058.4430	Dr. William McIlroy, national medical advisor for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, explains the significance of this study: "The results of this study should be well received by people living with MS today."
SNT.61058.4431	"It represents a new insight of how we might be able to reverse some of the effects of the disease and improve the quality of life for those who live under its influence."
SNT.61058.4432	Dr. Luanne Metz, director of the Calgary MS Clinic in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary and Calgary Health Region, adds, "This discovery has the potential to take MS therapy a step further than current treatments that stabilize the disease in its early stages."
SNT.61058.4433	"By promoting repair, which is the goal of prolactin therapy, we have hope of actually improving symptoms in people with MS."
SNT.61058.4434	Further animal studies need to be done to examine the possibility of side effects, such as lactation in men and non-pregnant women, as well as increased inflammation which could worsen the MS.
SNT.61058.4435	Researchers believe human trials may begin within a few years.
SNT.61058.4436	Funding and support were provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Stem Cell Network.
SNT.61058.4437	MS is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where the body attacks the fatty myelin which helps nerves carry electrical signals, causing muscle weakness and spasming which may lead to disability.
SNT.61058.4438	MS affects approximately one of every 1000 people in North America, northern Europe and Australasia.
SNT.351723.4439	The microblogging service Twitter has changed its software support for censoring posts.
SNT.351723.4440	With the new updates, Twitter can now withdraw individual posts and accounts in specific countries, as opposed to a global deletion.
SNT.351723.4441	Twitter announced these changes in a blog post on Thursday, and released a clarification update on Friday.
SNT.351723.4442	Twitter says it needed to make the changes to expand on an international level.
SNT.351723.4443	It said in a blog post entitled Tweets still must flow, "we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression."
SNT.351723.4444	"Some differ so much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there."
SNT.351723.4445	"Others are similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content."
SNT.351723.4446	Twitter says it will use the new feature only "when required to do so in response to what we believe to be a valid and applicable legal request."
SNT.351723.4447	The new tools will give Twitter the ability to withdraw posts and entire accounts in selected countries.
SNT.351723.4448	Once the posts have been withdrawn, they are replaced with a message saying: "This Tweet/account has been withheld in: Country."
SNT.351723.4449	The social network has been used in the past as an outlet for political expression.
SNT.351723.4450	During the Arab Spring, protesters in various countries used Twitter to mobilize support and report information to the outside world.
SNT.351723.4451	The organization Reporters without Borders sent an open letter to Twitter's chairman, Jack Dorsey, saying "We urge you to reverse this decision, which restricts freedom of expression and runs counter to the movements opposed to censorship that have been linked to the Arab Spring, in which Twitter served as a sounding board..."
SNT.351723.4452	"Twitter is depriving cyberdissidents in repressive countries of a crucial tool for information and organization."
SNT.75222.4453	A military weapons storage facility in al-Masalmyiah, just north of Aleppo, Syria has exploded, killing at least 15 Syrian soldiers and injuring at least 50 others.
SNT.75222.4454	The explosion occurred on the grounds of a military academy's infantry school where weapons and ammunition are stored.
SNT.75222.4455	The blast, which occurred at 4:30 a.m. EEST (UTC+3) is believed to have been caused by excessive summer temperatures, but other reports suggest that a gas leak may have sparked the blast.
SNT.75222.4456	Firefighters report several deaths and injuries, but also said that the fires caused by the blast have been extinguished.
SNT.256494.4457	Tens of thousands of Syrians took to the streets Friday in cities across the country protesting for freedom.
SNT.256494.4458	Syria's official news agency (SANA) reported, "scattered groups of citizens came out to the streets in several areas of the provinces after Friday prayers and chanted slogans calling for freedom without the intervention of security forces."
SNT.256494.4459	However, protests in Damascus reportedly turned violent as security forces were said to disperse the crowds with batons and tear gas to prevent protesters reaching the capital's main square.
SNT.256494.4460	"I counted 15 mukhabarat [secret police] busloads," a source reported to Reuters news agency.
SNT.256494.4461	"They went into the alleyways just north of the square chasing protesters and yelling 'you pimps, you infiltrators, you want freedom? we will give it to you'."
SNT.256494.4462	Protests in Syria have intensified since mid-March after families of political prisoners held rallies in Damascus and people in Daraa protested against the arrests of more than a dozen children for anti-regime graffiti.
SNT.256494.4463	The protests continued as Syria’s President, Bashar al-Assad failed to lift the emergency law the country has operated under since his Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party came to power in 1963.
SNT.256494.4464	The Assad government has met protests with a mixture of minor concessions and force.
SNT.256494.4465	After a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Berlin, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, "The Syrian government did not meet the legitimate demands of the Syrian people."
SNT.256494.4466	"It is time for the Syrian government to stop its crack down on these people and begin to meet their aspirations."
SNT.256494.4467	The delegation asked for a deadline for their demands to be met.
SNT.256494.4468	Al Jazeera correspondent Rula Amin said, "It seems from the people in Daraa that the government is seriously trying to contain [the situation in] Daraa because that is where it all started."
SNT.256494.4469	"If they manage to calm the situation in Daraa, the government believes it will be able to contain the situation throughout Syria."
SNT.258475.4470	A three-year-old girl has been bitten by two dingoes while holidaying with her parents on Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia.
SNT.258475.4471	The two animals responsible for the attack have since been captured and euthanised by wildlife rangers.
SNT.258475.4472	The child was on the beach with her parents while they waited to be transported to the mainland on the Hook Point barge.
SNT.258475.4473	Witnesses report that the child wandered into nearby sand dunes where she was repeatedly bitten on the legs by the wild dogs.
SNT.258475.4474	Members of the Fraser Island Preservation group believe that the parents are to blame for the attack.
SNT.258475.4475	Spokeswoman Bree Jashin has stated the attack was the result of inattentiveness.
SNT.258475.4476	"The child was unsupervised and you have to ask how could a three-year-old get so close to the dingoes?"
SNT.258475.4477	Experts such as Environmental Department manager Terry Harper say the attack is uncharacteristic for the dingoes on Fraser Island which is said to be one of the last remaining safe havens for purebred dingoes.
SNT.258475.4478	"This is a very timely reminder for everybody about how important it is to stay very close to your children on Fraser Island," Harper stated.
SNT.258475.4479	The child received medical attention at the site of the attack and was then transported to Gympie Hospital.
SNT.85084.4480	A top US commander said yesterday that the United States is not planning a preemptive attack on Iran despite increasing rhetoric from Washington, D.C.
SNT.85084.4481	The United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also denied that an attack was imminent, stating that there is no Congressional authorization for military action against Iran.
SNT.85084.4482	The denials came as The Observer ran a report saying that US personnel involved in interrogating insurgents in Iraq are under "huge" pressure to find evidence against Iran.
SNT.85084.4483	It quoted Micah Brose, a privately contracted interrogator working for the US military there, as saying that information on Iran is "gold".
SNT.85084.4484	"They push a lot for us to establish a link with Iran," Brose claimed in the interview, adding that "it feels a lot like, if you get something and Iran's not involved, it's a let down."
SNT.85084.4485	He further claimed that people have said to him that "they're really pushing the Iran thing."
SNT.85084.4486	Brose denied being asked to manufacture evidence, but stated that "if a detainee wants to tell me what I want to hear so he can get out of jail ... you know what I'm saying."
SNT.85084.4487	The US has in the past been accused of using exaggerated and fabricated evidence to build its case against Iraq prior to the war.
SNT.85084.4488	The article by the British based newspaper said most military intelligence officers refused to comment but that one said "The message is, 'Got to find a link with Iran, got to find a link with Iran."
SNT.85084.4489	On Monday, Admiral William J. Fallon, the commanding officer of United States Central Command which is responsible for the Middle East, East Africa and Central Asia, speaking in Financial Times, said that a strike against Iran is "not in the offing."
SNT.85084.4490	"None of this is helped by the continuing stories that just keep going around and around and around that any day now there will be another war which is just not where we want to go," Fallon continued.
SNT.85084.4491	"Getting Iranian behavior to change and finding ways to get them to come to their senses and do that is the real objective."
SNT.85084.4492	"Attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice in my book."
SNT.85084.4493	Despite saying this, he refused to rule out a strike against Iran in the future.
SNT.85084.4494	Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was on ABC's This Week on Sunday, saying that a Senate resolution designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization does not authorize military action.
SNT.85084.4495	"There is nothing in this particular resolution that would suggest that from our point of view."
SNT.85084.4496	"And, clearly, the president has also made very clear that he's on a diplomatic path where Iran comes into focus," Rice said.
SNT.85084.4497	"This resolution is saying that there needs to be strong measures taken against Iran, which we have definitely done," Rice continued.
SNT.85084.4498	"And if the Iranians suspend their enrichment and reprocessing, I'm prepared to meet my counterpart anyplace, anytime, anywhere."
SNT.85084.4499	"So the question isn't why will we not talk to Tehran."
SNT.85084.4500	"The question is, why will Tehran not talk to us?"
SNT.85084.4501	Senator Hillary Clinton, who is running for President, voted for the resolution.
SNT.85084.4502	She has said that the resolution could not be used to justify war, but rather it seeks to escalate diplomatic efforts.
SNT.85084.4503	"We wish to emphasize that no congressional authority exists for unilateral military action against Iran," she said in an open letter on November 1, 2007.
SNT.85084.4504	Last week, former Foreign Minister of Germany, Joschka Fischer said that he was worried that the upcoming US Presidential election could heighten tensions between the US and Iran.
SNT.85084.4505	He found particularly worrisome a statement by Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani in October that "If I am President of the United States, I guarantee you, we will never find out what they will do if they get nuclear weapons, because they are not going to get a nuclear weapon ... the military option is not off the table."
SNT.84538.4506	The space shuttle Discovery is coming back to Earth after 11 days in orbit.
SNT.84538.4507	The a scan of the Shuttle's heat shield (now routine since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster) showed no cause for concern and Discovery was cleared for the voyage home.
SNT.84538.4508	The mission's primary purposes were to deliver the Harmony module to the International Space Station and to help reposition and extend solar power arrays.
SNT.84538.4509	The mission gained wide attention for including a space walk to repair damage in the solar power array.
SNT.84538.4510	The space walk had not been planned until the mission was already underway when the damage was then detected.
SNT.84538.4511	However, additional problems with a rotary joint were not repaired and if they are not repaired they could interfere with further station construction.
SNT.84538.4512	The return will also bring back Clay Anderson who is being replaced on the International Space Station by Dan Tani.
SNT.84538.4513	Discovery is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space Center at 1:02 PM EST (UTC-5) on November 7.
SNT.75158.4514	Three people were hospitalized with injuries after a series of explosions at Southwest Industrial Gases, Inc., a gas facility in Dallas, Texas.
SNT.75158.4515	Tanks of oxygen, helium and acetylene began to explode after a connector used to join acetylene tanks during the filling process malfunctioned.
SNT.75158.4516	The explosions sent flaming debris into the air and onto buildings and expressways.
SNT.75158.4517	Black smoke that could be seen for miles billowed from the facility.
SNT.75158.4518	The problem began around 9:30 a.m CDT (UTC-5) at a loading dock, according to Dallas Fire Department Lt. Joel Lavender, and then spread to a trailer housing some 100,000 cubic feet (approximately 28,300 cubic metres) of gas.
SNT.75158.4519	Authorities evacuated an area that was one-half of a mile (approximately 800 m) wide.
SNT.75158.4520	Portions of Interstate 35 and Interstate 30 were shut down.
SNT.75158.4521	Flaming debris ignited small grass fires next to the roads.
SNT.75158.4522	Tanks were reported to have landed as far away as four blocks.
SNT.75158.4523	Officials for the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as local and state environmental officials, have deemed air quality levels acceptable following the blast.
SNT.75158.4524	Hazardous material crews have blocked water used in the fire from entering the Dallas storm drains.
SNT.75158.4525	"I just advised my teams to get out," said Eddy Parker of Airgas which operates right next to Southwest Industrial.
SNT.75158.4526	"Then we turned and ran and just kept hearing explosions."
SNT.75158.4527	"Given the fact that there haven’t been any fatalities, it seems like our fire department and emergency responders did a great job."
SNT.75158.4528	"But we need to let the fire department look at why this is occurring there in that area," said City Councilman Steve Salazar.
SNT.75158.4529	Two of the injured men, Randal Bibb, 52, and Daniel McMurry, 56, were taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital to be treated for upper-body burns.
SNT.75158.4530	The third, an unidentified truck-driver, was treated and released at Methodist Dallas Medical Center.
SNT.75158.4531	He hurt his back when he jumped from the cab of his truck.
SNT.76438.4532	Eight Hungarian migrant workers sacked from a Domino's Pizza franchise in Derby, England are said to have taken home virtually no pay for months because of illegal deductions.
SNT.76438.4533	The claim is refuted by the company who said in a statement "We have begun a thorough investigation during which we have scrutinised the franchisee's employment practices."
SNT.76438.4534	"The franchisee concerned is confident that he possesses the evidence required to refute these allegations."
SNT.76438.4535	"To the extent that we have been informed of all allegations and have reviewed all available evidence, we also believe this to be the case."
SNT.76438.4536	The sacked workers are being supported in their claim by the workers union Unite.
SNT.76438.4537	The union say the "there appeared to be a deliberate strategy of keeping the workers in debt to the company through a series of crippling deductions."
SNT.76438.4538	"The deductions included payments to cover the contract purchase of a car from their employer, insurance for the vehicle provided through their employer, and exorbitant rent for substandard accommodation, again provided through their employer."
SNT.76438.4539	In addition, some workers had to pay fees of up to £180 for an "introduction" to the company.
SNT.76438.4540	One worker earned just £5 in four months because of the constant and hefty deductions out of his wage packet.
SNT.81841.4541	On Friday morning, United States President George W. Bush defended interrogation tactics used by the CIA, stating that "This government does not torture people."
SNT.81841.4542	Bush's comments were a response to an article in Thursday's New York Times describing a classified 2005 Justice Department legal opinion that endorsed the use of painful physical and psychological tactics against terror suspects.
SNT.81841.4543	Bush also claimed that "the techniques that we used have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of the US Congress."
SNT.81841.4544	According to anonymous sources cited in The New York Times article, the classified 2005 legal opinion contained "an expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency," and explicitly authorized the use of tactics including head-slapping, frigid temperatures, and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding against terror suspects.
SNT.81841.4545	White House spokeswoman Dana Perino confirmed the existence of the 2005 document but did not say whether techniques such as head slapping and waterboarding constitute "torture" under U.S. law.
SNT.81841.4546	"I'm not going to get into specific tactics," Perino said.
SNT.81841.4547	She added that disclosing specific interrogation methods could reduce the effectiveness of those methods by allowing terrorists to train to resist them.
SNT.81841.4548	Democrats expressed frustration with the Bush administration's secrecy on the issue of interrogation tactics.
SNT.81841.4549	"The administration can’t have it both ways," said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
SNT.81841.4550	"They can’t say that Congress has been fully briefed while refusing to turn over key documents used to justify the legality of the program."
SNT.351544.4551	Four journalists from The Sun newspaper and one police officer have been arrested today as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into payments by journalists working at News International to police officers.
SNT.351544.4552	The police officer has been identified as a 29-year-old officer in the Territorial Policing Command at the Metropolitan Police.
SNT.351544.4553	The police have not identified the journalists, but the BBC suggest they are Fergus Shanahan, ex-deputy editor of The Sun; Graham Dudman, ex-managing editor; Mike Sullivan, crime editor; and Chris Pharo, head of news.
SNT.351544.4554	The Metropolitan Police have said News Corporation disclosed information leading to the arrests.
SNT.351544.4555	The offices of News International at Wapping have also been searched today as part of the investigation.
SNT.351544.4556	Operation Elveden has now arrested a total of fourteen people: 12 journalists and two police officers.
SNT.30953.4557	Marek is the editor of a regional weekly newspaper, the Wiesci Polickie (news from the town of Police).
SNT.30953.4558	In February 2001, he published an article alleging that a local municipal employee, who privately ran an advertising agency, had a conflict of interest in which he profited from his position to obtain business for his agency.
SNT.30953.4559	Upon appeal in November 2003, he had the three-month prison sentence suspended on the condition that he apologise to the libellee.
SNT.30953.4560	Marek refused to apologise and applied for a presidential pardon in March 2004.
SNT.30953.4561	On March 23, 2004, a court in Szczecin suspended the application of the sentence by six months due to problems with Marek's wife's pregnancy.
SNT.30953.4562	Reporters sans frontières claims that Poland is the only European Union country in which prison sentences are imposed for "offences of opinion" and that this is the first such occurrence in the EU.

SNT.19482.4568	From February to May, Grant obtained pills from 28 doctors and 22 pharmacies in Peel and Halton regions.
SNT.19482.4569	The Workers' Compensation Board of Nova Scotia defines "double doctoring" "as a situation where a [person] seeks or obtains a prescription for a controlled drug or narcotic from more than one doctor to treat the same condition for the same period of time."
SNT.130425.4570	A Kam Air plane from Afghanistan, traveling in China's Xinjiang region was not hijacked and did not receive a bomb threat, according to Afghan officials.
SNT.130425.4571	Earlier the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported a plane to be hijacked.
SNT.130425.4572	Later reports then stated the plane received a bomb threat and was diverted back to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar.
SNT.130425.4573	The early reports say the plane was diverted back to Afghanistan after being denied an emergency landing in Ürümqi.
SNT.130425.4574	The plane was traveling to China and had been ordered to turn around after the proper paperwork was not in place.
SNT.130425.4575	Upon its return, the plane landed in Kabul after it encountered high winds.
SNT.130425.4576	It is not known how many people were on board the plane, but no injuries are reported.

SNT.109599.4579	Apple's new 3G iPhone was introduced to consumers in 21 nations on Friday, but its first sales day was marred by minimal supplies and sluggish phone activations.
SNT.109599.4580	Systems which enable the iPhones for service had difficulty due to network failures and insufficient capacity to meet the demand for first-day sales, particularly in the United States at Apple and AT&T stores, and in Canada.
SNT.109599.4581	Long lineups of customers were waiting at Australian stores for the first day of iPhone sales there, where the phone is supported by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone.
SNT.109599.4582	Crowds also lined up in Japan where the iPhone was unavailable for sale until now.
SNT.109599.4583	The iPhone was sold to Canadians for the first time through Rogers Wireless stores.
SNT.109599.4584	Rogers has exclusive rights to the iPhone in Canada since it is the only national wireless carrier that supports the iPhone's transmission standards.
SNT.109599.4585	Earlier complaints about high iPhone rates did not deter hundreds of would-be Canadian iPhone buyers who lined up hours before store opening times.
SNT.109599.4586	They soon learned, however, that the new phones were in short supply, and like other countries experienced delays in activating the phones.
SNT.109599.4587	A CBC News survey found that the most expensive basic iPhone service was in Italy for Vodafone customers at an equivalent US$2554 for a two-year contract.
SNT.109599.4588	Canada's Rogers was the second most expensive at US$2176 for a three-year term.

SNT.48561.4591	Internal Iraqi forces had lost control of parts of Diwaniya city in Iraq's south after members of the Mehdi Army rejected a call to participate in peace negotiations.
SNT.48561.4592	In response the Mehdi Army setup checkpoints in parts of the city, sparking the violence that saw the Iraqi government send in large numbers of reinforcements to re-take control of the city.
SNT.48561.4593	In Baghdad a mid-morning blast injured about a dozen people, and killing at least eight police officers.
SNT.48561.4594	The blast was aimed at the heavily securied Iraqi Interior Ministry, which has been the frequent target of attacks.
SNT.48561.4595	This morning's violence contrasted statements by Maj Gen William Caldwell, who claimed "Insurgents and terrorists are hitting back in an attempt to offset the success of the Iraqi government and its security forces," the general went on to say that violence had fallen by half since July, but had increased suddenly in the last two days.
SNT.48561.4596	Yesterday five US soldiers were killed in three separate bombing incidents, killing four and one respectively, the US military announced today.

SNT.48561.4598	Calls to partition the country are becoming louder, bringing into question the future of Iraq as a unified state.
SNT.48561.4599	The assassination of the chief prosecutor in Saddam Hussein's trial for genocide highlights the deep divisions between Iraq's cultural factions, lending creedance to speculation that Iraq has a long way to go before the safety of civilians can be assured.
SNT.48561.4600	Factions still loyal to the Hussein Regieme remain under cover, undermining the reported progress of western forces.
SNT.35211.4601	On Wednesday March 8, North Korea launched two surface-to-air missiles, during military training exercises near the border with China, according to Kyodo News which cited two military sources.
SNT.35211.4602	An "Asian security source" stated that the missiles may have been launched in the direction of China by mistake, and landed just inside the North Korean border.
SNT.35211.4603	A "Western military source", however, claimed that they were launched to the east, in the direction of the Sea of Japan, but still says they landed in North Korean territory.
SNT.35211.4604	North Korea surprised the world when it launched a ballistic missile over northern Japan in 1998.
SNT.35211.4605	Since then, it has conducted many missile tests, including a dense battery of land-to-ship missile tests in 2003 when tensions rose over its possible possession of nuclear weapons.
SNT.35211.4606	It is believed to be developing a ballistic missile that could reach Alaska, Hawaii, or even the continental United States.
SNT.102949.4607	Puerto Rico is a semi-autonomous territory of the United States.
SNT.102949.4608	The U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodríguez of the District of Puerto Rico said that, because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, the Governor himself will not be arrested immediately and will be given a chance to "give himself up to the police."
SNT.102949.4609	Some of the other people charged, however, have already been arrested and await trial.
SNT.102949.4610	The 13 defendants are charged with conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, federal program fraud and tax crimes related to the financing for the Governor's 1999-2002 campaigns for Resident Commissioner, the sole representative of the island in the U.S. Congress, and for his subsequent 2004 gubernatorial run.
SNT.102949.4611	This indictment comes after a two-year investigation by a Grand Jury of donations made to the Governor's past campaigns.
SNT.102949.4612	The defendants face three to ten years in federal prison, as well as several $100,000 to $250,000 fines.
SNT.9321.4613	Sharansky’s resignation as Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Jerusalem was accepted by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at Sunday’s cabinet meeting.
SNT.9321.4614	"The only aim of the current government is the implementation of the disengagement plan, and therefore it is wrong, even immoral, for me to remain a part of this government."
SNT.9321.4615	Sharansky said that although he was always against what he calls the "so-called disengagement plan," he decided to leave the government once the battle against the withdrawal was no longer able to be waged from within the government.
SNT.9321.4616	"Our main battle now is public opinion, because the struggle in the government is finished," he said.
SNT.9321.4617	Although he hopes to take the struggle to the people, the former minister hopes his move will pave the way for other politicians to follow their consciences.
SNT.9321.4618	"I don’t know how effective my quitting will be," Sharansky said, "but I hope it will encourage other politicians and ministers to at least vote according to what they believe and what they think."
SNT.9321.4619	The former prisoner of Zion (who served time in a Soviet prison for wanting to emigrate to Israel) says his main objection to the plan to withdraw from Gaza and northern Samaria is the fact that the withdrawal is not contingent on the creation of democracy within the Palestinian Authority.
SNT.9321.4620	"I have promoted the spread of democracy as the only answer for thirty years."
SNT.9321.4621	"And now, at the time when an American president declares these principles and promotes them, an Israeli PM comes along and does the exact opposite."
SNT.9321.4622	Although he has in the past supported withdrawal from parts of the land of Israel, Sharansky says the current plan goes too far.
SNT.9321.4623	"We cannot control another people and we will need serious compromise, but that compromise does not include giving another people the ability to destroy us…as if we run from Gaza, Gaza will not run after us."
SNT.9321.4624	"I had many opportunities to present my point of view to the Prime Minister, both publicly and privately," Sharansky said.
SNT.9321.4625	"I told him we will not have ten years – we will not even have ten days free from pressure, because we are legitimizing one-sided withdrawals from Jewish areas – each withdrawal will only invite more pressure."
SNT.9321.4626	"We are speaking about three generations of Jews that were sent on the important mission by the Israeli government and made an empty desert into a blossoming garden."
SNT.9321.4627	"Now we will just destroy all these beautiful communities, with their unique agriculture and incredible Judaism - for what?" Sharansky asks.
SNT.60319.4628	Violent clashes have broken out between Palestinians and Israeli police near the al-Aqsa Mosque and Temple Mount in Jerusalem, from controversy over Israeli construction near the site, which is holy to both Muslims and Jews.
SNT.60319.4629	The construction work reportedly is to repair a pedestrian bridge that leads to the Mugrabi Gate, the entrance to the mosque used by Palestinians, and runs over the Jewish Western Wall area of the complex.
SNT.60319.4630	The earthen ramp bridge leads to a hilltop compound known as the Temple Mount to Jews and as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims.
SNT.60319.4631	The bridge collapsed in 2004 and was temporarily replaced with a wooden bridge which Israelis say is weakening and unsafe.
SNT.60319.4632	Israel has controlled the contentious compound since the 1967 Mideast War,
SNT.60319.4633	The construction involves excavation work and digging at the site, which Palestinian leaders contend is part of an attempt to dig under the mosque to find evidence of the Jewish Second Temple and/or to deliberately weaken the foundation of the mosque.
SNT.60319.4634	Muslims dispute that the Temple was located at the site.
SNT.60319.4635	Israeli forces locked down Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem in anticipation of backlashes from the construction.
SNT.60319.4636	The Old Jerusalem city limits were blockaded, allowing only Palestinians over 45 years old from entering and only on foot.
SNT.60319.4637	Opponents have declared the blockades and the construction work a deliberate act to prevent Muslims from accessing the holy site.
SNT.60319.4638	The mass of protesters at the site have in turn blocked Jewish access to the Western Wall.
SNT.60319.4639	Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas declared the construction and blockade as "hostile measures" against Muslims.
SNT.60319.4640	Palestinian chief justice Tayssir al-Tamimi declared a "day of anger" and called on Palestinians to defend the mosque.
SNT.60319.4641	Arab and Muslim countries including Jordan, Malaysia and Indonesia criticized Israel for the controversial work and urged it to halt construction.
SNT.60319.4642	Israeli defense minister Amir Peretz also warned against starting construction.
SNT.60319.4643	The leader of the Pakistan Muslim League urged Muslim countries to freeze diplomatic ties with Israel in protest of the work.
SNT.60319.4644	Around 150 Muslims were inside the mosque for morning prayers when the construction and blockade began.
SNT.60319.4645	An Israeli Muslim journalist reported that the worshippers were unable to leave and received loud messages from Israeli loudspeakers.
SNT.60319.4646	Conventional Judaism believes it is also the historic site of the First and Second Temples, the holiest temple in Judaism, which is prophesised to be rebuilt ahead of the coming of the Messiah.
SNT.60319.4647	No deaths have been reported in the clashes, which simmered by evening.
SNT.60319.4648	Demonstrations also took place at mosques throughout the Muslim world, including Egypt and Jordan.
SNT.60319.4649	The incident comes only a few days after rival Palestinian political factions, Hamas and Fatah, came to an agreement for a unity government aimed at restoring international support of Palestine and a return to Israeli negotiations.
SNT.59522.4650	Barbaro, winner of the 2006 Kentucky Derby, was euthanized on the morning of January 29, according to co-owner Roy Jackson.
SNT.59522.4651	Barbaro suffered a major injury to his right hind leg shortly after the start of the 2006 Preakness Stakes.
SNT.59522.4652	According to Jackson, "We just reached a point where it was going to be difficult for him to go on without pain."
SNT.59522.4653	"It was the right decision, it was the right thing to do."
SNT.59522.4654	"We said all along if there was a situation where it would become more difficult for him then it would be time."
SNT.59522.4655	Barbaro's right hind leg was shattered in the opening lengths of the Preakness race.
SNT.59522.4656	Three bones in the leg were broken - the cannon bone, the sesamoid bone, and the pastern bone.
SNT.59522.4657	Laminitis took hold in the left hind leg as a result of the extra weight borne on the leg by the horse.
SNT.59522.4658	It appeared for a while that Barbaro would recover; however, earlier this month, the horse suffered two significant setbacks that greatly reduced his ultimate chances for survival.
SNT.59522.4659	The three-year-old colt underwent emergency surgery on May 20 to fuse two joints in the damaged right leg.
SNT.59522.4660	Further surgery was required on January 27 to insert two steel pins into one of the healed bones.
SNT.59522.4661	The latest procedure was especially risky because it transferred more weight on to the leg, with the foot resting on the ground not bearing any weight.
SNT.59522.4662	The right rear hoof was already deteriorating, having developed a painful abscess earlier in the week.
SNT.19996.4663	The wreck of the plane ATR72 that fell into the sea near Sicily, Italy on August 6 has been recovered.
SNT.19996.4664	One of the two black boxes that contained the communication recording, and the complete set of instruments and commands in the cockpit, was recovered.
SNT.19996.4665	One of the three people who were still missing from the accident was found, while there is yet no sign of the other two persons.
SNT.19996.4666	The identity of the recovered corpse is not yet known (and the identification is expected to be difficult).
SNT.19996.4667	A survey published today by the Italian association Intesaconsumatori (Union of Consumers) said that 61% of Italians are afraid to fly, while 41% of population feels less safe about plane safety than they did one month earlier.
SNT.19996.4668	According to the survey, 20% would be ready to get off the plane, or refuse to get in the plane, if they found that the airline is different from the one they were told when they bought the ticket.
SNT.21086.4669	The German city of Munich has delayed the start of its planed migration to Linux till 2006.
SNT.21086.4670	The migration was originally due to start this year, three years after the decision to migrate to Linux was made.
SNT.21086.4671	Peter Hofmann, the project leader of the migration said the delay was because the "pilot was more important than we first thought and should last longer."
SNT.21086.4672	Once the pilot is completed all the departments will eventually be migrated to Linux and OpenOffice.org.
SNT.21086.4673	On May 28, 2003 Germany's third-largest city, voted to move to open source software.
SNT.21086.4674	Munich made the decision to switch after Microsoft discontinued support for their current OS, Windows NT 4.
SNT.21086.4675	While Suse was very involved in the early phases, Debian was ultimately selected to replace Windows on 14,000 desktops.
SNT.21086.4676	The migration is estimated to cost between 30 and 34 million euros, once complete would affect approximately 16,000 users.
SNT.21086.4677	The first department to migrate to Linux and OpenOffice.org will be the office of the Lord Mayor planed for the middle of 2006, though not all of the department's computers will be immediately migrated.
SNT.21086.4678	Peter Hofmann said "Some departments will start with OpenOffice on Windows, others will start with OpenOffice on Linux".
SNT.37764.4679	The President of the Hellenic Republic, Carolos Papoulias, attended the inauguration ceremony of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation in Alexandria, Egypt.
SNT.37764.4680	The ceremony was blessed by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew.
SNT.37764.4681	Also attending, in addition to the Greek President, were two ministers of the Greek government, a former Prime Minister of Greece, many Greek businessmen and the Orthodox bishops of Africa.
SNT.37764.4682	The development of the Church of the Annunciation in Alexandria has been financed by the Onassis Foundation.
SNT.37764.4683	Tomorrow, President Papoulias will meet unofficially in Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
SNT.438233.4684	The United Nations has confirmed that its convoy in Syria was bombed this afternoon while a human rights group reported a Syrian military attack on civilians at a nearby funeral in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province today.
SNT.438233.4685	Just prior to the bombing of the UN convoy at around 1400 Eastern European Time (UTC+2), the Syrian military is said to have attacked a funeral procession and reportedly 20 people were killed in that incident.
SNT.438233.4686	The attack on civilians by the Syrian military was reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
SNT.438233.4687	According to Martin Nesirky, who is the UN spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, an IED bomb struck its four-vehicle convoy.
SNT.438233.4688	UN personnel had to be left behind after the blast but no UN staff were injured.
SNT.438233.4689	Later, the UN sent a patrol to pick up personnel left behind.
SNT.438233.4690	A video uploaded to the video sharing website YouTube reportedly shows the UN convoy being targeted and bombed.
SNT.438233.4691	About a dozen civilians can be seen surrounding the lead car of the convoy talking to UN observers.
SNT.438233.4692	Several seconds later, a bomb explodes near what appears to be the lead car of the convoy severely damaging the front end of the vehicle and injuring several civilians.
SNT.438233.4693	The lead car, still operating, begins to leave the area.
SNT.438233.4694	According to reports, several civilians were injured and or killed in the attack.
SNT.438233.4695	The UN has reportedly stated that none of their observers were injured.
SNT.438233.4696	"We went to observe and after a while shooting occurred; We are safe with the Free Army and we are waiting for a [U.N.] group to pick us up," said UN observers to Reuters.
SNT.438233.4697	According to reports, the UN is seeking "to remove the observers from the area."
SNT.438233.4698	It is not yet known who was responsible for the attack on the UN convoy.
SNT.38339.4699	Yesterday, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile, appeared before the Cole Inquiry into kickbacks paid to Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime.
SNT.38339.4700	It is the first time in over a decade that a senior government official has been called to give evidence before a royal commission in Australia.
SNT.38339.4701	The inquiry heard that Mr Vaile could not recall being told any specific details of the allegations made against the wheat exporter AWB before 2003, and despite his department receiving information about the allegations, it came as no surprise that he was not informed as he held no responsibility for the UN Oil-for-Food program.
SNT.38339.4702	Mr Vaile has been Australia's trade minister since 2000 and the deputy prime minister since 2005.
SNT.38339.4703	Mr Vaile told the commission that despite the cables received by his department in 2000 alleging that the AWB agreed to pay a kickback to Hussein's regime in Iraq, inflating wheat prices and paying money into another non-Iraqi account, he does not recollect being told specific details of the allegations.
SNT.38339.4704	When asked by counsel assisting the commission John Agius about how such cables are dealt with, Mr Vaile told the commission that they are looked at by department officers who decide whether or not they need the minister's attention.
SNT.38339.4705	Mr Vaile said that if a particular cable needed his attention it was generally put into a ministerial submission.
SNT.38339.4706	He said that such submissions may require ministerial action, while others just contain information which he may need to make a note of.
SNT.38339.4707	Once the submission has been read, the minister signs it and it goes into the system.
SNT.38339.4708	Mr Vaile told the commission that on occasion he receives information from cables via briefings from his advisors and departmental officers.
SNT.38339.4709	When questioned about a cable sent to the department of trade containing concerns raised by the UN about AWB's dealings in Iraq dated January 13, 2000, Mr Vaile said that he was briefed in a general sense on the issues raised.
SNT.38339.4710	Despite the UN's concerns being stated in the cable, Mr Vaile said that he "can't recall being aware of the substance".
SNT.38339.4711	Mr Vaile said he was under the belief that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Australia's UN mission were taking care of the UN's concerns.
SNT.38339.4712	He said that he did not have responsibility over the issues being raised．
SNT.38339.4712-2	 "That's my recollection, and my recollection is that there were concerns that had been raised about an AWB contract, and that DFAT and the Mission in New York were dealing with it, bearing in mind that I was not - I didn't have direct ministerial responsibility for either the UN Mission in New York or the Oil-for-Food Program" he said.
SNT.38339.4713	When asked if he would have expected to be briefed in detail on the issues in the cable, Mr Vaile said "Given the circumstances at the time, in terms of my direct ministerial responsibility and being new in the portfolio, probably not."
SNT.38339.4714	Mr Vaile told the inquiry that he was surprised that he had not been briefed about a cable dated March 11, 2000 from Austrade to the department of trade.
SNT.38339.4715	The summary of the document said "It may be necessary to advise the minister of the situation."
SNT.38339.4716	The inquiry heard that in April, 2000 Mr Vaile was told by an advisor that the issue raised in January, 2000 had been resolved with the UN.
SNT.38339.4717	When questioned by Mr Agius about why he did not follow up on the allegations made against AWB in 2000, Mr Vaile said he was too snowed under with work.
SNT.38339.4718	"My best recollections are that I was pretty well snowed under in taking on the responsibilities of a new portfolio and the breadth of issues, having come from a much narrower base in the previous portfolio, and I recall early in 2000 being very, very focused on what to do next in the WTO process after the Seattle ministerial failed in the December of 1999," he told the inquiry.
SNT.38339.4719	Mr Agius then questioned Mr Vaile about allegations made by US Wheat Associates in 2003 that AWB had been inflating wheat prices to Iraq.
SNT.38339.4720	At the same time there were also allegations that money was being paid to Hussein's regime, that AWB was not being transparent in their dealings.
SNT.38339.4721	At the time Mr Vaile defended AWB based upon information provided to him by his department.
SNT.38339.4722	He claims that it was some time later that he learned the information he was given was provided to the department by AWB.
SNT.38339.4723	Mr Vaile said that his department did not conduct an investigation into the allegations despite them being raised in 2000 and again in 2003 by separate parties.
SNT.38339.4724	Mr Vaile also admits that at the time, he dismissed the allegations made by US Wheat Associates as he believed that they were putting pressure on the US administration with regards to WTO negotiations between Australia and the US.
SNT.38339.4725	Mr Vaile told the inquiry that the first he became aware of possible corruption with connected with AWB was in April, 2004.
SNT.38339.4726	The inquiry heard that Mr Vaile and Alexander Downer (Australia's foreign minister) had received a submission claiming that AWB had acted properly, but the company they paid to transport wheat in Iraq had been paying kickbacks to Hussein's regime.
SNT.38339.4727	Mr Vaile said that at the time he saw no need to review procedures within his department for the distribution of information regarding AWB.
SNT.38339.4728	According to Mr Vaile, the only time the department of trade investigated its files to locate information it had received on AWB's dealings in Iraq was around March 2004 to assist the UN's inquiry into the Oil-for-Food programme.

SNT.60723.4738	Plymouth, Michigan, United States - This week, independent software developer Stardock released Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar, an expansion to their PC turn-based strategy game Dread Lords.
SNT.60723.4739	Industry websites IGN and GameSpy responded with Editors' Choice awards, while UGO gave it an A.
SNT.60723.4740	The expansion had previously been named as one of GameSpy's Most Wanted Games of 2007.
SNT.60723.4741	Reviewers cited the significant increase in customization options, better artificial intelligence, and an improvement in graphics quality as decisive factors.
SNT.60723.4742	UGO's Adam Swiderski noted that "if creating a fleet of death-dealing starships sounds like fun to you (and it really should), this is your dream playground," while GameSpy's reviewer suggested that "after a week of playing Dark Avatar, you may forget Master of Orion altogether."
SNT.60723.4743	Criticism mostly revolved around "uninspired" ground combat, a too-generic tech tree, and the continued lack of multiplayer support.
SNT.60723.4744	The original game received some publicity for its lack of copy protection, but gained far more by the actions of a StarForce forum administrator, who made a post linking to an illegal BitTorrent download of the game.
SNT.60723.4745	StarForce developer Protection Technology later claimed this to be a poorly-considered attempt to demonstrate the result of not using their software, which is designed to prevent software piracy.
SNT.60723.4746	The result was a media backlash against the company, including satirical commentary by gaming webcomic/blog Penny Arcade describing the action as "extortion."
SNT.60723.4747	Its writer, Jerry Holkins, asked that "publishers distance themselves from a company that has shown such contempt for their industry."
SNT.60723.4748	The expansion is available as an online purchase in CD or digital download form through Stardock's gaming subsidiary, TotalGaming.net.
SNT.60723.4749	A compilation of the original and expansion has also been released as Galactic Civilizations II: Gold Edition and is available in stores, say Stardock.
SNT.60723.4750	Their retail game releases still contain no copy protection, but online activation is required to download updates.

SNT.26052.4782	The police reported 284 vehicles being torched in petrol bomb attacks on Sunday, the 18th consecutive night of the riots.
SNT.26052.4783	The number is lower than the previous night, when 374 cars were destroyed, and considerably below previous week's peak of 1,400.
SNT.26052.4784	Chirac, who has been criticized for keeping a low profile during the crisis, prepared to address the nation on Monday night in a television broadcast.
SNT.26052.4785	Chirac was quoted by a government spokesman as saying that the emergency powers were "strictly temporary and will only be applied where they are strictly necessary."
SNT.26052.4786	In spite of all departmental prefects being authorised to impose curfews, in practice only few have.
SNT.26052.4787	The extension of powers has drawn some criticism from local mayors who have deemed it an overreaction and potentially inflammatory.
SNT.26052.4788	The pressure group SOS Racisme said that events had shown that the prefects already had enough powers.
SNT.26052.4789	Since the beginning of the unrest on October 27, more than 8,000 cars have been torched, more than 2,700 people arrested and dozens of buildings wrecked.
SNT.26052.4790	According to José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission, the European Union is prepared to release 50 million € in aid for damaged areas.

SNT.18113.4797	In a televised Pentagon press briefing Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stood by a press release from the Pentagon on Monday that reported explosives and bombs crossed into Iraq from across the Iranian border.
SNT.18113.4798	It is true that weapons, clearly, unambiguously from Iran have been found in Iraq, Rumsfeld said today.
SNT.18113.4799	Evidence reportedly indicated the quality and sophistication of the weapons was such that they may have been manufactured in Iran, but Rumsfeld was unable or unwilling to describe the weapons further.
SNT.18113.4800	Timing of the Pentagon release coincides with the controversy over Iran restarting its nuclear facilities.
SNT.18113.4801	Rumsfeld, with the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staffs, Richard Myers, said the jihadist effort in Iraq was aimed at inciting civil war, since they realize they cannot directly defeat the coalition.
SNT.18113.4802	Speaking on the issue of border crossings of troops and munitions from Syria and Iran, Rumsfeld implied that those nations don't want progress in to be made in Iraq.
SNT.18113.4803	The two cited progress by the Iraqi government in working toward the August 15 deadline for drafting a new constitution.
SNT.18113.4804	In a nod to the possibility that the deadline will be missed, it was said that the constitution could be amended, and that voting on ratification would occur in October of this year, with a general election to follow in December.
SNT.18113.4805	Myers referred to a shift in the Sunni participation in the process, saying, "All indications are that the Sunni leadership in Iraq has made a fundamental decision that they want to be part of the process."
SNT.18113.4806	They reasserted previous President Bush statements that there is no clear time-table for an Iraqi withdrawal because it depends on the situation at the time.
SNT.18113.4807	The drawdowns that will occur eventually will obviously be based on those conditions.
SNT.18113.4808	Further questions by reporters intending to pin down a clear withdrawal time-line were rebuffed.
SNT.18113.4809	Myers said, "You have economic progress that has to be made; you have political progress that has to be made."
SNT.18113.4810	He added that "173,000 Iraqi security forces" are in place in the country, but along with work on the country's infrastructure, much remains to be done with the training and equipping of their security forces.
SNT.41477.4811	These are figures from a nationwide telephone survey of 1200 individuals conducted by Zogby International from Friday, May 12 through Tuesday, May 16, 2006.
SNT.41477.4812	The results have a margin of sampling error of +/- 2.9.
SNT.41477.4813	The poll was commissioned by 911truth.org, a single issue website aimed at pinning the blame of 9/11 on the Bush administration.
SNT.41477.4814	The results of this Zogby poll were released last Monday (22 May), but went largely unreported by the mass media, possibly due to bias within the source.
SNT.252355.4815	Yesterday the Health Ministry claimed that China issued a national ban on smoking in all indoor public spaces.
SNT.252355.4816	The ban is included in the government's 12th Five-Year Plan.
SNT.252355.4817	Also banned is smoking in outdoor public areas where pedestrians pass.
SNT.252355.4818	China, with a third of the world's smoking population at 300 million smokers, is the largest cigarette market in the world.
SNT.252355.4819	Each week approximately 70 percent of non-smoking adults are exposed to second-hand smoke.
SNT.252355.4820	According the the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, tobacco-related illnesses kill over one million people annually.
SNT.252355.4821	The World Health Organisation says Chinese smoking-related deaths account for one fifth of deaths from smoking world-wide.
SNT.252355.4822	The number of deaths are predicted to rise to 3.5 million deaths a year by 2030 if no steps are taken, states a report co-authored by Zhao Ping, deputy director general of the Chinese Cancer Foundation.
SNT.252355.4823	Further, there is a spike of new smokers in China as increasingly women, young people and the poor become smokers.
SNT.252355.4824	The posting of logos is being required to alert people not to smoke.
SNT.252355.4825	Vending machines selling cigarettes in public places will be banned as will cigarette advertisements and sponsorships.
SNT.252355.4826	The new regulations include educational measures to inform people about the dangers of tobacco.
SNT.149876.4827	A car bomb exploded today at the gates of a U.S. military base, just outside the Afghan capital of Kabul.
SNT.149876.4828	The incident occurred just outside an US installation dubbed "Camp Phoenix".
SNT.149876.4829	This is mainly used by American troops which train Afghan security forces.
SNT.149876.4830	Camp Phoenix is often attacked by insurgents, particularly suicide bombers.
SNT.149876.4831	In mid-November, an attack in Camp Phoenix, injured 25 people, half of them American soldiers.
SNT.149876.4832	The Taliban was the group that claimed responsibility for the attack.
SNT.149876.4833	A spokesperson for the bombers, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed in a telephone interview that the bomber had allegedly "killed and wounded" ten American soldiers and demolished three military vehicles.
SNT.149876.4834	Asked about that claim, an American military spokeswoman, Air Force Master Sgt. Sabrina D. Foster, said that a statement would be issued soon but that in the meantime she could confirm only eight United States personnel with minor wounds.
SNT.149876.4836	According to Kabul police chief, Abdul Rahman, three of those injured were American interpreters.
SNT.149876.4837	Sayed Abdul Ghafar, head of the criminal investigation, Kabul police, said the explosion demolished at least eleven civilian vehicles in the adjoining area.
SNT.149876.4838	Eight were wounded, most of whom were day laborers who generally would be leaving the base after a day's work.
SNT.149876.4839	All were reported to be stable by Interior Ministry spokesman, Zemary Bashary.
SNT.149876.4840	"The target of the suicide attacker seemed to be foreign forces, but we couldn’t see any American vehicle damaged there because the road was blocked by American forces."
SNT.149876.4841	"We don’t know exactly the casualties among the foreign forces," said Ghafar.
SNT.149876.4842	"The American troops soon blocked the area, and barred access to the highway."
SNT.149876.4843	"They won’t even let the Afghan National Police near it," said an Afghan policeman near the place where the attack occurred.
SNT.149876.4844	It was the first suicide bombing in Kabul since January 18.
SNT.149876.4845	In the previous attack, several bombs had been detonated by the attackers, who also fought with Afghan commandos.
SNT.149876.4846	The situation was brought under control soon; however five people were killed.
SNT.149876.4847	Earlier today, Afghan intelligence officials provided another statement about this attack; this statement is probably the one with most details.
SNT.149876.4848	During a news conference, they showed a video which was about an Afghan man arrested for allegedly assisting in the attack.
SNT.149876.4849	In the video, the man, named Kamaluddin, claimed that he received his orders from the Haqqani network.
SNT.149876.4850	The latter is a militant organization based in Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area.
SNT.149876.4851	He calmly clarified that he had housed the seven attackers before the attack and had provided them with several weapons.
SNT.45742.4852	JetBlue Airways launched service from Raleigh-Durham International Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport on Thursday, July 20.

SNT.45742.4855	The route is flown by EMBRAER 190 aircraft with a capacity of 100 passengers.
SNT.45742.4856	The aircraft are equipped with DirecTV and XM Satellite Radio programming.
SNT.45742.4857	On October 18, JetBlue's service from Raleigh to Boston will begin with one daily flight.
SNT.45742.4858	Raleigh-Durham International Airport currently has 223 daily departures to 37 cities.
SNT.113129.4859	The 12-year-old son of neuroscientist and MIT graduate Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, Mohammad Ahmed, was handed over to his aunt Fauzia Siddiqui in Islamabad after years of detention in a US military base in Afghanistan.
SNT.113129.4860	Dr. Aafia Siddiqui is still currently facing trial charged with attempting to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.
SNT.113129.4861	Siddiqui and her three children disappeared after leaving her parent's house in Karachi on 30th March, 2003.
SNT.113129.4862	She was married to a nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the September 11 attacks.
SNT.113129.4863	Her husband was captured in 2003 and is now held at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center.
SNT.113129.4864	In 2004, Dr. Aafia was identified by the FBI as an "Al-Qaeda operative and facilitator who posed a clear and present danger to America".
SNT.113129.4865	Mohammad Ahmed was only six when he and his mother, brother and sister were abducted from Karachi in 2003 and later handed over to US authorities.
SNT.113129.4866	Dr. Fauzia told journalists after the boy had been given to her by officials of the interior ministry and intelligence agencies.
SNT.113129.4867	Mohammad Ahmed arrived at the Benazir International Airport in Islamabad from Kabul in a PIA flight and was taken to his aunt’s residence.
SNT.113129.4868	Human Rights Commission of Pakistan co-chairman Iqbal Haider said that the daughter of Dr. Aafia was also in Afghanistan.
SNT.113129.4869	He regretted that despite having U.S. nationality, the U.S. government did nothing for the release of its four citizens, stating that "this is [a] severe violation of the US laws and constitution."
SNT.113129.4870	Muhammad Ahmed landed back to his home in Karachi from where he had disappeared five years back, with his family. 
SNT.113129.4870-1	Dr. Fauzia and her family are hoping that the other two missing children would also be back home soon, by taking some positive steps from the Government of Pakistan.
SNT.33387.4871	The National Weather Service announced that some 27 inches of snow was measured at 4:10 p.m. EST at Central Park in New York City today, breaking a record set in 1947.
SNT.33387.4872	This after a day of snowfall and storms in the Northeastern United States.
SNT.33387.4873	The poor weather conditions prompted the shutdown of LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark International Airports.
SNT.33387.4874	Delta Airlines also canceled flights in and out of Washington, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Providence, and Hartford.
SNT.33387.4875	In Massachusetts, heavy snow and blizzard warnings were in effect as visibility had been greatly hindered by the falling snow.
SNT.33387.4876	There were other reports of near-blizzard conditions in parts of Connecticut, and Rhode Island.
SNT.33387.4877	Adding to the storm, wind gusts as high as 60 mph in New England prompted concerns over coastal flooding.
SNT.33387.4878	In New York City, Department of Transportation employees worked a twelve-hour overtime shift to salt and plow the snow from streets and highways.
SNT.33387.4879	Alternate-side of the street parking regulations are suspended, but not the city's public schools, much to the chagrin of New York's children.
SNT.33387.4880	Although the streets are navigable, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is a different story: Service between Jamaica and Penn Stations remains suspended, as is service along the Port Washington and Hempstead branches.
SNT.33387.4881	Additionally, all running branches are expected to be running with 30 minute delays.
SNT.33387.4882	The MTA Subways will cross-honor LIRR tickets, so customers will be able to take the E train from Jamaica instead.
SNT.21411.4883	Crude oil prices fell by $0.32, to $63.95 a barrel, after a report showed lower than expected losses in oil supplies due to Hurricane Katrina.
SNT.21411.4884	According to a report published by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), crude oil stocks declined by 6.5 million, to 315 million barrels.
SNT.21411.4885	The department also announced that 57% of the production capacity in the Gulf of Mexico is still down, versus 97% the day after the storm.
SNT.21411.4886	The DOE said it expected that production would not return to normal until December.
SNT.21411.4887	Yesterday, economists warned that one of the impacts of Katrina on the US economy would be a reduction in the number of jobs by up to 400,000.
SNT.21411.4888	They also said the country's GDP, in the second half of 2005, could be 1% less than expected, due to the surge in oil prices.
SNT.21411.4889	The Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Claude Mandil, announced a collective action by members of the 26 nation agency.
SNT.21411.4890	An agreement was reached to supply an additional 60 million barrels to the market over the next 30 days.
SNT.21411.4891	The biggest contribution of total response comes from North America (52%), then by Europe (30%), and finally the Pacific region (18%).
SNT.21411.4892	The share of these increases is based upon of the consumption from each of the IEA member areas.
SNT.42858.4893	In what might amount to one of the shocks of the tournament Trinidad and Tobago drew with Sweden 0-0 in the second Group B match, Saturday, despite having a defender sent off.
SNT.42858.4894	Lars Largerback's Swedish side failed to break a high-energy team marshalled with great confidence from midfield by the Trinidadian captain Dwight Yorke.
SNT.42858.4895	Some excellent defending from Carlos Edwards and the Caribbean back four managed to keep out its European rivals for a famous first ever point in the World Cup tournament for the small island country.
SNT.42858.4896	Trinidad and Tobago started the game with a reserve goalkeeper after first choice Kelvin Jack was injured after warming up.
SNT.42858.4897	But Shaka Hislop produced a string of outstanding saves, which included one 11 minutes from time when he stuck out a hand to stop Marcus Allback placing the ball over him.
SNT.42858.4898	The sending off of Avery John, after getting booked for a second time for a lunge, this time on Christian Wilhelmsson on 46 minutes, did not stop the Soca Warriors.
SNT.42858.4899	In reply Leo Benhakker changed to a more attacking 4-3-2 system and threw on an extra attacker.
SNT.42858.4900	The West Indies team led by Yorke was competitive and hard in the tackle but Swedish pressure meant the team was in its own half of the pitch most of the game.
SNT.42858.4901	The team had few chances on goal because its attacking plays were few; but one shot from substitute Cornell Glen clipped the crossbar to the glee of supporters.
SNT.42858.4902	Sweden made many goalscoring chances but its strikers must feel unfortunate that none were converted.
SNT.42858.4903	Rami Shaaban in the Sweden goal did not have a save to make.
SNT.42858.4904	A statistic that says much for the dominance of the Swedish yellow jerseys is that Sweden had eight corner kicks to Trinidad and Tobago's one.
SNT.24454.4905	The Norwegian government has in recent days taken several steps to prevent a possible bird flu epidemic from entering the country and further spreading within the nations border.
SNT.24454.4906	The authority also asked the border customs to increase the inspections against possible illegal import of poultry.
SNT.24454.4907	Import of poultry has also been stopped from parts of Russia and other countries.
SNT.130065.4908	Two Palestinian families who have been living in East Jerusalem since 1956, were evicted from their homes on Sunday after an Israeli court rejected their appeal filed against the eviction.
SNT.130065.4909	The eviction comes after increasing international pressure on Israel to stop settlement activity and end home evictions.
SNT.130065.4910	Israeli security forces entered the homes at 6:00 a.m. (local time) and forcibly removed the family and international activists who were also living in the homes.
SNT.130065.4911	Al Jazeera reports that a family was beaten with batons as they tried to get back into their house.
SNT.130065.4912	JTA reports that Jewish families moved into the homes shortly after the Palestinian families were evicted.
SNT.130065.4913	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has laid biblical claim to the areas of East Jerusalem and has stated that Jews have the right to live anywhere in the city.
SNT.130065.4914	Although Jerusalem is internationally recognized as occupied territory, Israel continues to evict Palestinians and instead build Jewish only apartments in the area, an action which is considered to be illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
SNT.130065.4915	Israel has plans for 350 new apartment buildings in East Jerusalem.
SNT.130065.4916	U.N special coordinator for Middle East Peace, Robert Serry, condemned the evictions as "totally unacceptable".

SNT.77560.4918	A police station of the Spanish Guardia Civil was attacked today Friday by a car bomb in the Basque city of Durango, injuring two policemen.
SNT.77560.4919	It is believed to be the first serious attack of the separatist group ETA since it unilaterally ended a cease-fire in June.
SNT.77560.4920	The blast caused serious damage to the police barracks in Durango, shattering windows and damaging police cars parked outside.
SNT.77560.4921	Police sources believe the bomb, estimated to contain between 80 and 100 kilograms of explosives, was detonated remotely by one of the two attackers who fled in another vehicle.
SNT.77560.4922	Another car exploded about one hour later in the town of Amorebieta, possibly the one used by the activists to flee.
SNT.77560.4923	ETA detonated two small explosive devices on July 25 along the route that the Tour of France used when the race dipped into northern Spain for a few hours.
SNT.77560.4924	ETA called the cease-fire in March 2006, but grew frustrated with a lack of government concessions in ensuing peace talks, and set off a huge bomb in a parking area at Madrid's airport on December 30, killing two people.
SNT.77560.4925	It insisted then that the truce was still in effect, but finally declared it formally over in June, and Spanish security forces have been on alert ever since.
SNT.3036.4926	As of January 9th, the agency's website is in compliance with the Brazilian government's program to use free software throughout the public sector.
SNT.3036.4927	Free software is software which, once obtained, can be used, copied, studied, modified and redistributed.
SNT.3036.4928	It is often made available online without charge or offline for the cost of distribution; free software is not limited to being given away, but can be "free as in free speech" and sold for profit.
SNT.3036.4929	Some of the most well-known examples of free software are the Linux operating system, the Mozilla web browser and the OpenOffice office suite.
SNT.3036.4930	The change has taken about a year and a half, since the first changes of some workstations and servers of Radiobrás.
SNT.3036.4931	The switch to free software is being implemented by the National Institute of Technology of Information (ITI), inspired by similar decisions made in another countries.
SNT.37267.4932	At 13.30 GMT, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake 800 km south of Tokyo according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.
SNT.37267.4933	The quake affected Oita, Kochi and Miyazaki prefectures without any reports of injuries or severe damage.
SNT.37267.4934	The epicenter was reported below the Pacific Ocean floor, however; no tsunami alert was issued.
SNT.37267.4935	A previous earthquake in October of 2004 killed at least 40 people and injured 3,000 when a magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook the region of Niigata in northern Japan and in 1995 a magnitude 7.3 earthquake shook Kobe, Japan and killed at least 6,400 people.
SNT.41490.4936	The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled that Honolulu's ban on aerial advertising is constitutional and rejected the arguments of a pro-life/anti-abortion group that contended that the ban restricts free speech.
SNT.41490.4937	In a unanimous ruling, the court ruled that the city's ban on aerial advertising is not pre-empted by federal law and violates neither the free speech provisions of the First Amendment nor the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
SNT.41490.4938	The Center for Bioethical Reform (CBR) challenged Honolulu's ban, claiming that the ban infringes on their right to public advocacy.
SNT.41490.4939	The group planned to fly a plane towing a 100-foot banner showing graphic images of aborted fetuses, and contended that authorization they sought and received from the Federal Aviation Administration authorized the group to fly in all fifty states and Puerto Rico.
SNT.41490.4940	The CBR has driven vans with such images around Honolulu in the past few years.
SNT.41490.4941	Judge David Ezra, U.S. District Judge for Hawaii, ruled in November 2004 that the ordinance was constitutional.
SNT.41490.4942	The appeal was argued before the 9th Circuit in Honolulu in November 2005.
SNT.41490.4943	Announcing their intent to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Gregg Cunningham, executive director of the CBR, said, "We never expected to get justice in the U.S. District Courts or in Honolulu."
SNT.41490.4944	"Our goal has always been to get to the U.S. Supreme Court."
SNT.41490.4945	"It's the only place we feel we'll get a fair hearing."
SNT.41490.4946	"If the environmental groups and political leftists who are trying to suppress the truth about abortion think we're going to go away because we lost two cases that we fully expected to lose, they're in for a rude awakening," Cunningham said.
SNT.41490.4947	Hawaii has had a statewide prohibition on billboards and similar forms of advertising since 1927, and is unique among U.S. states in this regard.
SNT.41490.4948	In addition, since 1957, Honolulu has had a comprehensive law regulating the size and content of signs.
SNT.41490.4949	Honolulu's ban on all aerial advertising was enacted in 1978.
SNT.41490.4950	Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann praised the decision, saying, "This obviously has strong implications for our visitor industry to know that when people come here they're going to see things here that really make for an island paradise type of vacation."
SNT.41490.4951	Mary Steiner, head of the Outdoor Circle, an environmental group that supports the ban, said, "We have never doubted for a moment the importance of the scenic environment that it is just as important as any of the rest of the environmental issues that are out there."
SNT.41490.4952	"We're not going to stand by and let it be destroyed in any way, shape or form."
SNT.6922.4953	Elections in Zimbabwe began with both the ruling and opposition parties predicting victory.
SNT.6922.4954	Current president Robert Mugabe predicts a "mountainous victory" for his party, the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF).
SNT.6922.4955	The main opposition — Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) claims the election is being rigged, and despite being allowed to freely campaign, the government's intimidation of voters and moves to hurt opposition supporters will prevent the MDC win.
SNT.6922.4956	The government recently withheld food aid from those supporting the MDC, according to a United Nations report.
SNT.6922.4957	The UN further reports the government dismissed election officials and poll workers suspected of supporting MDC.
SNT.6922.4958	Last week, a Catholic archbishop in Zimbabwe urged followers to start a non-violent, popular uprising against Mugabe, and rallies have been common in recent days.
SNT.6922.4959	The previous elections, which the MDC almost won, were marred by violence and similar allegations of vote-rigging.
SNT.6922.4960	More than 5.7 million Zimbabweans are registered to vote, and can cast their ballots at one of the more than 8,000 polling stations.
SNT.254930.4961	At least fourteen people have died after eating toxic sardines in Madagascar.
SNT.254930.4962	The deaths occurred in the town of Toliara, with another similar situation happening 130 km (80.8 mi) away in Sakaraha.
SNT.254930.4963	The sardines the victims ate belong to the Clupeidae family.
SNT.254930.4964	As well as the dead, around 120 people have been taken ill after eating the fish according to officials.

SNT.254930.4966	He added in his statement that the government would pay for the medical bills for those who are still hospitalized from the toxic fish and would also supply 100 mattresses to the city of Toliara, as the region's hospital is overcrowded.
SNT.254930.4967	Samples of the sardines have been sent to health officials at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar in the capital city of Antananarivo.
SNT.254930.4968	Incidents like this have happened before in which researchers have tracked the cause down to the fish eating poisonous seaweed.
SNT.254930.4969	Madagascar has the third biggest coral system in the world.
SNT.101050.4970	The website wikileaks.org has recently been brought back online following the lifting of a court injunction forcing the site to be taken down.
SNT.101050.4971	As Wikleaks is a wiki and is therefore not run by anyone, Jonathon Winterview interviewed a spokesperson of Wikileaks, who answered all the below questions.
SNT.79525.4972	Officials with the United States Department of Defense have stated that Israeli fighter planes struck at least one target inside Syria a week ago.
SNT.79525.4973	On September 7, Syrian fighter planes fired upon Israeli jets that were allegedly "dropping ammunition" in the northeastern part of Syria.
SNT.79525.4974	The actual target, or the extent of the damage has yet to be determined, but U.S. officials say a weapons storage facility was the likely target.
SNT.79525.4975	The Israeli government believes that Iran is sending weapons through Syria to Lebanon to arm the militant group Hezbollah.
SNT.79525.4976	Israel also thinks that those weapons are coming from North Korea.
SNT.79525.4977	"They were engaged by the Syrians, they dropped their ordinance and scooted out of there."
SNT.79525.4978	"The Israelis think North Korea is selling to Iran and Syria what little they have left," said an unnamed Defense Department official who also said that Israeli planes are taking photographs of possible targets and nuclear power facilities inside Syria.
SNT.79525.4979	Syrian officials believe that the ammunition was dropped in order to make the Israeli planes go faster so that they may escape.
SNT.79525.4980	"They were fleeing and in order to speed up the planes they dropped the munitions."
SNT.79525.4981	"We are exerting efforts so that we don't fall into this trap," said Bashar Jaafari, Syria's Ambassador to the United Nations.
SNT.79525.4982	Israel has not confirmed or denied the reports, simply stating "we cannot discuss military operations."
SNT.230242.4983	Over 100 homes were damaged and at least 30 of them were destroyed.
SNT.230242.4984	The explosion had an estimated blast radius of three miles.
SNT.230242.4985	Describing exploding gas tanks that flew through the air, Carlos Hipolito, who fled the scene with approximately 60 relatives, described the incident to Milenio Television as a "catastrophe".
SNT.230242.4986	Living ten blocks from where the explosion occurred, 58-year-old Jose Luis Chavez explained that he had heard a minimum of two loud explosions and witnessed flames rising over 10 meters (30 feet) into the air.
SNT.230242.4987	Valentin Meneses, Puebla state interior secretary, stated: "They lost control because of the high pressure with which the fuel exits the pipeline."
SNT.230242.4988	Pemex has explained that the theft of oil from the pipelines causes them to lose hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
SNT.230242.4989	Juan José Suárez Coppel, the head of the company, stated that the pipeline section near to the location of the blast was tapped illegally on 60 occasions.
SNT.230242.4990	He also reported that across Mexico, 550 cases of illegal tapping had occurred.
SNT.230242.4991	Expressing his condolences to the families of those that had died because of this incident, Mexican president Felipe Calderon stated that the federal government is to launch an investigation to try to establish the identities of the offenders and apprehend them.
SNT.56537.4992	The bodies of five women within the United Kingdom have been found in or around the county of Suffolk in the east of England.
SNT.56537.4993	The latest victims were found on 12 December 2006 in a rural area a few hundred meters apart, and one body discovered within 40 minutes of the other.
SNT.56537.4994	Detectives investigating the murders have confirmed that the last body discovered was that of 29 year old Annette Nicholls.
SNT.56537.4995	Five women have been found dead within 10 days and authorities face an "unprecedented" murder investigation.
SNT.28727.4996	A group of Melbourne scientists has released a study of the energy problems confronting Australia in the future.
SNT.28727.4997	The study endorses the use of nuclear energy and attacks some of the data used by anti-nuclear campaigners.
SNT.28727.4998	The scientists from the University of Melbourne say their research shows that the benefits of nuclear energy have been underestimated and concerns about nuclear waste overplayed.
SNT.28727.4999	The six month study compared the environmental impact, health risks, economic effects and social implications of the use of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy, and nuclear power.
SNT.28727.5000	According to the Melbourne University, the investigation will significantly impact the nuclear debate in Australia, with findings showing that hundreds of times more uranium could be available than was predicted in a widely quoted European study.
SNT.28727.5001	Associate Professor Martin Sevior, of Melbourne University's school of physics, claims the recent study bolsters the case for Australia to invest more in nuclear energy.
SNT.28727.5002	Sevior says his research into nuclear waste disposal should help dispel many environmentalists' fears.
SNT.28727.5003	"One thing that's perhaps not always realised is that the amount of waste that comes out of a typical plant is around 30 tonnes a year," he said.
SNT.28727.5004	"The amount of waste that comes out of a coal-fired power plant is around 1,000 tonnes a day."
SNT.28727.5005	Prof Sevior says his study has exposed flaws in the European study into the limits of the uranium industry.
SNT.28727.5006	"This previous research overestimated the energy costs and carbon emissions generated by the construction of nuclear power plants and for mining uranium," Prof Sevior said.
SNT.28727.5007	The Australian Conservation Foundation's (ACF) nuclear campaigner, Dave Sweeney, says the study appears flawed and does not provide a sound argument for the use of nuclear energy.
SNT.28727.5008	"It glances over some really key concerns of proliferation, key areas of reactor safety are not delved into too deeply and they have direct links to industry websites for further information," said Mr Sweeney.
SNT.28727.5009	"I'm not sure it's altogether appropriate or altogether balanced to be referring people to the nuclear industry's own websites for further information on such matters as radioactive waste, nuclear weapons and nuclear reactor safety."
SNT.28727.5010	The six-month study found Australia has more uranium than was previously thought.
SNT.28727.5011	"We have enough uranium in Australia to power the country for thousands of years," said Prof Sevior.
SNT.28727.5012	Friends of the Earth nuclear campaigner Dr Jim Green said nuclear power should never be considered as an energy source.
SNT.28727.5013	He said greenhouse emissions saved by switching to nuclear power were only about 5 per cent of total emissions and could only be achieved if thousands of reactors were installed globally.
SNT.28727.5014	Dr Green said an energy debate in Australia was necessary, but it had to go beyond just the nuclear alternative.
SNT.998779.5015	Polling was active from 8:00AM to 5:00PM local time (0300 to 1200 UTC).
SNT.998779.5016	High security arrangements were made; law enforcement officials were deployed at the polling stations.
SNT.998779.5017	According to media reports, in some areas of province women were stopped from casting their vote.
SNT.998779.5018	Missing elections material delayed the beginning of voting in some regions.
SNT.998779.5019	33,000 polling staff had been appointed to over 5000 polling stations.
SNT.998779.5020	According to Pakistani newspaper Dawn, sources in the provincial home department said overall voting turnout was 70% in Mastung, 65% in Nushki, 55% in Pishin, 50% in Jhal Magsi, 45% in Nasirabad, Kohlu and 35% in Barkhan.
SNT.998779.5021	For example, turnout remained 15% in Gwadar and 10% in Panjgur.
SNT.998779.5022	Unofficial election results for district council of Quetta District, containing the capital of Balochistan, are as follows:
SNT.4994.5023	The leu, Romania's national currency, continues to appreciate against the euro and the US dollar after it reached high levels a few days ago.
SNT.4994.5024	Yesterday, one euro could be bought for just 35,844 lei, down from 36,133 lei two days ago.
SNT.4994.5025	These rates are also significantly stronger from the period in mid-2004 when the euro was worth more than 40,000 lei.
SNT.4994.5026	Last week, the leu reached such a high rate against the euro that the National Bank of Romania had to intervene and restore the exchange rate back to around 37,000 lei per euro.
SNT.4994.5027	The leu's growth also had an impact on global exchange rates, weakening the US dollar worldwide by 1%.
SNT.4994.5028	The National Bank, however, is hesitant to intervene in the marketplace once again due to the positive effects of the leu's appreciation on importers, who can now get products for lower prices, and for consumers, who now have higher purchasing power for imported goods.
SNT.4994.5029	Romanians are also pleased that their currency, which has faced long periods of fairly sharp depreciation in the 1990s due to high inflation, is finally picking up again and strengthening against other currencies.
SNT.4994.5030	The leu's appreciation, however, isn't all positive, because it is putting a great deal of pressure on exporters.
SNT.4994.5031	Other countries are finding Romanian exports more expensive, and therefore less competitive, due to the leu's appreciation, and this could widen the already large account deficit in the country.
SNT.4994.5032	Analysts predict, however, that the leu's surge cannot be stopped and it will continue strengthening against the euro, reaching a rate of 34,000 lei for one euro in the next week.
SNT.4994.5033	The current leu will be replaced in July 2005 with the New Leu (RON), with 10,000 old lei = 1 New Leu.
SNT.4994.5034	The revaluation is expected to prepare Romania for adoption of the euro in 2012.
SNT.4994.5035	Starting from next month, all Romanian prices must be shown in both the old currency and the new currency.
SNT.4994.5036	The National Bank of Romania has said that it expects the exchange rate between the New Leu and the euro to hover at around 3.5 RON = 1 euro when the RON is introduced.
SNT.73275.5037	A young woman was killed Friday night after an accident occurred on a gyrating ride at the Playland amusement park in Rye, New York in the United States.
SNT.73275.5038	The woman, Gabriela Garin, was a worker at the amusement park, and had worked there for the past seven years.
SNT.73275.5039	The accident occurred near the end of Garin's shift; as she was loading riders onto the ride.
SNT.73275.5040	The ride's new operator, unaware of Garin's presence, started the ride while Garin was still on it.
SNT.73275.5041	The new operator then noticed Garin, and shut the ride down in 20 seconds, but Garin had already been ejected from the ride and killed, according to a park spokesperson.
SNT.73275.5042	The ride is an attraction that spins people around in two-seat cars, inside a darkened tent to flashing lights and music.
SNT.73275.5043	This incident is not the first in the ride's history.
SNT.73275.5044	In 2004, a seven-year-old from Connecticut managed to free herself from the ride's restraining bars, and climb onto the front edge of her seat.
SNT.73275.5045	A safety precaution was put in place after this incident, however, the spokesperson acknowledged that it was not followed when Garin was killed.
SNT.73275.5046	The company which owns the ride shut it down, along with two other rides it owns at the park.
SNT.73275.5047	The park features more than 50 rides, a pool, and a beach.
SNT.104305.5048	A bus accident near the Spanish coastal resort town of Benalmádena has killed nine passengers and injured 35, all of whom were Finnish, police said Saturday night.
SNT.104305.5049	The bus collided with a sport utility vehicle on a highway along the Spanish coast, causing the bus to veer off the road and overturn.
SNT.104305.5050	The driver of the SUV had survived, and is being detained on suspicion of drink driving, Spanish newspaper Sur claiming a breathalyser test revealed twice the legal blood alcohol limit.
SNT.104305.5051	Police say the SUV driver was attempting to illegally pass another vehicle.
SNT.104305.5052	"There were 44 people on the bus, and it seems they were all Finnish," said a spokesman for the Civil Guard.
SNT.104305.5053	He also reported that six of the injured were in serious condition.
SNT.104305.5054	A police spokeswoman added that the death toll could rise as rescue workers continue to search for victims.
SNT.104305.5055	The tourists were being driven to Málaga Airport on a return trip to Finland when the crash occurred between Benalmadena and Torremolinos.
SNT.104305.5056	The eastbound lanes of the AP-7 highway where the collision occurred have been closed, Spanish media reported.
SNT.104305.5057	A field hospital was set up at the site of the accident, which provided emergency first aid to the victims.
SNT.104305.5058	The injured tourists were then taken to five different hospitals in the Costa del Sol region.
SNT.104305.5059	The 11 tourists who emerged from the accident unscathed were taken to a hotel.
SNT.104305.5060	The bus accident is Spain's worst in more than seven years.
SNT.46746.5061	Oil prices rose dramatically on Monday after a major Alaskan oil field shut down operations, halving the total output of oil from Alaska.
SNT.46746.5062	Coming on top of the ongoing violence in the Middle East, the price of Light, sweet crude for September delivery rose by $1.23 to US$75.99 a barrel in early afternoon Asian trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
SNT.46746.5063	The shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay oil field "caught traders by surprise", says Victor Shum, an energy analyst in Singapore.
SNT.46746.5064	"The Middle East violence is a threat to the oil supply, but Alaska is a real disruption."
SNT.46746.5065	The oil field began shutdown procedures on Sunday due to severe corrosion and a minor leakage from an oil transit line.
SNT.46746.5066	The total shutdown process is expected to take a few more days.
SNT.46746.5067	BP Exploration Alaska, Inc, the company running the field, has said that oil production will be reduced by 400,000 barrels per day, or nearly 8% of the total U.S. oil production.
SNT.46746.5068	BP officials do not know how long the field will stay offline.
SNT.4109.5069	A collaboratively-developed operating system kernel known as GNU Hurd has been made bootable using the L4 microkernel, which provides room for significant speed improvements over an existing implementation using the Mach microkernel.
SNT.4109.5070	The newer architecture also has a more lively developer community.
SNT.4109.5071	Developer Marcus Brinkmann made the historic step and finished the process initialization code, which enabled him to execute the first software on Hurd-L4.
SNT.4109.5072	In a message to the L4 port of GNU Hurd mailing list, Brinkmann wrote, "We can now easily explore and develop the system in any way we want."
SNT.4109.5073	"With my glibc port, I can already build simple applications, but most won't run because they need a filesystem or other gimmicks (like, uhm, fork and exec), and I only have stubs (dummy functions which always return an error) for that now," he added in a later posting.
SNT.4109.5074	Compared with Linux and BSD Unix's monolithic kernel architecture, a microkernel based operating system provides developers greater modularity and isolation from hardware, a big win with L4 already being available for a large number of hardware varieties.
SNT.4109.5075	There is a cost in speed for such abstraction, and this cost was higher on Mach, at around 15%, compared with only around 5% on L4 and it's predecessor L3, both developed by Dr. Jochen Liedtke.
SNT.4109.5076	The greater modularity and abstraction of a microkernel approach means that the microkernel itself does not need constant modification as is seen in the Linux kernel today, since it provides only the very minimum of services, and does so very carefully.
SNT.4109.5077	However, the Mach kernel first developed ten years earlier at Carnegie Mellon University is seen as a flawed first implementation, with the lessons learned being implemented in microkernels like L4, known as second-generation microkernels.
SNT.4109.5078	The GNU Hurd forms the base of the GNU operating system, much of which has been widely adopted by users of other Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.
SNT.4109.5079	The GNU Project has been developing the Hurd since 1983.
SNT.4109.5080	In 1990, the GNU Project decided to use the Mach kernel, rather than writing their own.
SNT.4109.5081	The Hurd is released as free software under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
SNT.4109.5082	The Hurd kernel is an experiment which aims to surpass existing Unix kernels in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with them.
SNT.4109.5083	According to the GNU Hurd project, "The Hurd should, and probably will, be ported to other hardware architectures or other microkernels in the future" .
SNT.4109.5084	A limited port of Linux already runs on L4, known as L4Linux.
SNT.16621.5085	On Sunday, a group of 80 people from Beijing and Shanghai landed at Heathrow to become the first Chinese to arrive in the United Kingdom on tourist visas.
SNT.16621.5086	After protracted negotiations last year, the UK was granted "Approved Destination Status" (ADS) by the People's Republic of China in January 2005.
SNT.16621.5087	The agreement will also allow travel companies to establish offices in China to promote tourism to the UK.
SNT.16621.5088	Before the signing of the agreement, China allowed only students and people on business trips to visit the country.
SNT.16621.5089	It is estimated that 135,000 people visited the UK last year — just 0.6% of China's external tourism market.
SNT.16621.5090	The 80 tourists are expected to visit London, Oxfordshire, Stratford-upon-Avon and Scotland, where they will meet the First Minister, Jack McConnell, in Edinburgh Castle.
SNT.16621.5091	The Duke of York is expected to greet the tourists at the Tower of London later today.
SNT.16621.5092	Other destinations will include Liverpool (twinned with Shanghai) and Manchester's Old Trafford stadium, where the football team Manchester United play.
SNT.16621.5093	They have a large following in China and are currently on a Far East tour.
SNT.16621.5094	They are to play Beijing Hyundai in a friendly match tomorrow.
SNT.16621.5095	The visit comes after the London attacks earlier this month provoked fears by the British tourist industry of a reduction in tourism to the UK.
SNT.16621.5096	The UK tourist industry hopes that by 2020, Chinese tourism to the UK will bring £500 million pounds (about $878 million US dollars) annually to the UK economy.
SNT.36511.5097	After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief.
SNT.36511.5098	Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments.
SNT.36511.5099	In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die.
SNT.36511.5100	Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need.
SNT.36511.5101	For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 tsunami generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now 75% underfunded.
SNT.36511.5102	The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters.
SNT.36511.5103	"We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive." 
SNT.36511.5104	"The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters", said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on March 9.
SNT.36511.5105	Jan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund.
SNT.36511.5106	"We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much, "he said.
SNT.36511.5107	"Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need." 
SNT.36511.5108	"We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."
SNT.36511.5109	The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway.
SNT.36511.5110	The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands.
SNT.65928.5111	According to the USGS numerous earthquakes ranging from magnitudes 5.1 to 6.1 have been reported off the western coast of Japan, prompting tsunami warnings to be issued.
SNT.65928.5112	The first quake, a 6.0 magnitude, was reported at 9:26 a.m. local time (00:26 UTC), 165 km (105 miles) north, north east of Ishigaki-jima, in the Ryukyu Islands in Japan.
SNT.65928.5113	The second quake of 5.6 magnitude struck just five minutes after the first and a 6.1 magnitude quake struck just over an hour later, followed by a magnitude 5.9 about 15 minutes later.
SNT.65928.5114	Japan's weather agency says the first and last quakes were actually 6.7 magnitude.
SNT.65928.5115	Three smaller quakes ranging from 5.1 to 5.3 magnitudes shortly followed.
SNT.65928.5116	The tsunami warnings were issued only after Japan's weather agency said that an 18-inch (46cm) wave could be a possibility.
SNT.65928.5117	There are no reports of damage, injuries, deaths or tsunamis.
SNT.48316.5118	Residents in the city of Port Harcourt said that Nigerian troops burnt down hundreds of slum dwellings, allegedly as reprisal after an Army sergeant was killed in Thursday's abduction of oil workers in the area.
SNT.48316.5119	Residents told news agencies that troops poured petrol over slum houses located near a compound belonging to Saipem, a subsidiary of Italian oil company Eni, and set them alight.
SNT.48316.5120	The fires have reportedly destroyed hundreds of homes and shops and hundreds of people are said to have fled from the area.
SNT.48316.5121	On Friday, people returning to the area and onlookers were chased away by soldiers.
SNT.48316.5122	Speaking to the Associated Press, Army Brigadier General Samuel Salihu denied that Nigerian troops were responsible for the arson.
SNT.48316.5123	He said that militants active in the area had set the fires, wearing Army camouflage.
SNT.48316.5124	On Thursday, oil workers were kidnapped from a bar near the slums by armed men who shot dead an Army soldier guarding the workers, and injured another soldier.
SNT.48316.5125	Nigerian military sources said at least two foreign oil workers were missing, one of them, Italian.
SNT.48316.5126	The Italian foreign ministry, though, said that three foreigners were missing.
SNT.48316.5127	The oil-rich Niger Delta region has witnessed a spate of kidnappings recently.
SNT.48316.5128	Nineteen people were held captive in eight separate abductions this month.
SNT.48316.5129	All but three of them have been released since, some after the state government and the oil companies paid a ransom.
SNT.48316.5130	The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a militant group which has taken hostages and attacked oil facilities, but says it does not kidnap for ransom, said in a statement that the state government has encouraged such abductions by paying ransoms.
SNT.48316.5131	Last week, as part of a tougher line adopted by the Nigerian government, President Obasanjo sent in the Army, with orders to use "force for force" against militants in the region.
SNT.48316.5132	Over 160 people were taken into custody in a two day crackdown, including over 100 from a nearby slum, but most have been released since then.
SNT.48316.5133	The BBC's Alex Last reports that local leaders and oil companies are concerned that this new tough policy will increase tensions in the region.
SNT.54821.5134	Currently, there are blackouts, heavy rain, and high winds in British Columbia.
SNT.54821.5135	Buildings have already collapsed and trees have been knocked down.
SNT.54821.5136	Five Vancouver rivers were in danger of flooding, which rain fell at 10 mm an hour for more than six hours at midday.
SNT.54821.5137	The steel frame of a four-storey building under construction in Vancouver collapsed.
SNT.54821.5138	Construction workers escaped injury, luckily they were on a coffee break at the time of the incident.
SNT.54821.5139	The steel frame crushed cars in a parking lot and missed a truck driver.
SNT.54821.5140	"We have some real fears here with electrical problems," said Captain Rob Jones Cook of the Vancouver Fire Department.
SNT.54821.5141	"We also have hydro bus lines running down two sides of the building".
SNT.54821.5142	The Vancouver Fire Department says they have no idea as to why the building collapsed.
SNT.54821.5143	Winds are gusting at more than 100 kilometres an hour (62 mph) in some areas and rainfall amounts of 50 to 130 millimetres.
SNT.54821.5144	According BC Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Moreno, the hardest-hit areas are Vancouver, Surrey, Langley, Abbotsford and Mission, B.C.
SNT.54821.5145	"We're trying to be optimistic and hoping it's by end of day today, but there may very well be customers that are into the early-morning hours before restoration," Moreno said.
SNT.54821.5146	Extensive ferry cancellations, road closures, and massive power outages are in effect until the storm ends.
SNT.54821.5147	The RCMP have advised people to stay home and off the highway.
SNT.54821.5148	The same heavy weather has also affected nearby Washington State, USA.
SNT.553300.5149	Radonski promised a shift towards more of a business-friendly stance: "Those who want progress, jobs, well-managed companies, somewhere we can develop small and medium businesses…everyone who wants that kind of country, come and join my bus for progress".

SNT.123039.5152	In an appearance on the The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday night, United States President Barack Obama told host, Jay Leno, that he had bowled at the White House bowling alley and scored a 129.
SNT.123039.5153	It was like the Special Olympics or something, the President said.

SNT.123039.5157	He phoned Timothy Shriver from Air Force One on the way back to Washington, D.C..
SNT.123039.5158	Tim Shriver is also the son of Eunice Kennedy Shriver who founded the Special Olympics.
SNT.123039.5159	"He expressed his disappointment, and he apologized in a way that was very moving. " 
SNT.123039.5159-1	"He expressed that he did not intend to humiliate this population," Shriver said on Friday in an interview on Good Morning America.
SNT.123039.5161	"People with special needs are great athletes and productive citizens."
SNT.123039.5162	"The President made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics," White House deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, said.
SNT.123039.5163	"He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world."
SNT.123039.5164	Meanwhile, Kolan McConiughey, a top Special Olympics bowler told the Associated Press that he doesn't think Obama bowls like a Special Olympian.
SNT.123039.5165	McConiughey has five perfect 300 games on his track record as a bowler and averages a score of 212.
SNT.123039.5166	"I'd tell him to get a new bowling ball, new shoes and bring him down to the lane," said McConiughey, offering bowling advice to the President.
SNT.123039.5167	"Keep his body straight, his arm straight and keep his steps straight". 
SNT.123039.5168	Maria Shriver, sister of Tim Shriver, said "The President's comment hurts millions of people throughout the world."
SNT.123039.5169	California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is married to Maria Shriver, said, "He [Obama] loves Special Olympics, and he would do everything he can to help Special Olympics."
SNT.123039.5170	Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters, "I know that the President believes that the Special Olympics are a triumph of the human spirit, and I think he understands that they deserve a lot better than — than the thoughtless joke that he made last night".
SNT.139103.5171	The Director of public prosecutions in England and Wales are going to seek a retrial for three men who are thought to have been involved in a plot to attempt to bomb transatlantic flights.
SNT.139103.5172	Ibrahim Savant and Arafat Khan are both 28 years old.
SNT.139103.5173	All of the men were recently found "not guilty" of attempting to bomb aircrafts.
SNT.139103.5174	A spokesman for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, confirmed that he will be seeking a retrial.
SNT.139103.5175	On Monday, a jury in Woolwich Crown Court in London, England failed to reach verdicts for the three men, based on charges of conspiracy to murder, which is why the Director of Public Prosecutions of England and Wales is seeking a retrial.
SNT.139103.5176	Starmer said: "My task is to judge whether, taking into account all relevant considerations, the public interest is better served in this particular case by offering no evidence or by seeking a further retrial."
SNT.139103.5177	"Having regard to the very serious nature of the charge and the very considerable public interest in having the allegation determined by a jury one way or the other, I have concluded that, in this exceptional case, it is in the public interest to seek a further retrial."
SNT.441735.5178	Abdelbaset al-Megrahi has been buried in the town of Janzur, west of the Libyan capital Tripoli.
SNT.441735.5179	He was the only individual convicted in association with the Lockerbie bombing of 1988.
SNT.441735.5180	The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York resulted in 270 fatalities, including all 259 of the airplane's occupants and eleven individuals on the ground.
SNT.441735.5181	189 of those who died in the incident were US citizens.
SNT.441735.5182	The death toll for this terrorist incident is larger than that for any other which has occurred in the United Kingdom thus far.
SNT.441735.5183	Five years later, senior judges in Scotland were to review his case, but he dropped the appeal.
SNT.441735.5184	Due to suffering from prostate cancer, he was granted a compassionate release from Scottish prison two days later.
SNT.441735.5185	Current UK Prime Minister David Cameron commented on his belief that al-Megrahi "should never have been released from prison" and said his death was an occasion "to remember the 270 people who lost their lives in what was an appalling terrorist act".
SNT.441735.5186	According to Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland, the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing is ongoing.
SNT.441735.5187	Prosecutors, he said, had always thought there were others besides al-Megrahi involved in the attack.
SNT.441735.5188	US citizen Susan Cohen, the mother of one of those killed in the Lockerbie bombing, thought of al-Megrahi as "a mass murderer" who "deserved to die", adding to CNN: "I feel no pity around him".　
SNT.441735.5189	"My daughter [Theodora], at age 20, died a brutal, horrible death."
SNT.441735.5190	However, UK citizen Jim Swire, father of another victim of the bombing, believes al-Megrahi was not guilty.
SNT.441735.5191	He described al-Megrahi's death as "a sad time", telling the BBC he was "satisfied for some years that this man was nothing to do with the murder of my daughter".

SNT.80949.5193	Recent media coverage of the murder of Brett Kebble have raised questions of the close friendship between Jackie Selebi and Glenn Agliotti.
SNT.80949.5194	Agliotti was later arrested in connection with the murder of Brett Kebble.
SNT.80949.5195	Agliotti is alleged to have strong links with organized crime and racketeering.
SNT.53694.5196	New Delhi is experiencing the second day of a strike by traders protesting against the implementation of a Supreme Court order to seal commercial establishments violating zoning rules by operating in residential zones.
SNT.53694.5197	The strike has affected a very large area in New Delhi including major markets in Rohini, Chandani Chowk, Karol Bagh and south extension of Delhi.

SNT.53694.5201	Traders refused to move back from the agitation until November 1, when Municipal Corporation of Delhi is likely to resume its sealing drive.
SNT.53694.5202	According to official sources, the union government is likely to file a review petition before the Supreme Court to temporarily suspend the drive and resolve this dispute as soon as possible.
SNT.53694.5203	After seeing the law-and-order situation in Delhi, the Supreme Court's Monitoring committee recommended the Supreme Court not to resume the MCD's sealing drive on November 1.

SNT.745184.5219	Two rockets hit the south of Lebanon's capital Beirut today, injuring three or more people.
SNT.745184.5220	The rockets landed in a district controlled by the Hezbollah organisation, a Shi'a Islamic militant and political group, with one rocket hitting a car showroom, and the other a residential building.
SNT.745184.5221	While it is unclear who fired the rockets, Lebanon's interior minister, Marwan Charbel, said it appeared the rockets had come from the south-east of the city.
SNT.745184.5222	The attacks come after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah addressed his followers yesterday, committing the militant group to fighting in Syria's conflict.
SNT.745184.5223	Syrian rebels have threatened retaliation against the Hezbollah group for sending fighters to assist Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is fighting to end a revolt against his rule.
SNT.745184.5224	The revolt started more than two years ago, and has killed 80,000 people, leaving 1.5 million refugees.

SNT.745184.5227	In the Syrian border town of Qusayr, government and Hezbollah forces continue a seven-day battle to expel Syrian rebels from the town.
SNT.745184.5228	Reportedly 40 or more people were killed there yesterday, including a number of Hezbollah fighters.
SNT.745184.5229	Nasrallah pledged Hezbollah will continue fighting until the conflict has been turned in President Assad's favour.
SNT.106081.5230	Over 40 children have died in an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in China, and the country's capital of Beijing reported its first death due to the disease on Wednesday.
SNT.106081.5231	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing Health Bureau spokeswoman Deng Xiaohong said that the 13-month-old boy died Sunday while en route to the hospital.
SNT.106081.5232	Health authorities state that 24,934 children in mainland China are afflicted with the disease, and 42 children have died from it.
SNT.106081.5233	The cause of the disease has been identified as Enterovirus 71 (EV-71).
SNT.106081.5234	Another child infected with the virus died Monday, but as he died in Hebei province his death was counted there.
SNT.106081.5235	Xinhua News Agency also reported that a 21-month-old boy died Monday of the virus in Hubei province.
SNT.106081.5236	After an order was given last week by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China that all cases must be reported, the count of those infected has increased markedly.
SNT.106081.5237	Eastern China saw a large number of cases in early March, but this information was not made public until late April.
SNT.106081.5238	In March, Children under age six in eastern Anhui province began being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the virus, and the outbreak spread quickly after that.
SNT.106081.5239	The city of Fuyang in Anhui province was especially hard-hit by the outbreak.
SNT.106081.5240	The majority of patients who were in critical condition have recovered, said a Health Ministry official in a statement on Monday.
SNT.106081.5241	"What I know is the death rate has gone down drastically since early May." 
SNT.106081.5242	 "There are very, very few cases with complications — 99 percent of these are mild cases", said World Health Organization (WHO) China representative Hans Troedsson in a statement on Wednesday.
SNT.106081.5243	Incidents of the disease are expected to peak in June and July.
SNT.106081.5244	Children with mild cases of the disease generally recover rapidly after manifesting a rash and a fever.
SNT.106081.5245	Other symptoms include diarrhea, cold-like symptoms, and sores on the extremities and mouth.
SNT.106081.5246	In severe cases, fluid may accumulate in the brain, and result in meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, paralysis and death.
SNT.106081.5247	The EV-71 virus is spread through contact with fluid secreted from blisters, nose and throat mucus, feces and saliva.
SNT.106081.5248	There is no specific treatment or vaccine for the virus.
SNT.106081.5249	The disease is unrelated to foot-and-mouth disease, which affects livestock.
SNT.106081.5250	United States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt was visiting in the country, and said in a statement Monday in Shanghai that the U.S. is assisting China fight the outbreak.
SNT.106081.5251	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, symptomatic treatment can be given to address possible fever and aches and pains.
SNT.106081.5252	The CDC advises children and adults to practice proper hand washing technique, and to wash and disinfect contaminated items and surfaces using diluted solution of chlorine-containing bleach.
SNT.106081.5253	China is also dealing with a magnitude-7.9 earthquake which hit the country Monday and has killed almost 15,000.
SNT.106081.5254	The outbreak is a concern to the government, as the country prepares for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing this August.
SNT.106081.5255	"We are confident the potential outbreak will not affect the Beijing Olympic Games," China's Health Ministry spokesman Mao Qunan stated.
SNT.106081.5256	And at a joint press conference held by China's Ministry of Health and the WHO, he further noted that, "China is confident that it can control the spread of the disease with effective prevention methods."
SNT.73731.5257	Venus Williams triumphed over Marion Bartoli of France 6-4, 6-1 yesterday to win the Women's Singles event at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships.
SNT.73731.5258	For the first time, an American and Frenchwoman were matched up to compete for the British women's singles title.
SNT.73731.5259	A Wimbledon champion in 2000, 2001 and 2005, Williams was not the favorite to win the title again this year.
SNT.73731.5260	Currently ranked 23rd in the world, she entered the tournament in the shadow of her sister, Serena Williams.
SNT.73731.5261	At the beginning of the tennis season, Serena stated her own determination to reclaim the No. 1 ranking.
SNT.73731.5262	Serena showed better than Venus at the French Open by reaching the quarter finals, and won the Australian Open in January (Venus dropped out due to an injury).
SNT.73731.5263	In spite of her initial strength, Serena's hopes to dominate the tournament were cut short when she lost to No. 1 seeded Justine Henin in the quarterfinals.
SNT.73731.5264	Bartoli, the eighteenth seed for this year's championships, had never progressed past the fourth round of any Grand Slam event.
SNT.73731.5265	However, she progressed to the final by defeating third seed Jelena Janković in the fourth round and Justine Henin in the semifinals in one of the major upsets of Wimbledon history.
SNT.73731.5266	As Henin lost to Bartoli in the semifinals, Venus Williams was poised to become the lowest seeded player in recorded history to win the Wimbledon singles title.
SNT.73731.5267	With powerhouse serves and an aggressive ground strokes battle, she did just that.
SNT.73731.5268	Williams comfortably knocked out Bartoli in two straight sets, with match point accidentally striking Bartoli in the wrist.
SNT.73731.5269	Venus was reunited with the Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court during the trophy ceremony.
SNT.73731.5270	Another first, the All England Club is paying men's and women's singles champions equal prize money.
SNT.73731.5271	Venus was paid $1.407 million, to which she replied "Thank you, All England Club - we're playing under equal terms."
SNT.73731.5272	The men's final takes place later today with first seed and defending champion Roger Federer taking on second seed Rafael Nadal in a repeat of last year's final.
SNT.46605.5273	A "highly pathogenic strain" of the H5N1 Avian Flu virus has been detected in a dead Australian black swan, floating in a pond located at the Dresden Zoo in Dresden, Germany.
SNT.46605.5274	Conflicting reports say that the swan was found on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
SNT.46605.5275	The Friedrich Loeffler Institute which specializes in animal diseases confirmed the test results.
SNT.46605.5276	"We can confirm that this is the highly pathogenic strain," said a spokesperson for the institute.
SNT.46605.5277	Officials have blocked off an area of Dresden approximately 1.9 miles (3km) from the site where the swan was found and have posted observation areas at approximately 6.2 miles (10km) outside the area as a precaution.
SNT.46605.5278	For the moment, all birds in the zoo have been confined to their cages and viewing of birds by the public is no longer permitted.
SNT.46605.5279	The zoo still remains open for business and cleaning efforts have been intensified.
SNT.46605.5280	Officials have also restricted cats and dogs from roaming areas nearby.
SNT.46605.5281	There are at least 112 different species of birds, totaling 720, located at the zoo.
SNT.46605.5282	In April, H5N1 was first discovered in Germany in a domestic fowl and in wild birds.
SNT.46605.5283	The last case of H5N1 to turn up in Germany was on May 12, 2006.
SNT.78430.5284	Finland's National Bureau of Investigation, a division of Finland's national police, has ten suspects currently, in its recent investigation into alleged dog fighting in the south of the country.
SNT.78430.5285	All the suspects are male Finns residing in southern Finland.
SNT.78430.5286	The new developments are the result of an investigation into four to six alleged dog fights.
SNT.78430.5287	Dog fighting is a breach of animal cruelty laws in Finland, and the case will be considered for prosecution in October.
SNT.78430.5288	They are being investigated under suspicion of breaching the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
SNT.78430.5289	At least thus far there has been no evidence of illegal gambling on the outcome of fights.
SNT.78430.5290	There also does not seem to be any large-scale organisation behind the incidents or connections with organised crime groupings.
SNT.78430.5291	"It would appear to be the pastime of a group of individuals."
SNT.78430.5292	Despite this, the group is known to have links throughout Scandinavia, as well as possible links to Russia.
SNT.78430.5293	He added that about a dozen pit bulls from America were involved in the incidents.
SNT.78430.5294	Key evidence includes video footage and testimony from veterinary surgeons, who were present when police raided several locations suspected to be involved.
SNT.78430.5295	"Statements by veterinary surgeons are a significant part of the investigation." 
SNT.78430.5296	"They play the same role here as forensic pathologists would in a normal violent crime investigation," Inspector Töyräs said.
SNT.78430.5297	The investigation was begun as a result of an investigation into dog fighting in the United Kingdom by the state-run British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
SNT.78430.5298	A BBC journalist teamed up with a man with military experience to infiltrate a notorious dog fighting ring from Ulster, Ireland, known as The Farmer Boys.
SNT.78430.5299	This uncovered links to a group involved in comparable activity in Finland.
SNT.78430.5300	The documentary, which is part of the Panorama series, was broadcast in Finland yesterday by YLE.
SNT.78430.5301	The BBC had contacted Finland regarding it's discoveries in April.
SNT.78430.5302	The BBC itself had begun it's investigation after Gerard Cavlan, a football player from Northern Ireland, was convicted on charges related to dog fighting.
SNT.78430.5303	Privacy laws in Finland required the faces of those believed to be involved to be pixelated during the Finnish version of the broadcast, although this was not mirrored in the UK screening - which, in an unprecedented move, coincided exactly with the showing in Finland.
SNT.78430.5304	The show was widely discussed on the internet, with large volumes of material requiring deleted by site administrators as breaching Finnish privacy legislation.
SNT.78430.5305	The investigation is the only one ever conducted into dog fighting in Finland.
SNT.78430.5306	Töyräs explained the problem to journalists: "We have only had vague unconnected hints of this sort of activity in the past, and on the basis of these it was not possible to mount an earlier investigation."
SNT.240117.5307	The sole United States manufacturer of a key component of lethal injections announced Friday that it will cease production of the drug, contributing to shortages and delaying executions.
SNT.240117.5308	Sodium thiopental, the first of a three drug cocktail used in 34 states to render the prisoner to be executed unconscious, was manufactured in Italy until Italian authorities stated that they would only license the manufacture if it was used for medical purposes and not, crucially, for executions.
SNT.240117.5309	In a statement, the company, Hospira, said that they have never condoned the use of their drug, marketed as 'Pentothal', in executions, and that they could not "prevent the drug from being diverted to departments of corrections for use in capital punishment procedures".
SNT.240117.5310	The move means that the United States is without a viable supplier for sodium thiopental.
SNT.240117.5311	Although many European countries manufacture the drug, which is primarily used in Europe as an anæsthetic, no manufacturer has been found that is willing to supply it for use in conjunction with the death penalty, the abolition of which has been lobbied by the EU since 2008.
SNT.240117.5312	The shortage means that executions in California and Oklahoma have been delayed, with Texas' last remaining stocks of the drug due to expire in March, weeks before two scheduled executions.
SNT.240117.5313	These delays are likely to be prolonged as the legal process of drawing up new drugs to be used for injections is lengthy.
SNT.240117.5314	Pentobarbital, an alternative which is used at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, is used for lethal injections in Oregon, and has started to be used by Oklahoma.
SNT.240117.5315	Hospira's decision caused mixed reactions throughout the medical community, with the American Society of Anesthesiologists stating Monday that sodium thiopental is an "important and medically necessary anesthetic agent" that is a "first-line anesthetic in many cases", citing geriatric and cardiovascular conditions, among others.
SNT.240117.5316	It said that, although they disagree with the death penalty, "we also do not condone using the issue as the basis to place undue burdens on the distribution of this critical drug to the United States."
SNT.240117.5317	"It is an unfortunate irony that many more lives will be lost or put in jeopardy as a result of not having the drug available for its legitimate medical use."
SNT.5688.5318	Brazilian federal police arrested Jesse James Hollywood, aged 25, in Saquarema city, Rio de Janeiro, on March 8.
SNT.5688.5319	James had been sought by the FBI for more than four years.
SNT.5688.5320	According to the police, he was living in Saquarema with a woman who is pregnant.
SNT.5688.5321	The two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty.
SNT.5688.5322	On Friday, James appeared in a Santa Barbara, California court for arraignment on charges of kidnapping and murdering a 15-year-old boy.
SNT.5688.5323	James will plead not guilty, according to his attorney, James E. Blatt.
SNT.5688.5324	Blatt also criticized the portrait prosecutors had painted of his client.
SNT.5688.5325	"Have you ever seen a 20 year-old mastermind? He was not the shooter," said Blat.
SNT.5688.5326	Blatt requested that the trial be continued on April 4.
SNT.24423.5327	The Wikimedia Foundation, the mother organization of the popular Wikipedia encyclopedia, and Answers.com, a search engine company, announced a new partnership.
SNT.24423.5328	This partnership will lead to the development of a special edition of Answers.com's 1-Click Answers tool, called 1-Click Answers, Wikipedia Edition.
SNT.24423.5329	The advertising revenues from this software will be split with the Wikimedia Foundation.
SNT.24423.5330	It will be linked from the English Wikipedia Tools page for a 60 day trial beginning in 2006.
SNT.24423.5331	Jimmy Wales, president of the Wikimedia Foundation, said he was pleased to partner with Answers.com, encouraging software that improves access to Wikipedia.
SNT.24423.5332	Bob Rosenschein, Answers.com's founder and CEO, told the media that Wikipedia is "the most dynamic of over 120 content sources found in Answers.com".

SNT.144319.5334	A wildlife official in Zimbabwe said today that the amount of animal poaching in the country has increased substantially this year, blaming an international crime syndicate.
SNT.144319.5335	He said that 65 elephants and 30 rhinoceroses have been killed this year by poachers.
SNT.144319.5336	"From January to October this year we have lost 65 elephants through poaching," said Vitalis Chadenga, the operations director of the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority.
SNT.144319.5337	"In the same period we have lost 24 black and six white rhinos. "
SNT.144319.5338	"It is true that we have witnessed an escalation of poaching nationwide, particularly on private farms."
SNT.144319.5339	"We do have a group of international gangsters, who are funding poachers around this part of the world and taking away many horns and it is a major problem," the director continued; "we have arrested 2,500 poachers in the same period, ten poachers have been shot dead since the beginning of this year."
SNT.144319.5340	Zimbabwe is one of four countries in Africa that are home to large numbers of rhinos, the others being Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa.
SNT.144319.5341	About 100,000 elephants live in Zimbabwe, and Chandenga said that the numbers have been growing in past years.
SNT.102178.5342	The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has blocked voting on legislation that would allow employers to rehire foreign seasonal workers.
SNT.102178.5343	This year, the U.S. government will only issue 33,000 visas for winter workers and 33,000 for summer workers.
SNT.102178.5344	This comes as a stark comparison to 2007, when 120,000 foreign workers entered the U.S. with H-2B visas.
SNT.102178.5345	Currently, the reduction in visas is having profounds effects on both Mexico and U.S.
SNT.102178.5346	In Tlapacoyan, a Mexican town which in the last 30 years has exported a large seasonal workforce, using H-2B visas, to work in U.S. circuses and carnivals, the effects are already a stark reality.
SNT.102178.5347	The local economy has been paralyzed, and unemployment has reached dramatic highs.
SNT.102178.5348	The lack of money being pumped into the local economy has caused many businesses to close, and the construction of the town's new church has come to a screeching halt.
SNT.102178.5349	Additionally, residents like Pablo Juarez Mendoza, who last year made $450 working in Texan livestock shows, are having difficulties finding local work.
SNT.102178.5350	Those that do, are only making an average of $50 per week.
SNT.102178.5351	U.S. businesses are getting ready to face their own set of economical obstacles caused by the lack of cheap labor.
SNT.102178.5352	Many employers are finding creative ways to cut costs, including scaling back operations.
SNT.102178.5353	In Cape Cod, for example, the local chamber of commerce reports that town employers will only receive 15 of the 5,000 visas requested.
SNT.102178.5354	In response, local Cape Cod business owner, Williman Zammer, has called the situation "a major crisis," and states that what the Hispanic Caucus is doing is "ruthless."
SNT.102178.5355	Opponents of the change state that recent legislation blocking is part of the Caucus' efforts to push for comprehensive immigration reform, not seen in the U.S. since the early 1980s.
SNT.102178.5356	Hispanic Caucus Chairman, Rep. Joe Baca, D-California, hopes that policymakers will place attention not only on helping small businesses, but also on what to do with 12 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the U.S., and improving border security.
SNT.102178.5357	The issue of immigration has become a polarizing subject in the U.S., and one that has been an intrinsic part of the fabric that makes up the American society.
SNT.102178.5358	Since 2006, the U.S. accepts more legal immigrants as permanent residents than any other country in the world.
SNT.102178.5359	That same year, a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that the U.S. public was equally divided on the whether immigration helps or hurts the country.
SNT.102178.5360	Forty-four percent said it helped, forty-five percent said it hurt.
SNT.102178.5361	However, a recent Pew Research Center study suggests that the issue will remain at the forefront of the American political agenda for many years to come.
SNT.102178.5362	The study revealed that by 2050, one in five Americans will be foreign-born, and the overall U.S. population will double to 438 million.
SNT.102178.5363	The U.S Latino population will account for 30% of the population, while Asians will account for 9%.
SNT.102178.5364	Thus, what we see unfolding is a U.S. where minorities will become the majority, and drastic cultural and societal changes seem almost certain.
SNT.102178.5365	The study seems to also hint that this growth is in many ways connected to legislation passed by Congress in 1965, that abolished a quota system that had nearly ended immigration from non-European countries since the 1920s, and consequently caused an immigration surge.
SNT.229998.5366	The United Nations and French peacekeeping forces say they will not leave the Ivory Coast despite orders from incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo to leave the country.
SNT.229998.5367	Secretary General of the UN Ban Ki-moon said in a statement that the UN in the Ivory Coast will "fulfill its mandate and will continue to monitor and document any human rights violations, incitement to hatred and violence, or attacks on U.N. peacekeepers."
SNT.229998.5368	He also called the orders for all peacekeeping troops to leave the nation irrelevant and without effect, adding that the UN does not believe Gbagbo is the legal president.
SNT.229998.5369	"The president-elect is Ouattara and he hasn't asked us to leave," added the UN.
SNT.111909.5370	Cuban Taekwondo athlete Ángel Matos was banned for life yesterday after an assault on Swedish referee Chakir Chelbat during the 2008 Beijing Olympic games.
SNT.111909.5371	Matos was competing in the bronze medal match against Arman Chilmanov of Kazakhstan when he sustained an injury.
SNT.111909.5372	As he lay on the mat with medical attendants, Matos was disqualified for exceeding the one minute injury time limit.
SNT.111909.5373	When Chilmanov was declared the winner of the bout, Matos delivered a kick to the face of Chelbat.
SNT.111909.5374	Touch judges rushed in to try to control the situation.
SNT.111909.5375	Matos pushed one of them and then spat on the floor.
SNT.111909.5376	Both Matos and his coach Leudis Gonzalez were banned for life from all official Taekwondo events for their behavior in the incident.
SNT.111909.5377	The World Taekwondo Federation released a statement referring to the incident as a "strong violation of the spirit of Taekwondo and the Olympic Games".
SNT.111909.5378	They also called for all records of Matos to be removed from the Olympic records.
SNT.111909.5379	Later coach Leudis Gonzalez claimed the Kazaks offered him money to lose the bout.
SNT.111909.5380	WTF secretary general Yang Jin-suk said "due process must be followed before officially banning the two."
SNT.111909.5381	Matos won the gold medal in Sydney in 2000; he finished in 11th place in Athens four years later.
SNT.41068.5382	The Canterbury Bulldogs, a team in Australia's National Rugby League, has entered into an agreement with New South Wales police to provide extra police at all games in NSW.
SNT.41068.5383	The agreement follows a spate of violent incidents at Bulldogs matches this year.
SNT.41068.5384	In March, there were fights during and after a game between the Bulldogs and Wests Tigers at Telstra Stadium, the Bulldogs home ground.
SNT.41068.5385	This led police to step up their presence at Bulldogs matches for the rest of the season.
SNT.41068.5386	A month later, a group of Bulldogs supporters abused four South Sydney cheerleaders at another home match.
SNT.41068.5387	According to NSW Police, a meeting was held between the police executive and Bulldogs CEO, Malcolm Noad where it was decided that the club will pay for additional police at all Bulldogs games across NSW.
SNT.41068.5388	The additional police will include specialist police (including riot police) to provide security for spectators.
SNT.41068.5389	Only police that are working outside their normal rostered hours will be paid for by the club.
SNT.41068.5390	The police Commander of the North West Sydney region, Assistant Commissioner said he was pleased that the club was working with the police proactively.
SNT.41068.5391	"It is pleasing to see the club taking a proactive stance to ensure the games proceed with a strong police presence to provide increased safety" he said.
SNT.41068.5392	Assistant Commissioner Clifford warned that police would not be specifically targeting Bulldogs supporters, but anyone who is causing trouble at games.
SNT.41068.5393	"It is hoped this initiative will stamp out violence at future Bulldogs matches." 
SNT.41068.5394	"Police will be targeting anyone doing the wrong thing, regardless of which team they support."he said.

SNT.143610.5398	The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the H1N1 virus, more commonly known as swine flu, has become the dominant flu strain in the world.
SNT.143610.5399	In a briefing with reporters Thursday, WHO Special Pandemic Influenza Advisor Keiji Fukuda said the virus has been particularly active in the Northern Hemisphere in recent months.
SNT.143610.5400	He added that he expects the trend to continue through the winter months, with more severe cases and even deaths.
SNT.143610.5401	Fukuda said the vaccine currently in use in some 20 countries around the world remains effective and safe, and that no rare or dangerous side effects have been reported.
SNT.143610.5402	"East Asia is one of the parts of the world where seasonal influenza viruses have remained in reasonably high circulation." 
SNT.143610.5403	 "But even in that part of the world, the pandemic virus is becoming dominant," Fukuda commented.
SNT.143610.5404	He noted that it was difficult to predict the activity of the virus.
SNT.143610.5405	The H1N1 virus differs from the normal seasonal flu in that it has persisted during the summer months and affected relatively healthy people under the age of 65.
SNT.143610.5406	The WHO says most people recover without hospitalization, although Fuduka pointed out that people with severe health complications and pregnant women were most at risk.
SNT.143610.5407	The World Health Organization has declared the swine flu outbreak a pandemic.
SNT.143610.5408	As of October 25, 2009, the WHO says there have been more than 440,000 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza and more than 5,700 deaths reported to the UN agency.
SNT.1041.5409	In the United Kingdom, the music video for this Christmas' remake of the charity single Do They Know It's Christmas? was launched simultaneously today (Thursday) on several UK and Irish television channels including BBC One, BBC Two, RTE 1, ITV1, Channel 4, and Sky One.
SNT.1041.5410	The song was originally recorded in 1984 by several of the biggest artists of the time including Bono, Bob Geldof, Paul McCartney and George Michael.
SNT.1041.5411	This year, in celebration of 20 years since the first single, the song has been remade by over 50 of today's best selling artists, including Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Robbie Williams, Bono, Justin Hawkins of The Darkness and Dido.
SNT.1041.5412	The song, which is in aid of charity, is already tipped to be the Christmas No. 1 in the UK and Ireland.
SNT.1041.5413	The song will also be launched as a charity mobile phone ringtone to raise funds for Sudan's troubled Darfur region.
SNT.1041.5414	Mycokemusic.com said it was going to put the track on its website from Thursday with all profits to be donated to charity.
SNT.1041.5415	The single will be available to buy in shops from the 29 November.
SNT.46694.5416	The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that a British soldier has been killed in southern Afghanistan during a joint operation with Canadian-led NATO troops.
SNT.46694.5417	It is with regret that we can confirm that a member of the UK Armed Forces has been killed in action this afternoon during ongoing operations against insurgent positions in Helmand Province, Southern Afghanistan, said an MOD statement.
SNT.46694.5418	According to a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force, a NATO peacekeeping organisation, troops came under fire after a successful operation.
SNT.46694.5419	The soldier’s details have not been released as next of kin have not yet been told.
SNT.46694.5420	In the past two months, ten British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan.
SNT.46694.5421	The Sunday Telegraph today quoted commandos as saying British troops in Afghanistan are on "the brink of exhaustion".
SNT.142333.5422	Pakistani armed forces say they have captured the town of Kotkai on Saturday, the hometown of Taliban Chief Hakimullah Mehsud and one of his top officers, Qari Hussain.
SNT.142333.5423	This comes after a week-long battle was launched on Monday, in part of an operation to curb the influence of the Taliban in South Waziristan.
SNT.142333.5424	The operation began the previous Saturday when Pakistani forces approached from three separate areas of South Waziristan.
SNT.142333.5425	Pakistan plans to trap Taliban within the area while approaching the towns of Makeen and Ladha, both of which are major Taliban strongholds.
SNT.142333.5426	Major General Athar Abbas, the chief spokesman for the military, said at a news briefing that "we have complete control of Kotkai, a stronghold of the terrorists, where most of the houses had been converted into strong bunkers."
SNT.142333.5427	So far, Pakistani officials have reported that 163 militants have been killed, while the military sustained 23 casualties.
SNT.142333.5428	The entire area has been closed off, but there have been recent acts of violence which have officials worried.
SNT.142333.5429	In recent weeks, Pakistan has seen attacks on police centers, military headquarters and a UN building.
SNT.142333.5430	There have also been five attacks on an Islamic university in Islamabad, the capital.
SNT.142333.5431	It has been reported that over 21,000 civilian families, an estimated 153,000 individuals, have fled South Waziristan, and have taken refuge in the North-West Frontier Province.
SNT.120763.5432	At least one fisherman has died and 134 others were rescued on Lake Erie off the shores of Ohio after an eight mile wide piece of ice broke off the frozen lake's ice shelf and began to drift.
SNT.120763.5433	The United States Coast Guard says the unidentified man who died fell into the water while trying to find a way off the ice.
SNT.120763.5434	Rescuers were able to get him out of the water, but he died while being flown to a nearby hospital for treatment.
SNT.120763.5435	The Coast Guard also said that the fishermen were warned that the ice could break, but many didn't believe there was any danger.
SNT.120763.5436	Before heading onto the already broken ice, they made a makeshift bridge from wooden pallets to get to and from the shore, but the ice shifted and the bridge was destroyed.
SNT.120763.5437	It left all 135 people stranded more than 1,000 yards from the shoreline.
SNT.120763.5438	The ice in most parts of the lake can be up to two feet thick, but on Saturday temperatures rose above freezing, with winds of over 35 miles per hour.
SNT.120763.5439	The combination of both high winds and temperatures, broke the thick ice into dozens of large pieces.
SNT.120763.5440	Ottawa County sheriff Bob Bratton called those who avoided the warnings "idiotic".
SNT.120763.5441	"I don't know how else to put it," stated Bratton.
SNT.120763.5442	Lake Erie is the fourth largest lake of the five Great Lakes in the U.S., but the smallest by volume, and the tenth largest fresh water lake in the world.
SNT.120763.5443	Several helicopters were called in from Detroit, Michigan and Traverse City.
SNT.22119.5444	The body’s immune system is less effective at quashing disease than it could be - but if it were better the immune system might do more harm than good, according to new research by Michael Deem and colleagues of Rice University in Houston.
SNT.22119.5445	The immune system has apparently evolved to be mildly inefficient so that it achieves a balance between quick response to disease and decreased probability of autoimmune disease, a condition in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue.
SNT.22119.5446	The authors drew their conclusions from a model of the dynamics of antibody evolution.
SNT.22119.5447	Their simulations show that while there are mechanisms that would allow the immune system to develop antibodies that respond faster and more strongly against invading pathogens, those mechanisms would also create antibodies that are likely to attack the body’s own healthy cells.
SNT.22119.5448	The model also bolsters controversial suggestions that chronic infections could lead the immune system awry, ultimately resulting in rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune ailments.
SNT.22119.5449	The study will be detailed in a forthcoming issue of the journal Physical Review Letters.
SNT.108683.5450	The process of reconciliation and unifying the Democratic party started at the ballroom of the Mayflower hotel in Washington, DC with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and his wife both individually issuing a check amounting to $2,300 to the Hillary Clinton for President committee.
SNT.108683.5451	New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton introduced to her fund contributors Illinois Senator Barack Obama as the first step of unifying the two sides who quite recently bitterly fought over winning the Democratic party's nomination.
SNT.108683.5452	Hillary Clinton appealed to her supporters to help Barack Obama and pledged that she will personally help in defeating the presidential plans of Republican presumptive Presidential candidate, Arizona senator John McCain.
SNT.108683.5453	Mrs. Clinton asked for nothing in exchange for her support of Obama, but Obama instead countered with a gesture of contributing to Mrs. Clinton campaign that is now burdened by debt.
SNT.108683.5454	Obama signaled his own contributors to help Clinton pay off the debt incurred by her campaign.
SNT.119919.5455	The United Kingdom's flag carrier airline, British Airways (BA) has warned the markets that it will post a full year loss of up to £150 million.
SNT.119919.5456	The former state airline, privatised in 1987, saw its shares fall 8.5% on the back of an announcement that "further economic weakness in January and the outlook for February and March combined with the fall in sterling are impacting our outlook for the year", according to The Daily Telegraph.
SNT.119919.5457	Quarterly revenues are still anticipated to grow by 4%, but a full-year loss is now expected.
SNT.119919.5458	Costs have risen in recent months, whilst the historic lows of sterling have hit the bottom line.
SNT.119919.5459	First and Business Class traffic has fallen as the global credit crisis has hit premium and business travel.
SNT.119919.5460	Fuel costs have fallen, but previous hedging has negated this benefit.
SNT.119919.5461	The airline has been considering a merger with Spanish flag carrier Iberia, but The Guardian, relaying Reuters, reports that Iberia now has a larger market capitalisation than BA, changing the field of play.
SNT.119919.5462	The airline sector in general is facing trouble, with American and United posting fourth quarter losses and the Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM issuing a profits warning.
SNT.127184.5463	According to an original Reuters report, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez is moving his Bolivarian Revolution forward by nationalizing more private companies and clamping down against his opponents.
SNT.127184.5464	Some oil service companies were nationalized earlier this month along with other sectors like banking, cement and steel.
SNT.127184.5465	Cited by Reuters, Chavez said on Saturday "We are proceeding and will continue to proceed with nationalizations of strategic sectors."
SNT.127184.5466	According to The Financial Post, expropriation of oil service companies follows their dispute with Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the State-owned oil company.
SNT.127184.5467	Past election victories since 1997 have strengthened Chavez's control and popularity (with more than 60% approval rating).
SNT.127184.5468	He won a February referendum amending the constitution and letting him stay in power until he is not re-elected.
SNT.127184.5469	Chavez, cited by Reuters, told party activists in April "I've said it before and I repeat, we must keep up the offensive, bulldozing the counter-revolution."
SNT.127184.5470	But the financial crisis, especially the low oil prices for the last months, has crippled his social revolution.
SNT.127184.5471	During the last years, Chavez relied on high oil prices to push his social agenda.
SNT.127184.5472	With the shortening of cash, Chavez cannot use oil revenues anymore to finance his budget.
SNT.127184.5473	This wave of expropriation and the conflicts with oil service companies seems to reflect a desperate move to tackle the crisis, despite Chavez's words that the country is "well-equipped to weather the global recession."
SNT.15034.5474	A boxer is missing in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, after it chased off a bear to protect three children.
SNT.15034.5475	According to Bill Rusko, the father of two of the children, the bear crossed Route 30 in Ligonier Township and moved towards the three kids as they played badminton.
SNT.15034.5476	The year-old dog, Major, then ran around the bear to distract it and bit it in the face.
SNT.15034.5477	As the bear ran back into the woods, the dog chased it.
SNT.15034.5478	It remains missing; however, neighbors say they saw it in the area.
SNT.79134.5479	Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced that leaders of APEC nations have agreed on "aspirational goals" on climate change.
SNT.79134.5480	The agreement, which Prime Minister Howard calls the Sydney declaration focuses on reducing energy intensity (the amount of energy used to produce a dollar of gross domestic product), reforestation and technology sharing.
SNT.79134.5481	Despite Australia, the United States and China being non-signatories to the United Nations' Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reductions which is set to expire in 2012, the APEC accord calls for "We call for a post-2012 international climate change arrangement ... that strengthens, broadens and deepens the current arrangement and leads to reduced global emissions of greenhouse gases," according to the draft declaration.
SNT.79134.5482	The declaration as agreed upon will be released on Sunday.
SNT.79134.5483	The draft agreement recognised that action was required to "slow, stop and reverse" greenhouse gas emissions; that nations should vow to reduce energy intensity by 25 percent by 2030; that forest cover in the region should be increased by 50 million acres by 2020; and that APEC nations will work with other nations to find a solution to climate change.
SNT.79134.5484	The declaration is non-binding and is simply a statement of goals to which the nations will try to achieve.
SNT.79134.5485	Host nation Australia has been criticised by China, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia for putting climate change on the agenda at the APEC summit, saying they would prefer dialogue on climate change to occur under a United Nationa framework.
SNT.79134.5486	Indonesia's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda said "the APEC meeting does not replace the appropriate forum to deal with climate change."
SNT.79134.5487	Mr Wiraydua said that despite Indonesia not being entirely satisfied with the declaration they would "live with it".
SNT.79134.5488	Environmental group Greenpeace has rejected the APEC statement because it doesn't set firm targets and includes the use of nuclear energy as a replacement for fossil fuels.
SNT.131450.5489	Baitullah Mehsud, amīr (leader) of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), is dead, said two Taliban leaders in a phone call to the BBC.
SNT.131450.5490	Mehsud was reportedly killed on August 5, 2009, during a U.S. drone attack on South Waziristan; however, Hakimullah Mehsud, who was recently chosen as Baitullah's successor, and Wali-ur-Rehman told the BBC that Mehsud had died on Sunday, August 23, 2009 of injuries sustained on August 5.
SNT.131450.5491	Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik delayed giving official confirmation and asked for patience and an announcement by ISPR or other agencies.
SNT.131450.5492	Major General Athar Abbas, ISPR spokesman, and Robert Gibbs of the White House had said that his death could not be confirmed although U.S. National Security Adviser James L. Jones had claimed that there was "pretty conclusive" evidence that proved Baitullah Mehsud had been killed and that he was 90% sure of it.
SNT.131450.5493	Pakistan blamed him for numerous attacks including the assassination in 2007 of Benazir Bhutto, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan and wife of President Asif Ali Zardari, according to Bloomberg News.
SNT.131450.5494	The U.S. offered a US$5 million bounty for his capture.
SNT.131450.5495	According to the BBC, Pakistan had been unable to provide tangible evidence of his death because of the "remote and hostile terrain" of South Waziristan.
SNT.147258.5496	A court in Salé sentenced fourteen members of Fath Al Andalous (Conquest of Andalusia) to jail yesterday for planning attacks against targets in Morocco.
SNT.147258.5497	The radical group reportedly associates itself with expulsion of Muslims from the Andalusia region of Spain during the fifteenth century.
SNT.147258.5498	According to state agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the court sentenced leader Rachid Zerbani to fifteen years in prison and fined him 500,000 dirhams (€44,175), and the remaining thirteen to four to ten years for "setting up a criminal gang to plot and carry out terror acts aimed at disturbing public order through intimidation and violence, financing terrorism, manufacturing and possessing explosives, undermining the sacred values, and holding unauthorized public meetings."
SNT.147258.5499	The group, which according to MAP had links with similar organisations in Algeria, Mauritania, France, Spain, and countries in the Middle East, had plotted to attack tourist locations in Agadir as well as a military barracks in Laayoune, the principal city in the Western Sahara region.
SNT.147258.5500	According to the police, the members had obtained electronics and chemicals used in bombs.
SNT.147258.5501	Since the 2003 Casablanca bombings, in which 45 people died, the country has broken up over sixty similar groups, with more than 2,000 tried and jailed.
SNT.99284.5502	The Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is due to meet the French President Nicholas Sarkozy later today.
SNT.99284.5503	Lula da Silva is due to meet with Sarkozy in French Guiana.
SNT.99284.5504	The two are expected discuss issues such as greater cooperation between the two countries and the coordination of work on areas around Brazil and French Guiana.
SNT.99284.5505	In addition, subjects such as biofuels, nuclear science and defence are expected to be discussed in the meeting.

SNT.99284.5507	Initial forecasts are suggesting that the bridge, will be about 400 meters long, and will cost approximately US$38.6 million.
SNT.99284.5508	The cost of the project is planned to be divided equally between Brazil and France.
SNT.99284.5509	This was made clear in an agreement between the two nations that was signed in July 2005.
SNT.99284.5510	The agreement was approved by the Brazilian government in November 2007 and was approved by the French Parliament in March 2007.
SNT.38087.5511	Glen Stollery is a New Zealand website developer who created the site ScienTOMogy.info in mid 2005.
SNT.38087.5512	The site, which is a parody of Tom Cruise and his involvement with the Church of Scientology, became the centre of controversy when it was served with a number of cease and desist orders initiated by the Church.
SNT.38087.5513	On March 19, 2006, Glen issued a media release stating that his web hosting provider, YouTube, had removed videos of Tom Cruise which formed part of the site.
SNT.38087.5514	The release suggested that YouTube had taken this action under external pressure from Cruise or Viacom.
SNT.38087.5515	Responding to a query by Wikinews reporters, YouTube stated "We have not received a DMCA notification letter from Viacom."
SNT.38087.5516	The Church of Scientology was offered the opportunity to respond to the claims made by Stollery during the interview.
SNT.38087.5517	This exclusive interview deals with these issues and others relating to the website.
SNT.38087.5518	It was conducted with Glen via email between March 21 and April 3, 2006.
SNT.79368.5519	According to al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden will release yet another video which is said to contain a will and testament from one of the September 11, 2001 hijackers, Abu Musab Waleed al-Shehri.
SNT.79368.5520	The second tape was reportedly recorded from the same spot as the video that was released last week.
SNT.79368.5521	"Coming soon, God willing, from the testaments of the martyrs of the New York and Washington attacks: The testament of the martyr Abu Musab Waleed al-Shehri, presented by Sheik Osama bin Laden, God preserve him," said a banner that was posted by As-Sahab on an extremist website which is frequented by al-Qaeda and other extremists.
SNT.79368.5522	According to the United States based terrorist monitoring group, IntelCenter, the video will be released within the next 24 hours, but it is not known if bin Laden will actually appear in the video, or if an audio recording of his voice will just be present.
SNT.79368.5523	Some reports suggest that the video will feature new images of bin Laden.
SNT.79368.5524	Bin Laden appeared for the first time in a video since 2004 when he released a video on September 7, 2007.
SNT.3593.5525	Nuclearelectrica considers the security of the plant, as well as of its employees and the environment, to be of utmost importance.
SNT.3593.5526	In the future, the nuclear plant is expected to produce a significant amount of the electrical energy of southeastern Europe.
SNT.3593.5527	CANDU reactors, which are designed in Canada, are one of the most advantageous forms of nuclear reactors due to their fuel efficiency and low amount of down-time.
SNT.99532.5528	There were 8 games played in the National Hockey League on February 14, 2008, including the #2 Dallas Stars taking on the Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks fighting for playoff contention in the Northwest division.
SNT.39609.5529	About 100 people protested the detention and treatment of 13 men accused of terrorism offences and held at the Barwon maximum security prison, in the state of Victoria, Australia.
SNT.39609.5530	The protestors bussed and drove 56km from Melbourne out to the Barwon maximum security prison to voice their disapproval of the treatment of the 13 men accused of terror offences who are currently being held in the Acacia Unit of the prison.
SNT.39609.5531	Some of the accused have been held in solitary confinement for 6 months up to and during their trial.
SNT.39609.5532	The group Civil Rights Defence organised the event with family members of the accused and news reporters as a peaceful protest.
SNT.39609.5533	A small group of about 15 police officers awaited the arrival of the group.
SNT.39609.5534	The police said that their main concern was the health and safety of everyone as the protest was being held next to a busy road.
SNT.39609.5535	Officers only approached when the Country Fire Authority was summoned by a passerby to put out an open camp fire, as there was fire restriction in effect in the area.
SNT.39609.5536	The fire fighters were met with laughter and sarcastic applause.
SNT.39609.5537	In a statement read at the protest, one of the accused and his wife (Eman Abdou and Shane Kent) said they were upset at the Australian media for participating in lying to the Australian public and the government for the way they have treated the accused.
SNT.39609.5538	"I believe the conditions out at the Barwon Prison Acacua Unit are oppressive and inhumane." 
SNT.39609.5539	 "Furthermore I am upset at the Australian media for participating in lying to the Australian public." 
SNT.39609.5540	 "These men have a right to a fair trial, and everyone is innocent until proven guilty," the statement read.
SNT.39609.5541	The statement also went on say that the limited legal visits were often shortened and that the best treated accused are in solitary confinement for 18 hours a day while some are in solitary confinement consistently.
SNT.39609.5542	Omar Mehri, the brother of one of the accused spoke at the day's event and talked about verbal harassment and hate mail he and his family have received.
SNT.39609.5543	He also talked of his brother being amazed to see grass after 5 months.
SNT.39609.5544	Speakers at the event said the current laws used to prosecute murderers and other criminals should be used to prosecute terrorist suspects and had the same sentiments as Eman Abdou and Shane Kent.
SNT.39609.5545	They said the laws were unjust and the treatment of the accused was cruel and unusual, constituting torture under the terms of the UN charter.
SNT.39609.5546	Omar Merhi, brother of one of the detained said in a statement "My brother and the other arrested men are confused and want to know why they are in Australia's highest security unit for simply practising their religion."
SNT.196438.5547	A televised debate between Australia's candidates for Prime Minister in the upcoming election has been rescheduled and shortened — to avoid a clash with popular cookery show MasterChef.
SNT.196438.5548	The pre-election debate traditionally lasts 90 minutes and occurs at 1930 on the first Sunday of the campaign.
SNT.196438.5549	With the grand finale of the cooking competition already scheduled for that time, and expected to attract around four million viewers, the decision has been made to move the debate forward to 1830 and shorten it to 60 minutes.
SNT.196438.5550	When asked about MasterChef, Prime Minister Julia Gillard replied: "I can understand the fascination with cooking and eating, so I know many Australians will watch that show. "
SNT.196438.5551	"But I think Australians still pay some regard to the debate and the election campaign."
SNT.196438.5552	The debate between Gillard and her Liberal/National Coalition primary opponent Tony Abbott has already been the subject of controversy.
SNT.196438.5553	Former PM Kevin Rudd had committed to holding three debates before the election.
SNT.196438.5554	Australian Greens leader Bob Brown had also wished to be part of the debate, but joked that he probably had more chance of appearing on MasterChef.
SNT.22819.5555	According to the first exit polls published by TNS OBOP and PBS for TVP1 Polish public television station, the Law and Justice (PiS) party has won today's parliamentary election in Poland with a 27,6% result.

SNT.22819.5557	PO and PiS, both of which will form the future government, will have 304 places in the new Sejm, which is 3 less than is required for making changes to the Polish constitution, which both parties support.
SNT.130530.5558	A fifth child has died as a result of a police pursuit that ended in a crash in Dinuba, California on Sunday, August 9.
SNT.130530.5559	Carlos Eric Salazar, aged 8, was the eighth victim to die as a result of the crash.
SNT.130530.5560	On Sunday, four children were among seven that were killed when the pursued suspect who, after refusing to stop for police, slammed into the GMC Sierra pickup truck carrying a family, two adults and five children.
SNT.130530.5561	The family was on their way to attend a football game for youths when the crash occurred.
SNT.130530.5562	Four of the children were ejected from the truck and died at the scene.
SNT.130530.5563	The two adults and one child were taken to Community Regional Medical Center located in Fresno.
SNT.130530.5564	Both vehicles collided with lemon trees at an orchard near the intersection of Avenue 424 and Road 120 in Dinuba.
SNT.130530.5565	Three people, including the suspect, were in a stolen 2005 Dodge Neon and also died at the scene.

SNT.130530.5569	None of the victims in the pickup were wearing seat belts, according to Fox News.
SNT.5462.5570	Insulin production has been discovered in the brain and linked to Alzheimer's disease, potentially changing how the illness is viewed and treated.
SNT.5462.5571	While insulin resistance, a characteristic of diabetes, is linked with neurodegeneration, the new finding provides a strong connection between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
SNT.5462.5572	"What we found is that insulin is not just produced in the pancreas, but also in the brain," says study senior author Suzanne de la Monte of Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University Medical School.
SNT.5462.5573	"And we discovered that insulin and its growth factors, which are necessary for the survival of brain cells, contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's."
SNT.5462.5574	The finding was made by studying a genetic abnormality in rats that blocks insulin signaling in the brain.
SNT.5462.5575	Additionally, they determined that a drop in insulin production in the brain contributes to brain cell degeneration, a symptom of Alzheimer's.
SNT.5462.5576	These abnormalities do not correspond to type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but reflect a different and more complex disease process that originates in the CNS (central nervous system), the researchers report.
SNT.5462.5577	Analysis of postmortem brain tissue also revealed that the proteins aren't produced at normal levels in human Alzheimer's sufferers.
SNT.5462.5578	Insulin and IGF I were significantly reduced in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus—all areas affected by Alzheimer's—while not in the cerebellum, which is generally not affected by Alzheimer's.
SNT.5462.5579	The study "opens the way for targeted treatment to the brain and changes the way we view Alzheimer's disease," says de la Monte.
SNT.5462.5580	The research is reported in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.
SNT.102053.5581	A tornado, spawned from a large storm, has hit the United States city of Atlanta, Georgia, causing extensive damage throughout the city.
SNT.102053.5582	The National Weather Service confirmed Saturday morning that it was a tornado that struck the city.
SNT.102053.5583	After reviewing the aftermath of the storm, they classified it as an EF2 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale.
SNT.102053.5584	Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin says she is beginning to apply for federal disaster aid.
SNT.102053.5585	There have been no confirmed deaths, but the mayor's spokeswoman says there may be dead victims trapped within the ruins of a collapsed loft complex.
SNT.102053.5586	The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts are located in the historic Cabbagetown neighborhood, where at least 20 homes were destroyed.
SNT.102053.5587	It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III, said Mahsud Olufani, who has an art studio in the neighbourhood.
SNT.102053.5588	At least 27 people suffered injuries, mostly cuts and bruises.
SNT.102053.5589	Grady Memorial Hospital, where many of the injured were taken, had suffered some window damage but was still operating.
SNT.102053.5590	Around 50 people have been taken to a local Red Cross shelter for displaced residents.
SNT.102053.5591	The tornado struck during the semifinal game of the SEC Basktetball Tournament between Mississippi State and Alabama.
SNT.102053.5592	Play was stopped with around 2 minutes to go in overtime when heavy wind could be heard outside with rippling of the roof.
SNT.102053.5593	Damage was done to the roof as debris fell to the floor.
SNT.102053.5594	"I thought it was a tornado or a terrorist attack," said Mississippi State guard Ben Hansbrough.
SNT.102053.5595	A tornado warning was issued for the downtown area a few minutes before the storm hit.
SNT.102053.5596	"Ironically, the guy behind me got a phone call saying there was a tornado warning," said Lisa Lynn, who was attending the game at the Georgia Dome.
SNT.102053.5597	And in two seconds, we heard the noise and things started to shake. 
SNT.102053.5598	The CNN Center in downtown Atlanta was severely damaged, especially in the atrium, where the ravaged ceiling allowed water to pour in.
SNT.102053.5599	Police closed several streets near the CNN Center because of the debris, which included power lines, billboards, and even office chairs.
SNT.102053.5600	The Omni Hotel, which is attached to the CNN Center, also sustained damage, with many of its windows shattered.
SNT.102053.5601	Visitors at the hotel were evacuated to the exhibition hall at street level.
SNT.102053.5602	" There was a lot of windows breaking and stuff falling," said Terrence Evans, a valet at the hotel.
SNT.102053.5603	At Centennial Olympic Park, located near CNN and the Omni Hotel, two Olympic torch sculptures had fallen over, and a performance pavilion was destroyed.
SNT.102053.5604	A high-rise dorm at Georgia State University was damaged by the tornado, as evidenced by a large hole in the building's 14th floor.
SNT.102053.5605	According to Georgia Power, more than 13,000 of their customers are currently without electricity.
SNT.102053.5606	Crews are working to fix downed power lines, but they said it would be difficult with all the debris.
SNT.102053.5607	Another large storm, currently in Mississippi, is heading towards Atlanta, and is forecast to arrive around 3 p.m. 
SNT.102053.5607-1	National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Leary said Friday's storm could be "nothing to compare with what's coming in tomorrow".
SNT.102053.5608	All downtown events scheduled to occur Saturday have been cancelled.
SNT.102053.5609	The remaining SEC tournament games are to be played at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum, located in the undamaged midtown.
SNT.487585.5610	Dozens of people have been killed as a result of flooding in Plateau State, located in the central part of Nigeria.
SNT.487585.5611	The flooding occurred as the result of a large amount of rainfall close to Jos, a city in the north of the state, causing overflow of a dam.
SNT.487585.5612	The Red Cross has reported the recovery of 35 corpses, while BBC News Online has placed the death toll at a minimum of 39.
SNT.487585.5613	A spokesperson for the Red Cross said approximately two hundred houses had been sunk or wrecked.
SNT.487585.5614	A significant number of the affected houses had been built of mud.
SNT.487585.5615	Manasie Phampe, leader of the Red Cross of the state, explained: "Rainwater and water from the Lamingo dam which overflowed swept across several neighbourhoods in the city".
SNT.487585.5616	The death toll is anticipated to increase by authorities, with 35 reported missing.
SNT.487585.5617	"We are still searching for more bodies as many people have been declared missing," Phampe added.
SNT.37639.5618	At least 57 people are now known to have died when a boat designed similar to a traditional dhow capsized one mile of the coast of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf.
SNT.37639.5619	Seventeen were Indian and a further 13 of the dead are British; people of another six nationalities are also known to have died.
SNT.37639.5620	The passengers were mostly foreigners from the Nass-Murray and Roberts construction company, and were enjoying an evening dinner cruise in celebration of their completion of part of the Bahrain World Trade Centre towers.
SNT.37639.5621	Most who died were dining on the lower deck, and were trapped below.
SNT.37639.5622	Over 130 people were onboard the boat at the time, although some say the boat was only licensed to carry 120.
SNT.37639.5623	The boat capsized in calm seas soon after it left, trapping many below.
SNT.37639.5624	Helicopters from the US Navy searched for 13 missing persons until Friday morning, when the search was called off.
SNT.37639.5625	The dhow had been modified to have an extra, higher deck making the vessel less stable.
SNT.37639.5626	The exact cause is unknown - suggestions from eyewitnesses include the boat suddenly turning left, being hit by a wave, and many of the passengers moving to one side of the boat together.
SNT.37639.5627	The Bahrain Interior Ministry is to investigate the accident and establish if the boat was seaworthy.
SNT.27377.5628	Professor Paul Mirecki, the chairman of the Religious Studies Department at the University of Kansas, was hospitalized after being assaulted by two unidentified men who made references to the class he had planned to teach in the spring.
SNT.27377.5629	The course, entitled "Special Topics in Religion: Intelligent Design, Creationism and other Religious Mythologies" was intended to support evolution, and explore creationism as a mythology.
SNT.27377.5630	Professor Mirecki had left his home and was driving to breakfast when he noticed the men tailgating him in a pickup truck.
SNT.27377.5631	He said, "I just pulled over hoping they would pass, and then they pulled up real close behind."
SNT.27377.5632	"They got out, and I made the mistake of getting out."
SNT.27377.5633	John Calvert, managing director of the Intelligent Design Network, had previously objected to Professor Mirecki's focus on creationism as mythology, and claimed that the religious studies professor was "labeling anybody who proposes [intelligent design] to be simply a religious nut".
SNT.27377.5634	Paul Mirecki had already decided to cancel the course after he caused controversy by using the slang term "fundies" to refer to Christian Fundamentalists in an email to a student organization, the Society for Open Minded Atheists and Agnostics.
SNT.27377.5635	Professor Mirecki has apologized for using the term, which is viewed as a slur by some conservatives.
SNT.46241.5636	The Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle building in Seattle, Washington was the site of a shooting on at around 4 pm on July 28.
SNT.46241.5637	A gunman who walked into the building shot one person dead and wounded five others.
SNT.46241.5638	According to witnesses the man walked up to the building and shot a woman in the leg.
SNT.46241.5639	He entered the building to go onto the roof and fire one shot before walking back inside and firing several more shots.
SNT.46241.5640	After a few minutes the gunman surrendered to police through 911.
SNT.46241.5641	According to Amy Wasser-Simpson, the federation's vice president, the man shouted, "I'm a Muslim American; I'm angry at Israel," before shooting.
SNT.46241.5642	An employee who wished not to be identified spoke of the shots fired, "It went 'Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!' and then we heard a woman scream."
SNT.46241.5643	"One of the receptionists told me that he shot her and then demanded that she call 911."
SNT.46241.5644	"I saw one friend –– she had been shot twice in the stomach and was bleeding,"
SNT.46241.5645	All of the victims were women between 19 and 43.
SNT.46241.5646	They have sustained wounds to the knee, groin, abdomen and arm. 
SNT.46241.5647	 Three of the five have been taken to the operating room, said Pamela Steele, spokeswoman for the Harbourview Medical Center.

SNT.276029.5654	38 people were killed on Saturday when a US Chinook helicopter crashed west of Kabul, Afghanistan, with the Taliban claiming responsibility for the crash.
SNT.276029.5655	Thirty Americans were killed in the crash, including at least seventeen members of SEAL Team 6, Air Force members, the helicopter's crew, a dog handler and a civilian interpreter, while eight members of the Afghan Army were also on board and died.
SNT.276029.5656	According to witnesses, members of the Taliban and officials from the US and Afghanistan, the Chinook was deliberately targeted, apparently by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG).
SNT.276029.5657	While no American officials have spoken on the record about the cause of the crash, anonymous sources have said that the helicopter was shot down, an assertion that corresponds with reports from local officials and witness, who said that the helicopter crashed after a rocket struck it.
SNT.276029.5658	The Taliban said that they had brought the aircraft down while it was involved in an operation targeting a house where insurgents were meeting.
SNT.276029.5659	While Taliban forces do not have a history of shooting down aircraft, they claim to have modified their RPGs for improved accuracy, but there is no proof of this.
SNT.276029.5660	The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, warned against leaping to conclusions, however, saying that "[i]nformation is still coming in about this incident."
SNT.276029.5661	" I think it's important that we allow investigators to do their work before jumping to too many conclusions."
SNT.276029.5662	President Barack Obama issued a statement after the incident, saying that "[t]heir deaths are a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan."
SNT.52541.5663	Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have unveiled a new roadmap for the Northern Ireland devolution process.
SNT.52541.5664	The roadmap sets a target date for a new Northern Ireland Executive to be set up.
SNT.52541.5665	The roadmap, known as the Saint Andrews Agreement, came after three days of intense talks in St. Andrews, Scotland.
SNT.52541.5666	The agreement gives dates for the steps to devolution culminating on March 26, 2007 when the Executive is to be fully up and running.
SNT.52541.5667	The first deadline is on November 10, 2006 during which time both parties must accept the agreement and for the first time in the history of the party, the Democratic Unionist Party will cast a vote for their rivals, Sinn Fein.
SNT.52541.5668	The second deadline is on November 27, 2006 in which the Northern Ireland Assembly, would gather to elect the first minister and deputy first minister of the Executive.
SNT.52541.5669	The first minister is speculated by many to be Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.
SNT.52541.5670	The deputy first minister is speculated to be Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein.
SNT.52541.5671	One of the key issues is Sinn Fein's recognition of the Police Service of Northern Island, which replaced the controverisal Royal Ulster Constabulary.
SNT.52541.5672	In a reassurance to unionists, the governments said they will not transfer duties over to the executive till 2008.
SNT.52541.5673	Sinn Fein demanded an immediate transfer of power, possibly to a Sinn Fein minister.
SNT.52541.5674	"You can't have a democratic society unless the police are given full support," Blair said.
SNT.52541.5675	After the election of ministers, three steps will take place.
SNT.52541.5676	The Democratic Unionists will be given time to observe Sinn Fein and see if they are accepting policing.
SNT.52541.5677	Also, in January, the Independent Monitoring Commission will give another report on the status of the Provisional Irish Republican Army revocation of violence.
SNT.52541.5678	Finally in March, an electoral endorsement of the Saint Andrews Agreement will take place be it either through election or referendum.
SNT.52541.5679	Most of the participants at the summit favored a referendum, except for Ian Paisley, according to an anoynoums source who wished not be identified as he no authorization to release details publicly.
SNT.52541.5680	The last two final steps take place in March 2007.
SNT.52541.5681	On March 14, the nomination of the Executive will take place.
SNT.52541.5682	Finally, if all goes well, the Northern Ireland Executive power-sharing government and full devolved Northern Ireland Assembly would be revived and take power on March 26, 2007.
SNT.52541.5683	However, if the parties fail to set up the Executive or fail to agree "at any stage", the Assembly will be dissolved and direct rule from London will continue with input from the Republic of Ireland.
SNT.52541.5684	Tony Blair said the essential parts of the agreement are that all parties accept policing and the courts and have a clear agreement on power-sharing.
SNT.52541.5685	"So those are the two essential parts of it," Mr Blair said.
SNT.52541.5686	Ian Paisley, the notorious hardliner evangelist who has made his political career out of saying no to comprehensive reforms, eschewed his trademark fire-brand rhetoric offered a welcome and said that the province is "at a crossroads."
SNT.52541.5687	Paisley said of Ulster, "a place where there is a road to democracy and where there is a road to anarchy."
SNT.52541.5688	Further adding, "I trust that we will see in the coming days the vast majority of people taking the road to democracy."
SNT.52541.5689	Blair also added, "We've been through different parts of this process many times over the past few years but I think this is a sound basis to proceed."
SNT.52541.5690	He also said on the possible election of Paisley and McGuinness to their minister positions, "I do not think anybody will find it easy to sit in an executive with people who they are deeply opposed to, or indeed hostile to."
SNT.52541.5691	Referring to Sinn Fein, Paisley stated "We will meet the requirements. "
SNT.52541.5692	"But the IRA-Sinn Fein has got to meet those requirements." 
SNT.52541.5693	"And when they do, we will really be on the way to peace in Northern Ireland."

SNT.52541.5699	He added "Sinn Fein will sign up to the PSNI being the only force of law and order and Ian Paisley, or a colleague, will share the joint office of first and deputy first minister with Martin McGuinness in a mandatory coalition."

SNT.207717.5730	Fud Leclerc, who represented Belgium at the Eurovision Song Contest four times, has died at the age of 86.
SNT.207717.5731	Leclerc had the distinct honour of being the first person to score nul points at the 1962 contest.
SNT.207717.5732	The singer performed at the first contest in 1956 and appeared again two years later and achieved his best result with his performance of Ma petite chatte.
SNT.207717.5733	After appearing for the third time at the 1960 contest he made his final appearance at the 1962 contest.
SNT.207717.5734	At the 1962 contest Leclerc became the first person in Eurovision history to fail to score any points, also known as Nul Points.

SNT.201356.5738	Plastic surgeon to the stars Dr. Frank Ryan has died in a car accident at age 50.
SNT.201356.5739	It is reported that the Jeep Ryan was driving crashed over the side of the Pacific Coast Highway and landed on rocks.
SNT.201356.5740	Lifeguards were first on the scene and unsuccessfully tried to rescue Ryan.
SNT.201356.5741	It is thought that no other vehicle was involved in the incident.
SNT.201356.5742	Dr. Ryan, a celebrity in his own right, performed plastic surgery on several stars including Janice Dickinson, Gene Simmons, Shauna Sand and Adrianne Curry.
SNT.201356.5743	He appeared on several television shows and became one of the first people to perform plastic surgery on television in 1995.
SNT.201356.5744	A representative for Janice Dickinson released a statement about the death of Ryan.
SNT.201356.5745	She said "Janice is deeply, deeply anguished! She is stunned and wants the world to know what a genius Dr. Ryan was."

SNT.5451.5747	The CIA has been secretly authorized by a classified directive, signed by US President Bush, to send suspects overseas as part of a "rendition" process.
SNT.5451.5748	The program has been used to manage the large case load which has accumulated since the September 11, 2001 attacks, leaving US officials free to concentrate on the "high value" suspects who are kept under US control at secret locations throughout the world.
SNT.5451.5749	Today, US officials were reluctant to defend this policy for any specific cases, but White House spokesman Dan Bartlett presented a generic defense of US anti-terrorism policies on Sunday talk shows in the United States.
SNT.5451.5750	A former government official claimed that the program was "fully authorized" and that the CIA was "not doing anything illegal" in an interview with The New York Times, and said that the leadership of the House and Senate intelligence committees was able to find out about the program, or had been informed of its existence.
SNT.5451.5751	Allowing the CIA to have so much power in deciding who can stay in the country and who is shipped off to other countries is controversial, because in the past, the White House, State Department, or Justice Department would have been involved in approving individual cases of sending prisoners to other countries.
SNT.5451.5752	While refusing to admit that the rendition policy even exists, the Bush administration claimed that they do not hand over people to be tortured in other countries, to get around US laws which prohibit such practices.
SNT.5451.5753	However, the New York Times interviewed a number of current and former officials who believed that the policy was designed to allow the government to plausibly deny that torture was being tolerated.
SNT.5451.5754	The case of Australian Mamdouh Habib attracted widespread attention in that country, after he was released in January after 40 months, without any charges being pressed.
SNT.5451.5755	Australian officials were aware that he had been transferred by the United States to Egypt for six months.
SNT.5451.5756	During this time, Habib claims he was subjected to various methods of torture, including electric shock and being held under water.
SNT.5451.5757	The United States denies that Habib was tortured with their knowledge, although US officials were not present during his overseas captivity and could not guarantee that he had not been tortured.
SNT.5451.5758	Egypt has not confirmed that Habib was ever in the country.
SNT.5451.5759	A similar case involving Syrian born Canadian Maher Arar, deported to Syria in October, 2002, subsequently held and allegedly tortured for 374 days, led to Canada issuing a travel advisory strongly cautioning Canadians born in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and Sudan against travel to the United States for any reason.
SNT.5451.5760	A subsequent internal RCMP investigation found several instances of impropriety in the Arar case, including the provision of sensitive information on Arar to US officials, and that a liaison officer may have known of the deportation plan but did not contact his supervisors.
SNT.5451.5761	Mr. Arar's attempt to sue American Attorney-General John Ashcroft over the incident in January 2004 was dismissed when the US government invoked the rarely used "state secrets privilege", claiming that to go forward in open court would jeopardize intelligence, foreign policy, and national security interests.
SNT.5451.5762	Legal analysts point out that information obtained through the use of torture is useless in court proceedings, but US officials insist that the information obtained from such interrogations is still useful for their purposes, and that "it has resulted in the capture of terrorists."
SNT.39540.5763	Eleven protesters, including five members of Congress, were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly.
SNT.39540.5764	"The Sudanese government has shown total disregard for the wishes of the global, civilized community." 
SNT.39540.5765	 " I have no optimism as to the actions of the Sudanese government," Lantos said.
SNT.39540.5766	Democratic House members James McGovern and John Olver of Massachusetts, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, and Jim Moran of Virginia were among the others arrested and released after paying $50 fines after being arrested in front of the Sudanese embassy.
SNT.39540.5767	Olver said, "We must hold the Sudanese government accountable for the attacks they have supported on their own citizens in Darfur."
SNT.39540.5768	Meanwhile, President Bush met with Darfur advocates this Friday in support of rallies all over the US this weekend against the ongoing genocide in western Sudan.
SNT.39540.5769	There will be rallies across our country to send a message to the Sudanese government that the genocide must stop.
SNT.39540.5770	"I want the Sudanese government to understand the United States of America is serious about solving this problem," Bush said.
SNT.392416.5771	Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, the leader of Egypt's Coptic Christian church, has died at the age of 88.

SNT.392416.5777	Shenouda spent 40 years as pope to the Coptics, who make up the majority of the nation's estimated ten million Christians.
SNT.392416.5778	Much of this time was spent pacifying his followers in the wake of violence and perceived discrimination, whilst working with the majority Muslims.
SNT.392416.5779	He spent three years exiled in the cathedral after claims of sectarian troublemaking from then-President in 1981.
SNT.392416.5780	With Mubarak gone, many Copts are concerned that Islamist political parties gaining new influence could mark a time of trouble for their religion.
SNT.392416.5781	"He left us an example of leadership that we should all follow," a cleric told the congregation at the fourth-century cathedral.
SNT.392416.5782	"It is because of him that we have national unity with our Muslim brothers".
SNT.392416.5783	Traffic was congested around the cathedral, which the pope remained fond of, while services were ongoing today.
SNT.392416.5784	Shenouda was dressed in full regalia, complete with a gold crown.
SNT.392416.5785	His body was taken to a military airfield and was to be taken to desert monastery St Bishoy for burial.
SNT.392416.5786	Tributes have been paid to Pope Shenouda as thousands of people mourned his death.
SNT.392416.5787	President of the United States Barack Obama said in a statement "We will remember Pope Shenouda III as a man of deep faith, a leader of a great faith, and an advocate for unity and reconciliation…" 
SNT.392416.5788	"His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together."
SNT.110032.5789	Four bombs blasted at popular seaside resorts in northern Spain on Sunday.
SNT.110032.5790	The blasts were preceded by the warning of the Basque separatist group ETA, which allowed the police to evacuate the nearby area.
SNT.110032.5791	Previously, a first homemade bomb blasted in a bank in the Basque town of Getxo.
SNT.110032.5792	Five hours later, a warning call was received in the Basque fire service telling that four bombs were planted on the beaches of Laredo and Noja, in the northern Spanish province of Cantabria.
SNT.110032.5793	The four bombs exploded between 1100 (1000 GMT) and 1400.
SNT.110032.5794	There were no injuries because the police had evacuated the area.
SNT.110032.5795	ETA has routinely targeted tourist destinations in northern Spain during summer months.
SNT.99000.5796	Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois and 2008 US presidential candidate has swept all three of today's Democratic contests, two caucuses in Nebraska and Washington and the primary in Louisiana.
SNT.99000.5797	Obama also won the tiny United States territory of the United States Virgin Islands.
SNT.99000.5798	Obama won nearly 30% more over opponent Hillary Clinton in the Nebraska caucuses.
SNT.99000.5799	Obama also had a major lead over Clinton in the Washington caucuses by a 2-1 margin.
SNT.99000.5800	Commentators have noted that Obama seems to perform well in caucus states.
SNT.99000.5801	Louisiana's Democratic primary was also won by Obama in a large margin, winning nearly 53% of the vote over Clinton's 39%.
SNT.99000.5802	The state, which is still suffering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina three years later could play a large role in the election this year.
SNT.99000.5803	Despite these wins it is still a close race between the two Democratic candidates, with Obama showing a lead in pledged delegates, and Hillary Clinton showing a narrow lead when super delegates are taken into account.
SNT.99000.5804	Each candidate needs to win the support of 2,025 delegates to secure the nomination.
SNT.99000.5805	After the voting and caucusing ended yesterday both candidates gave a speech at the Democratic Party's Jefferson and Jackson Dinner in Virginia- Clinton giving her standard stump speech and refusing to talk about what had happened during the day; Obama repeating many of the things he had said earlier in his "Yes We Can" speech, this time with detailed policy proposals as well as "hope-mongering".
SNT.99000.5806	The two candidates were in Maine today doing last minute campaigning before tomorrow's Democratic caucuses there and are also preparing for the "Potomac primary" which will involve the nation's capital of Washington, D.C. and the bordering states of Maryland and Virginia to be held on February 12.
SNT.66658.5807	According to BBC News Online more than 300 people were detained and at least 10 hurt after a second night of riots in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.
SNT.66658.5808	Clashes began last night after Estonian authorities removed a controversial Soviet monument, the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, which Russian-speaking Estonians see as a symbol of the liberation of Eastern Europe from Nazism, while Estonian nationalists view it as a reminder of Soviet occupation.
SNT.200209.5809	A family of six were injured at Flat Rock Bridge Family Resort and campground in Lebanon, Maine after a severe thunderstorm caused trees to topple, with one landing on a tent.
SNT.200209.5810	A 10-year-old girl was critically injured after a tree fell on the tent she was sleeping in.
SNT.200209.5811	Witnesses say the girl was pinned under the tree for at least 10 minutes before they were able to remove it.
SNT.200209.5812	Witnesses also say the day was beautiful and sunny, but at around 6:00 p.m. (EDT) a storm rolled in, darkening the sky, followed by heavy winds and rain.
SNT.200209.5813	Witnesses describe a "funnel-like wind" which lifted items off the ground and threw them around.
SNT.200209.5814	The strong winds then brought down trees and limbs, with one landing on the family's campsite and tent.
SNT.200209.5815	"The female patient was loaded into Lebanon Ambulance One and transported to Frisbie Hospital in Rochester to be stabilized and then was transferred to the trauma center at Maine Medical Center." 
SNT.200209.5816	 "Her injuries were considered critical and life threatening when she left the scene," said Jason Cole, the assistant rescue chief for the area.
SNT.200209.5817	The victims names have not been released and the girl's current condition is not yet known.
SNT.200209.5818	Rescuers responding to the scene noticed several other trees and limbs scattered around other campsites and searched all 350 sites, but no other injuries were reported.
SNT.200209.5819	Other campers say they had several close calls with tree limbs and debris.
SNT.200209.5820	At least 12 trees were reported to have toppled during the storm.
SNT.200209.5821	The family's car was also destroyed when a tree limb landed on it.
SNT.200209.5822	The National Weather Service in Maine says it will investigate whether or not the storm produced a tornado.
SNT.77848.5823	Citizens in the Australian city of Bathurst in Central-Western New South Wales have turned out in the hundreds on top of Mount Panorama to observe tonight's lunar eclipse.
SNT.77848.5824	Those who turned out for the spectacle were treated to live music and purple flags with lighting to take on a mystic theme.
SNT.77848.5825	Mount Panorama provided perfect conditions for the show, with minimal light and clear skies.
SNT.77848.5826	Just before 7 p.m. AEST the eclipse began to be visible with the Earth beginning to shadow the Moon, by 8:37 p.m. AEST the top of Mount Panorama was bathed in an eerie red glow as the moon glowed deep red.
SNT.77848.5827	Michael Stanton, a local astronomy fan told Wikinews "this is just great, we have music and this visual delight to see".
SNT.115154.5828	The UK Government has stated that children in Britain will no longer be required to take compulsory, externally marked tests at the age of fourteen.
SNT.115154.5829	The change takes effect immediately, meaning that children who were due to take the test this year no longer have to do so.
SNT.115154.5830	Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families Ed Balls yesterday announced his plans to radically change the UK testing system yesterday, in parliament.
SNT.115154.5831	Currently, almost ten million tests are sat each year by British pupils.
SNT.115154.5832	This change is expected to cut the number of tests taken in half, according to The Guardian.
SNT.115154.5833	The tests for seven and eleven year olds are not being abolished.
SNT.115154.5834	A review group is being set up, however, to research the effect of these tests on eleven-year-olds.
SNT.115154.5835	Instead of league tables showing test results, the government will produce report cards for secondary schools.
SNT.115154.5836	According to Ed Balls, the results from GCSEs will be adequate to judge the performance of schools by their test results.
SNT.115154.5837	The decision to abolish the tests for fourteen year olds came as a result of a situation earlier this year, when there were long delays with the delivery of test results to students of this age.
SNT.115154.5838	According to Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the government is admitting that the previous test system failed by making this move.
SNT.115154.5839	"For too long English, mathematics and science teachers in secondary schools have found themselves skewing everything to enable their pupils to jump through a series of unnecessary hoops," she claimed, while Chris Keates, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said that "the sound of a deep collective sigh of relief will emanate from secondary schools across the country."
SNT.115154.5840	Conservative Shadow Secretary of State for Children Michael Gove stated that his party have "argued for fewer national tests and more rigor and we want to work constructively to improve the assessment and qualifications regime."
SNT.115154.5841	David Laws, Shadow Secretary of State for Children for the Liberal Democrats, said that "the Sats tests taken by 14-year-olds are not only a waste of time but have been highly unreliable over the last few years."
SNT.16450.5842	The Italian football team Inter Milan have cancelled their tour of England, where they were to play the English teams Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Portsmouth, and Norwich City.
SNT.16450.5843	The four matches were due to take place between 25 July and 31 July.
SNT.16450.5844	The cancellation of the tour has come days after a failed bomb attack on London.
SNT.16450.5845	Only one match — the game against Crystal Palace — was to have been played in London.
SNT.16450.5846	Inter Milan confirmed in a statement that the attacks on London compelled the club to cancel their tour of England, saying that: "Football takes a step back because of increasing serious events which touch the sensitivity of everyone."
SNT.16450.5847	 "For this reason, and given the situation, the club has decided to cancel the team's tour of England."
SNT.63563.5848	Premier Jean Charest, 48, won a close race for his seat in Sherbrooke, despite having already been declared defeated by a PQ candidate.
SNT.63563.5849	Quebec's chief electoral officer telephoned the premier to relay the news that he had retained his seat.
SNT.63563.5850	CBC's French language network Télévision de Radio-Canada indicated the initial results were erroneous.
SNT.63563.5851	The ADQ have won well over the seats needed for them to have official party status.
SNT.63563.5852	In the 2003 Quebec election they won a total of 4 seats, and would have needed 8 more seats to obtain party status.
SNT.63563.5853	In the 2003 election, the ADQ garnered 21% of the vote.
SNT.63563.5854	If the results of the 2007 election holds, with 31% of the vote for the ADQ, it would represent a significant gain for the party.
SNT.63563.5855	The Liberal campaign, under Charest's leadership, stumbled in the latter stages of the campaign when Charest allotted a $700 million windfall, in the form of a transfer from the federal Conservative government, to tax cuts for Quebecers.
SNT.63563.5856	The move to apply the money so quickly to tax cuts during the campaign, resonated with some as a cynical move to buy votes, and may have harmed the Liberal chances.
SNT.63563.5857	This is the first minority government in Quebec in more than 100 years since the year 1878.
SNT.63563.5858	Compared to the 2003 election, voter turnout is up by approximately 3%, according to Elections Quebec.

SNT.174636.5860	At 8:50 AM local time (15:50 UTC) a man attempting to enter the United States at the Tijuana – San Diego section of the US – Mexican border, tried to escape U.S. customs officers, after he could not provide official documentation.
SNT.174636.5861	According to Lieutenant Kevin Rooney of the San Diego police department, "the agent referred the driver to a secondary inspection and he [the driver] quickly accelerated away."
SNT.174636.5862	The acceleration caused him to crash into a pickup truck.
SNT.174636.5863	It is thought he was trying to force the other vehicle out of the way.
SNT.174636.5864	When customs officers surrounded the vehicle, the driver went into reverse, which led to two officers opening fire on the vehicle.
SNT.174636.5865	The man was shot only once and the wound was not life threatening.
SNT.174636.5866	Police officials believe the driver tried to flee because the vehicle was reported to have been stolen from Colorado.
SNT.139681.5867	NASA's Cassini orbiter has sent back remarkable images from Saturn, revealing that the planet's famous rings are far more bumpy than expected.
SNT.139681.5868	Astronomers previously thought that the rings were almost completely flat, with changes in height of only a few metres.
SNT.139681.5869	However analysis of the new images show ridges up to 4 kilometres tall, similar in height to the Rocky Mountains or the Alps.
SNT.139681.5870	The images were taken around the planet's equinox on August 11, when the Sun was directly over Saturn's equator and caught the rings edge on.
SNT.139681.5871	But whilst equinoxes occur twice a year on Earth, Saturn takes around 29.7 Earth years to orbit the Sun so the events are much rarer.
SNT.139681.5872	With the light from the Sun reaching Saturn's rings at such a low angle, scientists were able to measure the shadows cast by bumps on the rings and discover their surprising height.
SNT.139681.5873	As Cassini project scientist Bob Pappalardo put it: "It's like putting on 3-D glasses and seeing the third dimension for the first time."
SNT.139681.5874	"This is among the most important events Cassini has shown us."
SNT.139681.5875	Some of the ring features are known to be caused by Saturn's moons, but others are harder to explain.
SNT.139681.5876	"To understand what we are seeing will take more time, but the images and data will help develop a more complete understanding of how old the rings might be and how they are evolving," said Linda Spilker, Cassini deputy project scientist.
SNT.139681.5877	Cassini was launched in 1997, and entered orbit around Saturn in 2004.
SNT.139681.5878	It is part of the Cassini-Huygens joint mission between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.
SNT.149987.5879	Ballots are being counted in Sri Lanka, after a presidential election was held there, the first after the Tamil Tiger rebels were defeated during a 25-year-long civil war.
SNT.149987.5880	The incumbent president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, is expected to be in a close race against former army chief, General Sarath Fonseka; both candidates say they expect to win.
SNT.149987.5881	There are twenty other candidates on the ballot, but none of them are expected to win.
SNT.149987.5882	Polls closed at 16.00 local time, or 10.30 GMT on Tuesday.
SNT.149987.5883	There were claims of voter intimidation and sporadic acts of violence, and the BBC reports that there were some small bomb blasts.
SNT.149987.5884	The independent operating organisation Centre for Monitoring Election Violence said it had confirmed close to a hundred violent incidents during the day, adding that it believes the number could rise to 150.
SNT.149987.5885	Polls were reportedly busy, with stations in the capital of Colombo being filled with lines of people half an hour before polls officially opened at 07.00 (01.30 UTC).
SNT.149987.5886	"I have been voting at this booth for over 20 years but never saw a crowd like this," said businessman Mohamed Sallel, who had voted in the Borella district of the capital, as quoted by The Telegraph.
SNT.149987.5887	Another voter, Doctor Nimalka Perera, gave an account of the crowds: "When I first came here, the queue was too long so I went back and came two hours later on my way to the hospital and found the line even longer."
SNT.149987.5888	President Rajapakse, after voting in his home constituency, addressed reporters.
SNT.149987.5889	"We must be ready to face the challenges of reaching new heights after this vote," he said.
SNT.149987.5890	Fonseka, however, wasn't able to cast a ballot, apparently because his name didn't appear on the 2008 electroral register used for the elections.
SNT.149987.5891	"My name is not on the 2008 register and therefore I cannot vote at this election." 
SNT.149987.5892	 "The government is trying to use this to mislead the public at the last minute," Fonseka stated, saying that he had filled out his voter registration forms.
SNT.149987.5893	Foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama, as well as other politicians from the ruling party, suggested that Fonseka might be disqualified from the elections.
SNT.149987.5894	"We are seeking a court order on the suitability of this candidate because he is not eligible to be declared as a candidate," Bogollagama said, adding that the government wanted a ruling from the courts.
SNT.149987.5895	Independent elections commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake, however, remarked: "Not having one's name on the electoral list is not a disqualification."
SNT.149987.5896	The country's electoral rules state that if neither candidate is able to obtain half of the ballots cast in the first count, then voters' second preferences are to be used to determine the winner.
SNT.149987.5897	Political observers commented that election was too close to call between the two.
SNT.355176.5898	Susan G. Komen for the Cure has stopped funding breast cancer screening and educational programming on breast health run by fellow US-charity Planned Parenthood and its affiliates.
SNT.355176.5899	The Komen institute cites an ongoing investigation, while Planned Parenthood blame political pressures.
SNT.355176.5900	Planned Parenthood received nearly 700,000 from the Komen Foundation last year alone.
SNT.355176.5901	In the last five years, the funding from the foundation has granted 170,000 women breast exams.
SNT.355176.5902	Leslie Aun, a spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, said the organization adopted a new rule that does not allow grants or funding to be awarded to organizations that are under legal investigation.
SNT.355176.5903	Komen's policy disqualified Planned Parenthood due to a pending investigation on how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money that is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns.
SNT.355176.5904	Stearns is investigating whether taxes are used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood in his role as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which is under the umbrella of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
SNT.355176.5905	"While it is regrettable when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such as a longstanding partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most fully advance our mission," Aun said.
SNT.355176.5906	Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, said, "While this is deeply disturbing and disappointing, we want to assure women who rely on Planned Parenthood for breast care that we're still here for them, and we always will be. "
SNT.355176.5907	The new fund we're launching to support these services will ensure that the Komen Foundation's decision doesn't jeopardize women's health."
SNT.87137.5908	Global warming campaigner and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore says it is time for humanity to stop "waging war" on planet Earth.
SNT.87137.5909	Gore spoke today in Oslo after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.
SNT.87137.5910	He urged the two largest carbon-emitting countries - the United States and China - to make what he called the "boldest moves" to fight global warming.
SNT.87137.5911	The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 international pact that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
SNT.87137.5912	China was not required to reduce emissions under the deal.
SNT.87137.5913	They also refused today to approve a new treaty designed to cut emissions by 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020.
SNT.87137.5914	Gore said he would go to the U.N. climate meeting in Bali later this week to urge world leaders to meet as often as every three months to enact a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.
SNT.87137.5915	Gore shared the 2007 Nobel prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, represented at today's ceremony by Rajendra Pachauri.
SNT.87137.5916	Pachauri stressed the link between the fight against climate change and peace.
SNT.87137.5917	He warned that severe climate change will trigger what he called "dramatic population migration," as well as war over water and other resources.
SNT.87137.5918	He also warned that up to 250 million people in Africa could face what he called "increased water stress because of climate change."
SNT.116618.5919	India's first lunar mission, the Chandrayaan-1 (meaning 'moon craft' in Sanskrit), reached its destined lunar orbit on Wednesday.
SNT.116618.5920	It is now in a circular orbit 102 kilometres from the Moon.
SNT.116618.5921	It will stay in this orbit for two years and conduct various experiments to gain a better understanding of the Moon.
SNT.116618.5922	According to Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) officials, the Moon Impact Probe (MIP), with an Indian flag painted on it, will be dropped late tonight.
SNT.116618.5923	The MIP has a mass of 29 kg and it will take 20 minutes to reach the moon's surface.
SNT.36853.5924	Two explosions were heard in the city of La Paz, Bolivia on Tuesday night, March 22 and in the early morning Wednesday, March 23.
SNT.36853.5925	The first occurred at the Linares Motel, at 21:50 (01:50 UTC), and left two people dead and four injured.
SNT.36853.5926	The second explosion occurred at 01:45 (05:45 UTC) at the Hotel Riosinhio II, less than a block from the La Paz bus terminal, injuring two people.
SNT.36853.5927	Hours later, two suspects in the crime were arrested by the police in the city of El Alto.
SNT.36853.5928	They were American Claudio Lestat, approximately 30 years old (25 according to some sources) and his partner, Uruguayan Alda Ribeiros, of 35 years (40 according to other sources).
SNT.36853.5929	Dynamite was used in both explosions, according to government attorney Jorge Gutiérrez.
SNT.36853.5930	President Evo Morales indicated that the promoters of the incidents were "industrialists" and "oligarchists" who, "using external agents", claimed to halt the reforms that have been happening in Bolivia.
SNT.36853.5931	He also suggested that the United States could be behind the incidents: "Is there an effort against terrorism from the government of the United States, or did they send North Americans to commit terrorism in Bolivia?" Despite the accusations, the United States embassy in La Paz announced its cooperation.
SNT.36853.5932	However, authorities have not ruled out religious motives, because Lestat is a self-proclaimed "minister of pagan rites".
SNT.36853.5933	Police also announced that the Chilean consulate in the Bolivian capital was also a target, to be attacked on Saturday the 25th.
SNT.13337.5934	The United States House of Representatives on June 29 passed a $1.17 billion funding bill for Amtrak in fiscal year 2006, an amount that is still short of the $2 billion Amtrak was originally seeking.
SNT.13337.5935	The funding was approved in an amendment to a more general transportation and treasury appropriations bill.
SNT.13337.5936	The House also removed the requirement in the bill that would mandate Amtrak to end passenger train service on currently unprofitable routes.
SNT.13337.5937	The funding has yet to be approved by the Senate.
SNT.9257.5938	The People's Republic of China (PRC) in recent years has begun an effort to reform its judicial system and make trials more fair and accountable, according to its state-run People's Daily.
SNT.9257.5939	Those efforts came to a head today with the official May 1 start of jury duty by more than 27,000 newly qualified jurors.
SNT.9257.5940	According to People's Daily, "It is the first time in Chinese history that the people's juries are appointed in a uniformed way by the people's congresses at all levels."
SNT.9257.5941	Two jurors and a judge will be sitting on each three-person panel, and decide both criminal and civil cases.
SNT.9257.5942	The juries will be available when requested by litigants and also in cases "with considerable social repercussions", which appears to mean major cases.
SNT.9257.5943	The jurors are not chosen for each trial but will serve a five-year term in the jury pool working on different cases from time to time.
SNT.9257.5944	Jurors have been provided for in the Chinese Constitution since 1954, but their role in the system was not well-defined by law until now.
SNT.9257.5945	The changes to the jury system are part of a long-term planned reform of China's judicial system that was announced in 1999 by China's top judge, Xiao Yang.
SNT.9257.5946	In addition to jury reforms, the plan addressed trial procedures and court structure and supervision.
SNT.9257.5947	The goal was to "perfect the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics...in accordance with the Constitution and laws, and [without] judicial independence and supremacy, which exist in many Western countries," according to Xiao Yang as reported by the People's Daily in 1999.
SNT.9257.5948	"Court reform represents a major part of China's reform of the judicial system and political restructuring." 
SNT.9257.5949	The essence of judicial reform is judicial fairness, which is crucial to the country's rule of law," Xiao Yang said back then.
SNT.9257.5950	In August 2004, the 10th National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee approved a "resolution on improving the people's jury system", which took effect today.
SNT.9257.5951	The system specifies that either by recommendation of local work units or by self-application, potential jurors can take qualifying examinations and be presented to standing committees of the NPC for appointment as jurors.
SNT.9257.5952	The first batch of 1,342 jurors were tested in Beijing under the new law on April 23, 2005.
SNT.9257.5953	Those who were certified to begin service on May 1 are said to "participate in all hearing activities of people's courts according to the law, enjoying the same rights as do the judges except that for a presiding judge after their assumption of the post," according to the People's Daily.
SNT.9257.5954	This is an important move to upgrade and strengthen the system of people's jurors, Xiao Long of Beijing People's Court said to China Daily on April 24.
SNT.9257.5955	The implementation of the NPC's decision will add more transparency and justness to the country's judicial system, he added.
SNT.9257.5956	China has one of the world's largest prison systems with over 1 million prisoners, similar to Russia.
SNT.9257.5957	It has received criticism over the years from the U.S. State Department and others for its arbitrariness and its treatment of political prisoners.
SNT.9257.5958	The United States, however, is the world's largest jailer, with a staggering 2 million prison inmates, out of 9 million total around the entire globe.
SNT.110217.5959	A wax model of British singer Amy Winehouse was unveiled on Wednesday at Madame Tussauds in London.
SNT.110217.5960	The model, nearly six feet tall and clad in a yellow dress with a microphone in hand, is said to bear a strong likeness to the singer.
SNT.110217.5961	Her tattoos have even been reproduced to the last detail, including one of a lightning bolt.
SNT.110217.5962	While her parents attended the event, Winehouse herself was too busy working to attend.
SNT.110217.5963	Her father Mitch remarked that "This is the reward for her musical achievements and her talent".
SNT.110217.5964	The troubled singer, 24, is well known for her drug use, and last month was thought to have been suffering from the early stages of emphysema.
SNT.120428.5965	The newly formed Icelandic coalition interim government will take office today, according to a coalition leader.
SNT.120428.5966	On January 27, it was announced that the nation's coalition government had collapsed and dissolved following a banking financial crisis.
SNT.120428.5967	In October of 2008, Iceland's banking sector collapsed and was largely nationalised.
SNT.120428.5968	Iceland's interest rate is now 18%, with GDP expected to fall 9.6% this year.
SNT.120428.5969	Just before the announcement of the government taking office, nearly 1,500 people were protesting outside the parliament building over the collapsed government and the recent financial crisis, but protesters seemed happy about the change.
SNT.120428.5970	Therefore "today is a celebration," said protest organizer Hordur Torfason to the crowd who were cheering about hearing the news.
SNT.120428.5971	The new minority coalition will consist of Jóhanna's Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement with backing from the Progressive Party.
SNT.120428.5972	He criticizes her appointment because he believes she will not help the economic crisis, resulting in more government spending.
SNT.120428.5973	The quick appointment of the new government also means an early election, which is scheduled to take place on April 25.
SNT.58176.5974	According to a press release today from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, there are seven films in contention for the "Academy Award for Makeup".
SNT.58176.5975	Ten minutes of each film will be screened for the Academy's Makeup Award Nominating Committee on Saturday, January 20, 2006.
SNT.58176.5976	The committee will decide which of the three films should receive nominations.
SNT.58176.5977	This list will then be voted on by the entire Academy.
SNT.58176.5978	The 79th Academy Awards will honor the outstanding film achievements of 2006.
SNT.58176.5979	The ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, February 25, 2007, at the Kodak Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center.
SNT.66252.5980	Abdullah Gül, current deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Turkey, has been named as the new presidential candidate by his party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP).
SNT.66252.5981	In Turkey, the parliament votes to elect the new President of Turkey.
SNT.66252.5982	The AKP has 353 of the 550 seats in Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
SNT.66252.5983	While Gül may not get elected in the first or second round, when a two-thirds majority is needed, their votes are enough to elect the new president at the third or fourth rounds of the election process, when a simple majority is needed.
SNT.66252.5984	The main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), hinted that it may nominate its own candidate to challenge Gül.
SNT.58456.5985	A British church group has defended a city mosque accused of "extremism", following an investigation by Channel 4 television.
SNT.58456.5986	The Saltley Gate Peace Group, an interfaith organisation based in Birmingham, has expressed "its undiminished support" for the Green Lane Masjid, featured in Channel 4's investigative Dispatches programme shown on Monday 15 January.
SNT.58456.5987	While filming Undercover Mosque, a secret Dispatches reporter attended lectures at mosques run by key organisations whose public faces are presented as "moderate and mainstream" - but is believed to discover "preachers condemning the idea of integration into British society".
SNT.58456.5988	The apparent influence of "Saudi Arabian Islam", sometimes known as Wahabism or Salafism, is also scrutinised in the film.
SNT.58456.5989	Programme makers claim the documentary, filmed and written by journalist Bobby Pathak, reveals "a number of mosques run by high profile national organisations that claim to be dedicated to moderation and dialogue with other faiths" but are in fact spreading "a message of religious bigotry and extremism".
SNT.58456.5990	One of the Islamic organisations allegedly secretly filmed is Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, a registered British charity which runs more than 40 mosques and branches in the UK with its headquarters at Green Lane Mosque in the Small Heath area of the city.
SNT.58456.5991	It is deeply alarming that a few sentences have been taken out of context in order to create the impression that our institution is a hotbed of fanaticism they could have approached us directly - we operate an open door policy in our mosques.
SNT.58456.5992	The mosque explained, "We would like to make it clear that Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith cannot be regarded as endorsing every word uttered by every speaker we invite to our various mosques.」
SNT.58456.5993	Islam commands us to respond in kind to those who desire peaceful co-existence.
SNT.58456.5994	"If anyone contradicts this teaching then we would repudiate their views without hesitation."
SNT.58456.5995	A similar opinion was echoed in a statement from the Saltley Gate Peace Group.
SNT.58456.5996	The community action project, based at the Saltley Methodist Church, feared the community around the mosque would be ostracized as a result of the investigation.
SNT.58456.5997	"We cannot speak for the views of specific individuals featured in the film but are completely in support of the good nature of the mosque's diverse, multiracial and peaceful worshippers and administration."
SNT.58456.5998	"It is our hope that more resources will be spent on preventing true radical groups from brainwashing young Muslims and less time spent on demonising the general Muslim population for the actions of a select few," they added.
SNT.58456.5999	The religious authority has sent a letter to producer of the programme, Andrew Smith, highlighting their concerns.
SNT.119307.6000	Israel's Central Election Committee voted yesterday to disqualify two Arab political parties from running in the country's general elections scheduled for February 10th.
SNT.119307.6001	Tibi condemned the ruling saying, "It was a political trial led by a group of fascists and racists who are willing to see the Knesset without Arabs and want to see the country without Arabs."
SNT.119307.6002	Arabs constitute one fifth of the population in Israel but only have twelve of 120 parliamentary seats.
SNT.119307.6003	Other parties associated with the Arab-Israeli minority, such as Hadash, are not affected by the committee's decision.
SNT.119307.6004	Israel's High Court of Justice reversed a similar attempt to ban Balad in 2003, and has until Friday to rule on yesterday's votes.
SNT.131892.6005	Wildfires in California continued to spread on Tuesday, having burned more than 140,000 acres of land throughout the state and caused an estimated US$13 million worth of damage.
SNT.131892.6006	The blaze started burning last Wednesday north of Los Angeles.
SNT.131892.6007	Emergency crews said they were hopeful that they would be able to control the fire.
SNT.131892.6008	Currently, twenty-two percent of the blaze is contained, rising from only five percent as little as a day ago.
SNT.131892.6009	Changing weather conditions also helped firefighting efforts, as temperature in the area fell to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, down from over a hundred degrees on Monday.
SNT.131892.6010	"I'm feeling a lot more optimistic today than I did yesterday." 
SNT.131892.6011	 "The crews are doing fabulous work out there on the ground, but the bottom line is that they're fighting for every foot," Dietrich said on Tuesday.
SNT.131892.6012	In a statement, Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that "[his administration] is working around the clock to ensure that our brave men and women working on the fires front lines have the resources needed to respond and beat back these fires as quickly as possible."
SNT.131892.6013	"We have the toughest and best-trained firefighters in the world fighting to protect public safety and property." 
SNT.131892.6014	 "I am confident in the state's response as these fires continue to burn throughout California," he said.
SNT.131892.6015	Two firefighters were killed in the blaze on Sunday, after fires burnt their vehicle on front lines.
SNT.131892.6016	Over 10,000 residents have evacuated areas threatened by the flames.
SNT.139760.6017	Pope Benedict XVI has announced that he will be coming to the United Kingdom in January 2010.
SNT.139760.6018	The information was announced that the Pope had accepted an invitation to visit the United Kingdom from Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
SNT.139760.6019	The latter had visited the Vatican City three times and had invited the Pope to come to Great Britain in February 2009.
SNT.139760.6020	Downing Street is expected to confirm the arrangements later today.
SNT.139760.6021	This visit would make the first Papal visit to the UK since Pope John Paul II's visit in 1982.
SNT.139760.6022	However, John Paul's visit was on a pastoral basis, so this is set to be the first state visit to the UK by a pope in that it is the first to follow an official invitation.
SNT.139760.6023	John Paul's six-day tour through England, Scotland and Wales was hugely popular, attracting hundreds of thousands of people from the Catholic religion.
SNT.139760.6024	It became the first ever UK visit from the Pope, which will make Pope Benedict's visit the second papal one.
SNT.139760.6025	John Paul's visit was likely to be cancelled due to the Falklands War and assasination attempts.
SNT.42578.6026	Alabama Gov. Bob Riley beat back a Republican primary challenge from Roy Moore, the former judge who tried to put up a Ten Commandments monument in his courthouse.
SNT.42578.6027	In the weeks leading to Alabama's gubernatorial primaries, polls showed Riley had pulled ahead of Moore, the former state chief justice who became a hero to the religious right in 2003 when he was ousted over his refusal to remove a 5,300-pound Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building.
SNT.42578.6028	Moore conceded in his hometown of Gadsden, telling supporters, "God's will has been done."
SNT.14592.6029	Gale force winds ripped through Sydney and the South Coast of New South Wales late on Saturday night, causing widespread damage and extensive power outages, with up to 30,000 homes going without electricity at one point.
SNT.14592.6030	The strong winds caused trees to be uprooted, in one instance crashing down upon an unsuspecting motorist, killing a man in his 60's and severely injuring his wife.
SNT.14592.6031	The State Emergency Service (SES) has responded to over 800 calls for help to repair damage caused by the storms, however the storms have subsided somewhat and flood warnings around Bega and Moruya have been withdrawn.
SNT.80486.6032	The Los Angeles City Attorney's Office said yesterday that pop music super-star Britney Spears was facing charges for a hit and run offence and driving without a valid drivers' license.
SNT.80486.6033	Charges were filed following an accident in which police allege Spears smashed her car into another vehicle in a parking area in August of 2007.
SNT.80486.6034	She could face a maximum of six months in jail and US$2,000 in fines if convicted.
SNT.80486.6035	A group of paparazzi recorded a video Britney steering her car into another vehicle on August 6 as she tried to pull into a parking spot in a Studio City lot.
SNT.80486.6036	Kim Robard-Rifkin was the owner of the other car and she filed a police report three days after the accident.
SNT.80486.6037	The 59-year-old nurse found out that it was Spears who ran into her car after watching a video on a celebrity website.
SNT.80486.6038	Robard-Rifkin said, "I simply want my car fixed, the same as I would fix somebody's car if I had done that."
SNT.17627.6039	The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deploying its new Homeland Security Information Network - Secret (HSIN-Secret) in all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites.
SNT.17627.6040	The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials.
SNT.17627.6041	Development on this $350 million system by Northrop Grumman Corporation was begun in March of 2004 with basic operation achieved in just 4 months.
SNT.17627.6042	"The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure," said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in DHS's February 24, 2004 press release that launched the program.
SNT.17627.6043	Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector.
SNT.17627.6044	With the "Secret" component in place, classified information can now be disseminated to authorized individuals at all levels of government and business throughout the country almost instantly.
SNT.17627.6045	HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention.
SNT.17627.6046	Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS.
SNT.190865.6047	The great-granddaughter of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela has died in a car crash following a concert to open the World Cup.
SNT.190865.6048	The Nelson Mandela Foundation released a statement which said that thirteen-year-old Zenani Mandela, who celebrated her birthday on June 9, died in a single vehicle accident and that no one else was injured.
SNT.190865.6049	The statement continued: "The family has asked for privacy as they mourn this tragedy."
SNT.190865.6050	The driver of the vehicle of which Zenani Mandela was a passenger has been arrested and charged with drunk driving.
SNT.190865.6051	He may also face culpable homicide charges, according to police.
SNT.190865.6052	South Africa has a poor road safety record and ranks ninth in the world for traffic fatalities.

SNT.116244.6054	American author and producer Michael Crichton has died in Los Angeles, California at the age of 66, according to a statement released by his family.
SNT.116244.6055	According to Entertainment Tonight, Crichton died after a long and quiet battle with cancer.
SNT.116244.6056	While the world knew him as a great storyteller that challenged our preconceived notions about the world around us — and entertained us all while doing so — his wife Sherri, daughter Taylor, family and friends knew Michael Crichton as a devoted husband, loving father and generous friend who inspired each of us to strive to see the wonders of our world through new eyes, said a statement by his family.
SNT.116244.6057	Crichton, who was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1942, was most famous for the writing of his Jurassic Park novels.
SNT.116244.6058	He also published The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Rising Sun, Timeline, Eaters of the Dead, all of which became major motion pictures.
SNT.116244.6059	He also created, and was an active executive producer of the hit television show ER.
SNT.160772.6060	The Singapore Navy on Thursday warned of a possible pirate threat to ships passing through the Strait of Malacca after receiving a correspondence from an unnamed terrorist organization.
SNT.160772.6061	According to the Navy, the intent of the terrorists was to "achieve widespread publicity and showcase that they remain a viable group."
SNT.160772.6062	While the threat received covered only oil tankers, other large cargo ships were also at risk of attack, naval officials went on to say.
SNT.160772.6063	To reduce possible risks, the Navy urged ships to strengthen onboard security, including adding additional lights and lookouts.
SNT.160772.6064	They also recommended that ships maintain a higher speed and report any unusual incidents to the proper authorities.
SNT.160772.6065	The advisory said that past attacks in the Strait had been carried out by small vessels such as motorboats or fishing boats with armed crews.
SNT.160772.6066	Commercial vessels were also warned to avoid known fishing areas accordingly.
SNT.160772.6067	The Singapore Navy said that it had contacted other countries in the area to warn them of the threat.
SNT.160772.6068	Both Indonesia and Malaysia have also announced plans to increase patrols in order to provide additional security.
SNT.160772.6069	The Strait of Malacca is a major conduit for oil shipments.
SNT.160772.6070	With around a third of global oil shipments passing through, it is the main route for travelling from the Middle East to Asia.
SNT.160772.6071	Any attack on vessels within the Strait would likely have a major ripple effect on global trade.
SNT.143702.6072	Pakistan's military has said that its soldiers killed twelve militants in recent operations targeting Taliban insurgents in South Waziristan.
SNT.143702.6073	The military said security forces battled militants on Friday as they fought for control of Makeen, an area considered the main base of the Pakistani Taliban.
SNT.143702.6074	The military statement also says troops battled to tighten their control over Sararogha, which is another Taliban stronghold.
SNT.143702.6075	The accounts of the Pakistan army's offensive in the tribal region near the Afghan border are difficult to verify, as journalists and aid workers are not allowed into the battle zone.
SNT.143702.6076	Pakistan launched an offensive against the Taliban last month in South Waziristan, an area that is believed to be a stronghold for rebels, and where the government does not have much influence.
SNT.143702.6077	According to the Pakistani army, hundreds of militants were killed since the operation was launched, but the Taliban denies the claims.
SNT.108725.6078	A year since taking up residence at No. 10 Downing street, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his Labour Party is already in trouble after losing a local election, finishing fifth after previously win-less political parties and popularity rating at an all time low.
SNT.108725.6079	Health Minister Ben Bradshaw described the party's loss to the British National Party and to the Greens as a, "terrible loss" and blamed the economic conditions such as rising food and fuel costs as factors that dampens the Labour Party's appeal with the public.
SNT.108725.6080	Conservative Party leader David Cameron countered Bradshaw's opinion by saying, Mr. Brown was to blame for the economic distress.
SNT.108725.6081	Cameron cited the Prime Minister's ten years of handling the economy as minister prior to assuming office when Tony Blair stepped down last year.
SNT.108725.6082	The by-elections in Henley were won by Tory John Howell with a majority of over 10,000 votes, defeating by a large margin the Liberal Democrats who were presumed to have a close edge of beating both Conservatives and Labour.
SNT.108725.6083	Labour threw in their support with Richard McKenzie who only garnered 3% of the votes behind the BNP and Greens.
SNT.108725.6084	Henley called for an election when its representative Boris Johnson was elected Lord Mayor of the City of London.
SNT.28035.6085	The Australian Labor Party has appointed SLW Group to run it's advertisement campaign for the 2007 Australian Legislative Election.
SNT.28035.6086	SLW Group was successul in gaining the $10 million account it was revealed today.
SNT.28035.6087	The team dubbed "07" will be lead by senior executives, Luke Dunkerley and Neil Lawrence.
SNT.28035.6088	ALP campaign director Tim Gartell said that Lawrence had a wealth of experience with political campaigns, being part of the adveritsement team responsible for the election of a Victorian Labor government in the 1980s.
SNT.28035.6089	He also added that Lawrence had worked on the campaign for election of Australian Republican Movement representatives to the Australian Constitutional Convention in 1998.
SNT.28035.6090	Present polling data from Newspoll suggests that the ALP is beginning to regain support in the electorate, narrowly polling a higher percentage of primary support since late October, 2005, ending almost 10 months of being behind John Howard's coalition government in polling.
SNT.31754.6091	A passenger train carrying at least 250 people, many of whom were children, derailed in Serbia-Montenegro and drove into a ravine Tuesday afternoon.
SNT.31754.6092	Close to 200 have been injured and the death toll has risen to 44.
SNT.31754.6093	Most of the passengers were schoolchildren returning from a ski trip.
SNT.31754.6094	"The accident occurred because of a failure of the train's braking system," said Interior Minister Jusuf Kalomperovic.
SNT.31754.6095	At about 4 p.m. the four-car train derailed near Bioče, a small village nearly 15 kilometers northeast of Podgorica as it was emerging from a tunnel above the Moraca River.
SNT.31754.6096	"The train simply went wild, out of control," said one injured passenger.
SNT.31754.6097	"I was fine because I was in a back compartment, those in the front got the worst of it."
SNT.31754.6098	"It was horrible, I saw many dead and wounded around me," said another passenger from Hungary, Karman Chofu.
SNT.31754.6099	"I had fallen asleep when a loud noise woke me," said Stanislava Bukovic, 60, another injured passenger.
SNT.31754.6100	Miodrag Djurovic, the head of the main Podgorica hospital, stated that another five passengers had died overnight.
SNT.31754.6101	Djurovic also said at least 198 people, 90 of them children, have been treated at the hospital.
SNT.31754.6102	"The children's hospital admitted 90 children, 34 of them are still there, six have undergone surgery," Djurovic said.
SNT.31754.6103	Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Miroslav Ivanisevic told the media that the death toll stood at 30 and the amount injured at 135, but said those figures could rise as rescuers continue to reach victims.
SNT.31754.6104	Ivanisevic described the wreck "as the worst rail accident in the history of Montenegro," Ivanisevic also said.
SNT.31754.6105	President Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister, Milo Djukanovic also rushed to the site.
SNT.31754.6106	"A terrible tragedy happened at Bioče and everything is being done to reduce the number of casualties as much as possible," Vujanovic told reporters.
SNT.31754.6107	Because of the accident, Montenegro's transport minister, Andrija Lompar, and National Railways chief Ranko Medenica resigned.
SNT.31754.6108	The driver of the train has been arrested because of suspicion of negligence.
SNT.31754.6109	The train was heading from the northeastern town of Bijelo Polje to the Montenegrin coastal city of Bar.
SNT.124676.6110	The international community has condemned the Fijian president's decision to abrogate the constitution.
SNT.124676.6111	President Ratu Josefa Iloilo abrogated the country's constitution earlier today in response to a Court of Appeal decision declaring the removal of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and the appointment of military strongman Voreqe Bainimarama as interim Prime Minister unlawful.
SNT.124676.6112	Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd condemned the move, saying that it would take Fiji backwards.
SNT.124676.6113	He called for the government to obey the court of appeal's ruling and hold elections promptly.
SNT.124676.6114	"This is the right course for Fiji and the only way forward for the people of Fiji," he said.
SNT.124676.6115	New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said that the abrogation of the constitution "will merely compound the problems faced by ordinary Fijians".
SNT.124676.6116	"The President's decision, no doubt prompted by the Commodore, to override the constitution, sack the judges, and depend upon the military to keep an unlawful regime in power, will compound the already serious economic difficulties confronted by Fiji," McCully said.
SNT.124676.6117	In a televised address this morning, President Iloilo abrogated the constitution, revoked all judicial appointments, and appointed himself as head of state.
SNT.124676.6118	He said he would appoint a new interim government in the coming days to implement the reforms of the People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress and pave the way for "true democratic and parliamentary elections" to be held by September 2014.
SNT.124676.6119	Fiji's government was overthrown by a military coup in 2006.
SNT.51299.6120	A letter that had been written in 1988 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 Iranian Revolution and is Iran's former Supreme Leader has been made public by Iran's former president Hashemi Rafsanjani and states that Iran needed to acquire nuclear weapons in an attempt to win the war with Iraq.
SNT.51299.6121	The letter was reportadly sent to "political leaders" while the Iran-Iraq war was taking place.
SNT.51299.6122	BBC News says the letter states what would be needed if Iran was willing to continue any battle with the country of Iraq.
SNT.51299.6123	Khomeini says that "more aircraft, helicopters, men and weapons" would be needed to continue the fight and that "within five years, need laser-guided and atomic weapons in order to win the war" with Iraq.
SNT.51299.6124	BBC News also say that Khomeini states Iran's economy "was operating at a level below zero."
SNT.51299.6125	He also said that people who were needed to volunteer for battle were "in short supply."
SNT.51299.6126	The letter also states that Khomeini was "forced" into a cease-fire of the Iran-Iraq war, which he says is "like drinking poison."
SNT.5317.6127	Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld faces a federal lawsuit brought today by the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights First, filed in his home state of Illinois.
SNT.5317.6128	The suit charges that he bears direct responsibility for the torture and abuse of detainees in U.S. military custody.
SNT.5317.6129	The lawsuit was filed in federal court on behalf of eight men who were subject to torture and abuse at the hands of U.S. forces under Secretary Rumsfeld's command.
SNT.5317.6130	The parties seek a court order declaring that Secretary Rumsfeld's actions are in violation of the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes and international law.
SNT.144618.6131	The American Physical Society has awarded its 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics to six scientists for their contributions to theories on the origin of mass, including the key concepts of the Higgs boson and Higgs mechanism.
SNT.144618.6132-1	The full citation stated the prize was awarded "For elucidation of the properties of spontaneous symmetry breaking in four-dimensional relativistic gauge theory and of the mechanism for the consistent generation of vector boson masses."
SNT.144618.6132-2	The J. J. Sakurai Prize will be presented at the APS 2010 meeting in Washington, DC at a special Ceremonial session in February 2010.
SNT.144618.6133	The Higgs mechanism is a key element of the electroweak theory that forms part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and of many models that go beyond it.
SNT.144618.6134	The papers that introduce this mechanism were published in the journal Physical Review Letters in 1964 and were each recognized as milestone papers by PRL's 50th anniversary celebration.
SNT.144618.6135	The Large Hadron Collider at CERN and the Tevatron in the United States are searching for a particle, the Higgs boson, that will constitute evidence for this theory.
SNT.144618.6136	Because of its importance this particle is often referred to as the "God Particle".
SNT.144618.6137	The LHC, a vast scientific experiment to smash together sub-atomic particles, recently moved a step closer to its goal.
SNT.144618.6138	On Friday physicists announced they had sent protons all the way round the 27 km ring beneath the France–Switzerland border, and on Monday announced the first successful collisions.
SNT.144618.6139	This follows a major setback which shut down the collider for 14 months.
SNT.77803.6140	The Houston Astros have fired manager Phil Garner and general manager Tim Purpura less than two years after leading the team to its first World Series appearance (2005).
SNT.77803.6141	Bench coach Cecil Cooper was appointed interim manager and team president Tal Smith will serve as interim general manager.
SNT.77803.6142	"I felt this was the time for a change," owner Drayton McLane said.
SNT.77803.6143	Garner took over the Astros in the middle of the 2004 season after Jimy Williams was fired.
SNT.77803.6144	The Astros went 48-26 in the second half and won 36 of their last 46 games to win the NL wild card, then defeated Atlanta in the first round of the playoffs before losing to St. Louis in Game 7 of the NL Championship Series.
SNT.77803.6145	He has a 985-1,054 career record as a major league manager, including 277-252 with the Astros.
SNT.77803.6146	Purpura joined the organization in 1994 and directed player development and the Astros' six minor league affiliates before taking over from Gerry Hunsicker as GM before the 2005 season.
SNT.77803.6147	The Astros are currently in fifth place in the National League Central with a record of 58-73.
SNT.53813.6148	The New Zealand government has now introduced graphic health warnings on cigarette packs.
SNT.53813.6149	The new warnings, which replace the text warnings, will show images of gangrenous toes, rotting gums and teeth and diseased lungs and will also include the quit smoking Quitline number.
SNT.53813.6150	The new warnings will cover 30% of the front side and 90% of the back.
SNT.53813.6151	The new warnings will come into effect January 2007 but the manufacturers will not have to produce the new warnings until February 27, 2008 and retailers have till August 2008 to clear all their old stock.
SNT.53813.6152	Damien O'Conner, associate minister of health and ex-smoker, said: "Pictures were more effective than written warnings."
SNT.53813.6153	Actually seeing what it does to you is probably more acute than just reading the words on a cigarette packet.
SNT.53813.6154	The approach is designed to shock people into realising smoking kills and causes serious illness.
SNT.53813.6155	"Using powerful imagery to remind people of the real and horrific effects of smoking will act to deter smokers and discourage New Zealand's young from starting the habit in the first place."
SNT.53813.6156	Other countries which also show graphic warnings include Australia and Canada; they say that the warnings are effective.
SNT.53813.6157	Chris Laurenson, Health Ministry team leader national drug policy, said that international evidence was strong.
SNT.53813.6158	"That was confirmed by research in New Zealand which supported the effectiveness of pictorial labelling."
SNT.53813.6159	Altogether there will be fourteen images, of which seven will be released first, with rest following.
SNT.53813.6160	Mr O'Connor said: "The images were horrific; but they are what happen to people who smoke in this country."
SNT.53813.6161	However, according to Mr O'Conner, one company had used removable sticker that were later removed due to consultation.
SNT.53813.6162	The industries will not be reimbursed for any cost that may occur.
SNT.53813.6163	"They understand what it might mean if they don't and I'm confident that they will," Mr O'Connor said.
SNT.53813.6164	"They have already been implemented in other countries and the NZ tobacco industry has the technology to print the new packets within weeks," Becky Freeman, the Action on Smoking and Health director said.
SNT.53813.6165	World Heath Organization rules make New Zealand obliged to increase the warning sizes on packets.
SNT.4088.6166	Scientists studying data from the Chandra X-ray telescope have found strong evidence for the missing half of ordinary matter in the universe.
SNT.4088.6167	Two immense intergalactic clouds confirm the existence of a cosmic web of hot gas, predicted by computer simulations, containing baryons, the material making up visible objects in the Universe.
SNT.4088.6168	"An inventory of all the baryons in stars and gas inside and outside of galaxies accounts for just over half the baryons that existed shortly after the Big Bang," Fabrizio Nicastro of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
SNT.4088.6169	"Now we have found the likely hiding place of the missing baryons."
SNT.4088.6170	Nicastro is lead author of a paper in the February 3, 2005 issue of Nature describing the recent research.
SNT.4088.6171	Various measurements give a good estimate of the mass-density of baryons - the neutrons and protons that make up the nuclei of atoms and ions - in the Universe 10 billion years ago.
SNT.4088.6172	However, sometime during the last 10 billion years a large fraction of the baryons, commonly referred to as "ordinary matter" to distinguish them from dark matter and dark energy, have gone missing.
SNT.4088.6173	Using the computer predictions, Nicastro and colleagues searched specifically for the diffuse system of gas clouds galaxies and galaxy clusters form within.
SNT.4088.6174	Evidence of the clouds had been previously detected around our own galaxy and in the Local Group, but the temperature range (a few hundred thousand to a million degrees Celsius) and low density have prevented detection outside the immediate neighborhood of galaxies and the reliable estimation of baryon density for the entire universe.
SNT.4088.6175	The clouds were detected using Chandra observations when the galaxy Mkn 421 brightened in X-ray emissions.
SNT.4088.6176	The X-ray spectral data showed two hot gas clouds, 150 million and 370 million light years distant, absorbing the X-rays from Mkn 421.
SNT.4088.6177	The data shows the presence of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon present in the clouds.
SNT.4088.6178	Combined with other data the research team determined the thickness and mass of the clouds.
SNT.4088.6179	Assuming that the size and distribution of the clouds are representative, Nicastro and colleagues made the first reliable estimate of average density of baryons in such clouds throughout the Universe, finding it consistent with the mass density of the missing baryons.
SNT.4088.6180	Mkn 421 was observed three times with Chandra's Low-Energy Transmission Grating (LETG), twice in conjunction with the High Resolution Camera (May 2000 and July 2003) and once with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (October 2002).
SNT.4088.6181	The distance to Mkn 421 is 400 million light years.
SNT.140237.6182	With the United States Australian rules football National Championship this weekend, Wikinews interviewed United States Australian Football League (USFooty) president Rich Mann, and Media Relations representative Kevin Smith.
SNT.140237.6183	The USAFL Nationals will feature teams from the United States and Canada.
SNT.140237.6184	This means that an American team can have no more than nine players who aren't Americans and a Canadian team no more than nine non-Canadians.
SNT.140237.6185	Australian rules football is played on a field 170 metres by 160 metres.
SNT.140237.6186	According to USFooty, the tournament will attract over 1000 players.
SNT.140237.6187	The tournament will have four divisions for men and one for woman.
SNT.116773.6188	Pirates have seized control of the Sirius Star, a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the coast of Kenya and are steering her towards Somalia, reports the US Navy.
SNT.116773.6189	The ship was captured roughly 830 kilometers south-east of Mombasa and is reportedly heading towards the Somali port of Eyl.
SNT.116773.6190	The oil tanker was carrying over 2 million barrels of oil at the time of her capture, and was on her way to the United States via Cape Town.
SNT.116773.6191	Reuters claimed that news of the attack raised crude oil prices around the world.
SNT.116773.6192	Vela International Marine, the ship's owner, has said the Sirius Star is fully loaded.
SNT.116773.6193	The US Navy reports that all 25 crew from the United Kingdom, Croatia, the Philippines, Poland, and Saudi Arabia are 'safe'.
SNT.116773.6194	The area off the East coast of Africa has seen a significant amount of piracy.
SNT.116773.6195	In 2007, one-third of the world's piracy incidents occurred in this region.
SNT.116773.6196	Hijacking off the coast of Somalia has become increasingly common over the last decade.
SNT.116773.6197	Over the last year multiple countries have expressed concern or committed their navies to dealing with Somali pirates.
SNT.116773.6198	Most recently, South Korea has announced intentions to send one of its destroyers after five South Koreans were kidnapped in a Japanese cargo ship hijacking.
SNT.116773.6199	The Sirius Star is the largest ship captured by pirates in the area to date.
SNT.116773.6200	This also sets a record for the farthest from the shore that pirates have struck.
SNT.713110.6201	Yesterday, the Milwaukee County district attorney charged Cory J. Feerick, a 33-year-old from Brookfield, Wisconsin, with five misdemeanor counts of stealing US$35,000 worth of flush valves from fast food restaurants and university toilets and urinals.
SNT.713110.6202	If convicted, Feerick could spend to 9 to 45 months in jail, and pay between US$10,000 and US$50,000 in fines.
SNT.713110.6203	Initially arrested in late January following a local news television story on the thefts, he stands accused of stealing parts worth between US$300 and US$600 each from locations that included Milwaukee Area Technical College, Waukesha County Technical College, ITT Technical Institute, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Marquette University, the Pick 'n Save on Capitol Drive in Brookfield, and the Arby’s also located on Capitol Drive in Brookfield.
SNT.713110.6204	Feerick was dubbed the "Backpack Bathroom Bandit" by the media because video showed him committing the thefts while wearing a backpack.
SNT.713110.6205	The thefts reportedly took place in September and October of last year, with several area police departments involved in investigating them.
SNT.14682.6206	The New York Yankees rebounded from a tough loss on Saturday to win Sunday's game 9-4 against the Cleveland Indians thanks to some timely hitting.
SNT.14682.6207	Randy Johnson (9-6) allowed three runs on nine hits, six of which were leadoff hits.
SNT.14682.6208	His performance bested Tribe starter Jake Westbrook (6-11), who pitched well to start the game but then surrendered two runs in the 4th inning and three in the 5th as the Yankees' hitters constructed a lead.
SNT.14682.6209	Recently acquired reliever Wayne Franklin threatened to lose the lead in the 7th inning, but was saved by Tanyon Sturtze, who came on to get the final out of the inning.
SNT.14682.6210	Gary Sheffield then responded in the bottom of the inning with a three-run homer hit deep into the right-center field bleachers, stretching the Yankee lead to 9-4.
SNT.14682.6211	Mariano Rivera closed out the game with a two-inning appearance, recording his 20th save.
SNT.14682.6212	He enters the All-Star break preparing for Tuesday's game, along with Sheffield and Alex Rodriguez.
SNT.14682.6213	The Yankees currently trail the AL East leader Boston Red Sox by 2.5 games, but face tough road series against the BoSox, Rangers, and Angels when play resumes on Thursday.
SNT.999.6214	On Wednesday North Korea's official media dropped Kim Jong Il's honourific title "Dear leader", reported Japan's Radiopress.
SNT.999.6215	It was only days after the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported that portraits of Kim Jong Il have recently been removed from public display in North Korea.
SNT.999.6216	According to Radiopress, a Japanese news agency that monitors North Korea's radio broadcasts, the North's Korean Central Broadcasting Station, as well as the Korean Central News Agency and other North Korean media, have stopped using the term "Dear leader" when referring to Kim Jong Il, the country's supreme leader.
SNT.999.6217	Now the media in North Korea only use the official titles "General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea", " the Chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission" and/or "Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army" when referring to Kim.
SNT.999.6218	Earlier Itar-Tass also reported that according to an unnamed foreign diplomat in Pyongyang, Kim Jong Il's portraits have recently been taken down from public display secretly and without explanation.
SNT.999.6219	However, the portraits of Kim's father, Kim Il Sung, still remain, according to the same report.
SNT.999.6220	This report has been confirmed by some expatriates living in the country.
SNT.999.6221	This recent development in North Korea has given rise to speculation among analysts, some of whom suspected that these may be a sign that Kim is losing power, or that a power struggle is going on among the top leaders of the totalitarian state.
SNT.999.6222	But most observers believe that the portraits were taken down by the order of Kim Jong Il himself, who might be trying to downsize his own personality cult.
SNT.999.6223	"We believe the change was made at his will to soften his image as a leader of a personality cult, although it is hard to determine what his real intentions are," said Shinya Kato, the editor of Radiopress.
SNT.999.6224	South Korean officials are not yet speculating on the matter, saying the portrait removals "may be for various reasons."
SNT.999.6225	North Korea is one of the few Stalinist states that still exist today, and the political control in the country remains tight.
SNT.999.6226	In recent years North Korea underwent several minor reforms that did not appear to significantly improve quality of life.
SNT.999.6227	It has also remained largely mysterious and secretive to the outside world, as few foreign correspondents are allowed to visit and stay in the country.
SNT.98289.6228	California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his support for Arizona Senator John McCain's presidential bid Thursday morning.
SNT.98289.6229	Schwarzenegger called McCain "a great American hero and an extraordinary leader" and praised him for his ability to cross party lines.
SNT.98289.6230	"I think Senator McCain has proven over and over again that he is reaching across the aisle to get things done," Schwarzenegger said.
SNT.98289.6231	Also present was former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who recently dropped out of the race and pledged to support McCain.
SNT.98289.6232	"This is a man who is moving us into our future," Giuliani said.
SNT.98289.6233	"He understands how to do it and also understands how to keep us safe in a time of peril."
SNT.98289.6234	Schwarzenegger said he also admires Giuliani and only decided to endorse McCain after Giuliani had dropped out.
SNT.98289.6235	"Both of them are friends of mine and this is why I really didn't want to endorse anybody," Schwarzenegger said.
SNT.98289.6236	McCain used this as an opportunity to discuss his views on greenhouse gas emissions and environmental technology, which have come under criticism from others in the Republican Party.
SNT.98289.6237	"We don't have to have increased costs to Americans," McCain said.
SNT.98289.6238	"In fact, with the development of green technologies, we can have reduced costs to the American consumer with the development of new technologies."
SNT.98289.6239	California is one of the 24 states whose primary will be held on February 5, also known as Super Tuesday.

SNT.80610.6242	Marcus du Sautoy is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford.
SNT.80610.6243	He is not only a researcher; he had great success with the popular book The Music of the Primes.
SNT.80610.6244	His last book Finding Moonshine will be published in English in February 2008.

SNT.28645.6247	One year on from the Indian Ocean tsunami, the world's grief and compassion returned to the tsunami-battered coastlines of the Indian Ocean, where at least 216 000 people lost their lives.
SNT.28645.6248	Under a clear sky and before a gentle sea, the world commemorated those lost their lives, in one of the worst natural disasters that the modern world has experienced.
SNT.28645.6249	Since the Indian Ocean tsunami, patchy progress has been made on the return to a normal life for those who lived through the experience.
SNT.28645.6250	Efforts to implement a warning system similar to that coordinated by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii have past a number of significant milestones.
SNT.28645.6251	Tourist resorts in many places have been rebuilt, and many visiting them at this time do so as a form of remembrance.
SNT.28645.6252	Yet still there remain those who may never recover from the tragic events of one year ago.
SNT.28645.6253	Some $13 billion was pledged to relief and recovery efforts, of which 75 percent has already been secured.

SNT.50732.6258-1	A businessman currently representing his place of employment in Thailand has left the following eyewitness account for Wikinews:
SNT.50732.6258-2	 :"How safe are the streets of Bangkok?"
SNT.50732.6258-3	" As a somewhat nervous US citizen holed up in a hotel room in this massive South Asian metropolis, I decided to venture forth and see for myself."
SNT.50732.6259	"For courage as much as anything, I walked with my close friend and business partner, who like me, hails from San Diego, California."
SNT.50732.6260	:"I left my suite at the Royal River Hotel and walked down Soi Charansandwong, the narrow street that leads from the hotel to the busy road that crosses the city and shortly thereafter, the Chao Phraya River, known as the 'River of Kings."
SNT.50732.6261	:"Thailand does, indeed, love their kings, or particularly, their current King."
SNT.50732.6262-1	"Evidence of this is clear:"
SNT.50732.6262-2	"at least a third of the people walking on the streets wear the 'King Shirt,' a bright yellow shirt that bears the crest of the King."
SNT.50732.6263	:"Even newsreaders on the local television news can sometimes be seen wearing the yellow shirt as a showing of support for the King."
SNT.50732.6264	:"Leaving the alleyway, we walked to the busy Thonburi district."
SNT.50732.6265	"Immediately, I could see a group of soldiers, some standing, others sitting, along a sidewalk on the main street."
SNT.50732.6266	"They had set up a check point, but I saw but one vehicle stopped, a beat up truck that appeared to have come in from the countryside, loaded with fruit."
SNT.50732.6267	:"We passed all the various businesses along the street as we walked, all open and apparently unaffected by the Coup."
SNT.50732.6268	:"Walking slowly down to where the soldiers were and smiling at them as we walked, we approached the man who appeared to be the commanding officer."
SNT.50732.6269	"He smiled back and asked us where we were from."
SNT.50732.6270	"He was a bit business like at first, but this was a man who had a job to do, of course."
SNT.50732.6271	"It appears that the military, for the most part, is present as a show of support and to act if any anti-Coup action should take place."
SNT.50732.6272	:"My friend noticed that the soldiers appeared to be uncomfortable in their uniforms, not the most comfortable clothing to wear in the hot and humid world that is Bangkok."
SNT.50732.6273	:"Each soldier, unable to wear a yellow shirt and stay in uniform, instead bore a yellow ribbon of support for the King, usually tied to his rifle."
SNT.50732.6274	:"Walking back to a small stand, we purchased twenty bottles of cold drinks and returned to the soldiers and handed them to the officer in charge."
SNT.50732.6275	"He smiled and accepted the offering and handed them out to his men."
SNT.50732.6276	:"As we continued to walk down the sidewalk, three women came out of their shop, one wearing a yellow king shirt, and they thanked us for the gesture."
SNT.50732.6277	:"The streets of Bangkok, otherwise, appeared completely normal in all respects."
SNT.50732.6278	"Street vendors hawked various items of food, car shops were installing high tech stereo systems and dogs, here and there, sat quietly in whatever shady spot they could find."
SNT.50732.6279	:"We crossed the street and walked down an alleyway to the nearest Temple."
SNT.50732.6280	"Walking on the cool, green grounds of the Temple complex, the Coup felt like it was a million miles distant."
SNT.50732.6281	"Bowing and placing our palms together, we greeted a monk on the grounds who was trimming a hedge."
SNT.50732.6282	"Despite the Coup, Bangkok seemingly remains peaceful in all respects."
SNT.50732.6283	"We could smell the delightful scent of freshly cut grass."
SNT.50732.6284	:"Earlier, I asked the doorman at the Royal River Hotel what he thought about the Coup."
SNT.50732.6285-1	"'We needed it', he smiled,"
SNT.50732.6285-2	 'things were too corrupt.'
SNT.50732.6286	"It should all be over in three days or so."
SNT.50732.6287	"But, certainly, I felt no danger on the street from the army or from anyone I encountered."
SNT.50732.6288	"Returning to Soi Charansandwong, I approached an ATM and withdrew a couple of hundred dollars worth of Baht, the currency of Thailand, with my US bank issued card."
SNT.50732.6289	:"Money in hand, I entered a tailor shop and sat down with the shop manager, who was from India, and ordered a new suit to be made."
SNT.50732.6290	"As he measured me, I asked if business had been slowed due to the Coup."
SNT.50732.6291	I sold a suit today to another American, as a matter of fact.'
SNT.50732.6292	"He promised me that my suit, which included two pairs of pants and two custom made dress shirts, would be ready early the next morning."
SNT.50732.6293	:"We left the alleyway and once again walked down the busy road."
SNT.50732.6294	"The commanding officer gave us a very big smile this time as we passed him and several of the soldiers gave smaller, shy smiles as we passed."
SNT.50732.6295	"Encouraged, we once again popped into a small shop and bought additional soft drinks to hand out."
SNT.8966.6296	Actress Hunter Tylo is reported to have rejoined the cast of The Bold and the Beautiful, in the latest chapter of a rocky relationship between Tylo and the casting office.
SNT.8966.6297	The news was first broken by entertainment magazine Soap Opera Weekly.
SNT.8966.6298	Tylo played the role of Dr. Taylor Hamilton Forrester from 1990 until 2002, when she was killed off by villainess Sheila Carter, played by Kimberlin Brown.
SNT.8966.6299	Taylor's love affair with Ridge Forrester (played by Ronn Moss), and the ensuing triangle with Brooke Logan (played by Katherine Kelly Lang), helped the then-fledgling soap move higher in the ratings in the early to mid-1990s.
SNT.8966.6300	According to Soap Opera Weekly, history has been rewritten so that Taylor, in reality, did not die from her gunshot wounds back in October 2002.
SNT.8966.6301	Her return is tied in with a 1994 storyline in which Taylor was held captive by Moroccan prince Omar (played by Indian actor Kabir Bedi).
SNT.8966.6302	Both Tylo and Bedi are first seen on Monday, May 2.
SNT.8966.6303	The magazine states that she has been on the set of the soap opera at CBS Television City since March 11.
SNT.8966.6304	For a while, she didn't even tell her husband, former Guiding Light actor Michael Tylo, where she was really going.
SNT.8966.6305	She told him that she was just going on "a lot of auditions," and that if she told sooner than she did, the news might slip out accidentally.
SNT.8966.6306	Her husband currently teaches a class at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and she couldn't afford any accidental hints that his students could have picked up on.
SNT.8966.6307	This is not the first time Tylo has rejoined the series.
SNT.8966.6308	She left in highly publicized disputes most recently in 2000 and 2001, due to a lack of story for her character.
SNT.8966.6309-1	Her most publicized departure, however, was in 1996;
SNT.8966.6309-2	Tylo was scheduled to join the cast of Melrose Place and was fired when Melroses producer Aaron Spelling found out she was pregnant.
SNT.8966.6310	She took him to court and won after nearly a year of messy legal battles.
SNT.8966.6311	All three times she was allowed to return to the show more or less without comment.
SNT.8966.6312	With more than 300 million viewers in nearly 100 countries, The Bold and the Beautiful is claimed to be the most-watched television series in the world.
SNT.44127.6313	The US House of Reprensentatives is seeking to lift a nine year old ban on export sales of the F-22A Raptor stealth fighter.
SNT.44127.6314	US lawmakers approved an amendment that would allow Lockheed Martin, the aircraft's primary manufacturer, to sell the aircraft overseas to foreign nations.
SNT.44127.6315	Every defence bill since 1997 contained language that prohibited the sale of the multi-role aircraft to foreign nations, due to concerns that the advanced technology in the plane may reach the wrong hands.
SNT.44127.6316	Japan and South Korea, both strong allies of the United States are considered to be likely customers, if the ban is lifted.
SNT.44127.6317	The amendment was introduced by Rep. Kay Granger, (R-Texas), whose constituency, the Fort Worth district is home to a major Lockheed Martin facility.
SNT.44127.6318	The lifting of the ban comes at a time when continued US orders will no longer be guaranteed and that the aircraft's continued production is important for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' business.
SNT.113515.6319	On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election.

SNT.9027.6330	In an escalating controversy that has contributed to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's political problems and created a national uproar in Italy, Italian prosecutors began their own independent probe on Wednesday of the death of Nicola Calipari.
SNT.9027.6331	The premier has put his government's prestige on the line with assurances to the nation that full light would be shed on the shooting.
SNT.9027.6332	Calipari, one of the top intelligence agents in Italy, had negotiated a settlement with hostage takers in Baghdad and was rescuing journalist Giuliana Sgrena from them when American soldiers fired on the car they were in.
SNT.9027.6333	Calipari became a national hero for Italians after he bravely threw his own body across hers as the firing continued, killing him and seriously injuring Sgrena with a few bullets in her back.
SNT.9027.6334	Meanwhile, Americans released a document, now described as incomplete, which says the U.S. Army, in a joint inquiry with Italian officials, cleared its own soldiers of any responsibility in the tragic events of March 4.
SNT.143785.6335	South African Vipers completed a hat-trick to win their third consecutive Singapore Cricket Club International Rugby Sevens.
SNT.143785.6336	Unbeaten throughout the two day tournament the South African team beat Fijian team Davetalevu by a margin of 24 points without allowing the Fijian team to score throughout the 20 minute final.
SNT.143785.6337	In a replay of last years final, where the Vipers won 10-5, the mostly expatriate crowd rallied behind the Fijian team in an effort to create an upset against the Vipers who are the domestic development team of South African Sevens.
SNT.143785.6338	It was tough and tight start with both teams putting heavy tackles and showing strong defence until the sixth minute when the SA Vipers finally managed a fast run down the left wing to score a converted try.
SNT.143785.6339	From that point is looked ominous for Davetalevu as the Vipers began to find openings in nearly every move and only passionate defence keeping the Vipers at bay from further scoring, finishing the first half 5-0.
SNT.143785.6340	Only two minutes into the second half the Vipers breached Davetalevu's defence and scored a relatively easy try yet failing to convert.
SNT.143785.6341	A few minutes later Vipers crossed again and then scored a further try down the favoured left wing to bring the margin to 24-0 which would be the final score.
SNT.143785.6342	The talent and form of the South Africans clearly showed as they have been touring for the past months.
SNT.143785.6343	In the minor finals the Casuarina Cougars easily won the Bowl competition with a 17-0 defeat of Australian team East Arnhem Rugby.
SNT.143785.6344	The Plate final saw a strong performance from Borneo Eagles to beat New Zealand team Oriental Rongotai by 31 to 5.
SNT.143785.6345	Leading 12-5 at half-time the Eagles never seemed troubled during the final.
SNT.143785.6346	The weekend was an emotional event for the Brunei Flying Kukris who recently returned from a tour of Afghanistan where they tragically lost two of their regiment.
SNT.143785.6347	Serving out of Borneo the squad gathered before the commencement of their quarter-final to pay respect both to their own squadron but also in tribute to Remembrance Day which coincided with the weekend tournament.
SNT.143785.6348	A minute of silence in respect to fallen soldiers was observed.
SNT.143785.6349	Despite mixed results for the tournament the Kukris managed to qualify for the Jug Final.
SNT.143785.6350	Kukris scored a try after full-time yet failing to convert a relatively simple kick that would have won the game for them.
SNT.143785.6351	Final score was 21-20 with Singapore Barbarians taking the honours.
SNT.143785.6352	Featuring teams from thirteen nations from as far as Kenya, South Africa and Scotland the tournament has grown from success to success over the past years and now features on the calendar of major sporting events in Singapore.
SNT.143785.6353	The tournament began in 1947 as an invitational event for Singapore and Malaysian teams and since grown into national and club teams from around the world are invited.

SNT.62477.6356	The Namibian government has refused to remove value added tax (VAT) on the price of milk.
SNT.62477.6357	The Namibian Dairy producers organization requested the Namibian directorate of local income in May 2006 to follow the example of South Africa and declare fresh milk as a basic need upon which no taxation is applicable.
SNT.62477.6358	Calle Schlettwein, permanent Secretary of the Namibia Ministry of Finance said the decision not to discard VAT on milk is because of two reasons: "This industry is already receiving advantages because of Article 26 of the African Customs Union (SACU)," he said.
SNT.62477.6359	Namibia is a country that spend more than what it can collect through tax.
SNT.62477.6360	The price of fresh milk is to climb by 50c in the beginning of April 2007 following increases in production costs to producers.
SNT.62477.6361	The dairy industry has warned of a collapse of the industry and a dependence on foreign imports if prices are not increased to match rising production costs.
SNT.263035.6362	Two people were killed in a magnitude 5.9 earthquake in Turkey shortly before midnight local time on Thursday.
SNT.263035.6363-1	Officials said two people were killed;

SNT.263035.6365	Officials said a wastewater dam had not been damaged by the earthquake, and it posed "no risk."
SNT.263035.6366	The earthquake was felt as far away as the Aegean province of İzmir, the northwestern provinces of Bursa and İstanbul, and even the city of Edirne, not far from the Bulgarian and Greek and borders, because the depth was very shallow.
SNT.263035.6367	More than 18,000 people died following two earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 7.0 in northwestern Turkey in 1999.
SNT.87186.6368	Reports say that the host of the United States television game show Jeopardy!, Alex Trebek, 67 is being hospitalized after suffering from a minor heart attack.
SNT.87186.6369	"Alex Trebek, host of 'Jeopardy!,' has had a minor heart attack."
SNT.87186.6370	"He is resting comfortably in a Los Angeles, California hospital, and he will be back in the studio for the next scheduled tapings in January," said a spokesman for the show in a statement posted on the show's website.
SNT.87186.6371	Trebek is expected to remain in the hospital for at least two days for observation and continued tests.
SNT.50149.6372	A 35-year old woman, Venus Critchfield of Philipippi, West Virginia, United States was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to two to six years in prison.
SNT.50149.6373	Critchfield was accused of beating her stepchildren with boards, and using hooks and ropes to secure them and force them to stand for long periods of time.
SNT.50149.6374	Critchfield also forced the children to continuously eat food and drink, and then eat their own vomit.
SNT.50149.6375	Her stepson, now aged 17, described the abuse in court.
SNT.50149.6376	Circuit Judge Alan D. Moats called this the worst case he has seen in 30 years.
SNT.50149.6377	"You are the antithesis of everything that is a mother."
SNT.50149.6378	The abuse involved all six of Critchfield's children, however only some were willing to testify against her.
SNT.50149.6379	Critchfield pleaded guilty and was convicted of two counts of child abuse, with injury.
SNT.50149.6380	The charges pertained to abuse committed from January 2001 until January 2002.
SNT.50149.6381	State welfare services had removed the children, now 11-16 years old, from the Critchfields' care in previous cases.

SNT.189935.6387	Reports suggest the World Health Organisation's declaring a swine flu pandemic was an error driven by drug companies, and lead to unjustified fear.
SNT.189935.6388	A year after the swine flu pandemic was declared, stocks are left unused and governments try to abandon contracts, pharmaceutical companies have profited at least £4.6billion from the sale of vaccines alone.
SNT.189935.6389	Reports by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) and the Council of Europe claim that The World Health Organisation reaction to H1N1 was influenced by pharmaceutical companies and that key scientists behind advice had financial ties with firms Roche and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
SNT.189935.6390	These conflicts of interest have never been publicly disclosed by WHO, an apparent violation of its own rules.
SNT.189935.6391	The World Health Organisation issued H1N1 guidelines in 2004, recommending countries to stockpile millions of doses of antiviral medication.
SNT.189935.6392	The advice prompted many countries around the world into buying up large stocks of Tamiflu, made by Roche, and Relenza manufactured by GSK.
SNT.189935.6393	A joint investigation with the BMJ and the BIJ, found that scientists involved in developing the WHO 2004 guidance had previously been paid by Roche or GSK for lecturing and consultancy work as well as being involved in research for the companies.
SNT.189935.6394	"The WHO's credibility has been badly damaged," BMJ editor Fiona Godlee said in an editorial.
SNT.189935.6395	A report by the health committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a 47-member human rights watchdog, found that the WHO's reaction was influenced by drug companies that make H1N1 antiviral drugs and vaccines.
SNT.189935.6396	It criticised WHO lack of transparency around the handling of the swine flu pandemic and says the public health guidelines by WHO, EU agencies and national governments led to a "waste of large sums of public money and unjustified scares and fears about the health risks faced by the European public."
SNT.189935.6397	A spokesman for WHO said the drug industry did not influence its decisions on swine flu.
SNT.189935.6398-1	Margaret Chan, the organisation's director, had dismissed inquiries into its handling of the A/H1N1 pandemic as "conspiracy theories" earlier this year, 
SNT.189935.6398-2	she had said: "WHO anticipated close scrutiny of its decisions, but we did not anticipate that we would be accused, by some European politicians, of having declared a fake pandemic on the advice of experts with ties to the pharmaceutical industry and something personal to gain from increased industry profits."
SNT.189935.6399	Yesterday, a 16-member "emergency committee" consisting of advisors from the World Health Organisation said that the H1N1 pandemic is not yet over.
SNT.189935.6400	The WHO has refused to identify committee members, arguing that they must be shielded from industry pressure, so possible conflicts of interest with drug companies are unknown.
SNT.189935.6401	The BMJ report also reveals that at least one expert on the "emergency committee" received payment during 2009 from GSK.
SNT.189935.6402	In related news, Reuters reported, Pfizer Inc, the world's biggest drugmaker, is selling its swine vaccine business to Chinese Harbin Pharmaceutical Group for $50 million.
SNT.60919.6403	Celia Franca, founder of the National Ballet of Canada and its training ground, the National Ballet School of Canada, died at age 85 Monday in Ottawa, Ontario.
SNT.60919.6404	She is reported to have died in an Ottawa Hospital and her cause of death is not known.
SNT.60919.6405	She went to the hospital last week and stayed there until she had died.
SNT.60919.6406	"She was its presiding spirit, its most stalwart supporter and the embodiment of its ideals and values," said Karen Kain, the National Ballet of Canada's current artistic director.
SNT.60919.6407	"She inspired generations of dancers by her example and her devotion to the art of ballet."
SNT.60919.6408	"And most importantly, she made us believe in ourselves and that no goal was ever out of reach."
SNT.60919.6409	Franca, born 1921 in London, England, came to Canada in 1951 to found the National Ballet of Canada.
SNT.60919.6410	Franca choreographed ballets in Canada such as the famous "Cinderella" and "The Nutcracker."
SNT.60919.6411	She was artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada for 24 years.
SNT.60919.6412	In 1967, Franca was named an officer of the Order of Canada, then named a Companion of the order in 1985.
SNT.41248.6413	Lordi, described as "cartoon metalheads" wearing latex monster masks, beat runner-up Russian "heart throb" Dima Bilan to win this year's 51st Eurovision song contest held in Athens, Greece.
SNT.41248.6414	In a spectacular show, hosted by Maria Menounos and Sakis Rouvas, Lordi amassed 292 points after a public vote - 44 ahead of Russia.
SNT.41248.6415	Greece's singer Anna Vissi, who was one of the favourites to win, came 9th, followed by Ireland's Brian Kennedy.
SNT.41248.6416	From the start of the song contest as well as during the televoting, the Greek organisers presented viewers choreographies and dances inspired by Greek culture and music, both ancient and modern.
SNT.41248.6417	In addition, the world famous Greek singer Nana Moushouri was presented by the hosts and gave the sign for the start of televoting.
SNT.41248.6418	Wielding spark-spewing instruments, the "Monster-themed" rock band beat 23 other competitors, scoring 292 points from telephone voters in 38 countries with its song "Hard Rock Hallelujah" in a performance that both shocked and amused viewers.
SNT.41248.6419	A spokesperson for Lordi said: "We won the contest, looking like this,"he said.
SNT.41248.6420	"It just goes to show that Europe is not such a bad place."
SNT.41248.6421	The Finnish band thanked viewers for voting for their song, which featured the lead singer hoisting a double-headed-axe microphone stand above his head.
SNT.41248.6422	The win has been dubbed as a "radical departure" from the catchy pop tunes, folk songs and emotional ballads normally associated with Eurovision.
SNT.41248.6423	Complete with distorted guitars, a catchy chorus and "mock-demonic imagery," Lordi is reminiscent of 1970s American band Kiss - an inspiration acknowledged by lead singer Mr Lordi.
SNT.41248.6424	"What this has shown is that there are different styles of music than just pop and rock," Mr Lordi told news media after the surprise victory.
SNT.41248.6425	Mr. Lordi, whose real name is Tomi Putaansuu, hails from Lapland and says his band's masked personas are just characters.
SNT.41248.6426	"The guys behind the masks are not interesting - underneath, there's just a boring, normal guy who walks the dogs, goes to the supermarket, watches DVDs and eats candies."
SNT.41248.6427	But the characters "live on stage and they live in a fantasy world", he said.
SNT.41248.6428	"This element of mystery is one of the cornerstones of Lordi."
SNT.41248.6429	The band has upset many Finns with their outrageous behaviour.
SNT.41248.6430	"This is a victory for rock music... and also a victory for open-mindedness," Mr Lordi said.
SNT.41248.6431	"For the millionth time, we're not Satanists or devil worshippers."
SNT.41248.6432	"The masks are like our calling card and we'll　never perform without them."
SNT.41248.6433	"It would be like Santa Claus handing a child his gifts at Christmas time and then pulling off his beard…"
SNT.41248.6434	The 51st annual Eurovision was broadcast live across Europe, watched by an estimated 100 million viewers.
SNT.41248.6435	Regarded by many as the "contest good taste forgot," Eurovision is adored by fans of kitsch and camp everywhere.
SNT.41248.6436	Lordi join the likes of Abba, Bucks Fizz, Dana and Celine Dion on the elite list of Eurovision winners.
SNT.41248.6437	Because of Lordi's first place finish, next year the 52nd Eurovision Song Contest will take place, for the first time, in Helsinki, Finland.
SNT.114665.6438	Zimbabwe's 4.5 million students will not receive what was once the golden standard of education in Africa—or any education at all this school year.
SNT.114665.6439	Political violence during the country's recent presidential elections hit schools hard with strikes, murder and violence against teachers, and looting.
SNT.114665.6440	Some schools were turned into places of torture after teachers were driven out.
SNT.114665.6441	The country's educators were targeted by Zimbabwe's ZANU-PF party, for alleged support of the opposition.
SNT.114665.6442	Now the country faces a second crisis due to economic troubles and an inflation rate of two trillion percent.
SNT.114665.6443	The few teachers still around have seen their salaries made worthless and are unable to acquire teaching supplies.
SNT.114665.6444	"We don't even have chalk, or red pens, never mind books," says Amos Musoni, one of the few teachers still working.
SNT.114665.6445	Schools like the one where Musoni works have given up educating and simply entertain the children before sending them off for lack of equipment.
SNT.114665.6446	The universities have been unable to open without funds, water, or electricity, like many public schools.
SNT.114665.6447	College students, unable to register, are left waiting for more information.
SNT.114665.6448	Pass rates in the nation went from 72 to eleven percent, with many schools not seeing even one pass.
SNT.114665.6449	Schools in the countries have not been able to prepare students for tests without timetables or even the results from last year.
SNT.22186.6450	In New York, speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative, British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke with "brutal honesty" about the UNFCCC's Kyoto protocol and global warming.
SNT.22186.6451-1	Blair, a longtime supporter of the Kyoto treaty, recognized that countries will not accept the limits imposed on Kyoto:
SNT.22186.6451-2	"No country is going to cut its growth."
SNT.22186.6452	Of India and China, "They're not going to start negotiating another treaty like Kyoto."
SNT.22186.6453	India and China are classified as developing countries in the Kyoto protocol, so they can get money and technology but are not restricted by its limits.
SNT.3307.6454	In a ceremony attended by several European political leaders and 5,000 VIP guests, Airbus unveiled plans for the A380, a twin-deck aircraft that can carry up to 840 people in all-economy class (550 for a Boeing 747), or 555 people in typical three mixed classes layout.
SNT.3307.6455	The new aircraft will take the world's-largest title away from rival Boeing's 747.
SNT.3307.6456	Boeing's upcoming new design, the 7e7, does not attempt to compete directly with the A380 but instead is aimed at a more efficient and comfortable flight at 200-250 seats.
SNT.3307.6457	Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard stated that he expected sales of the aircraft to exceed the 250 required for the project to break even.
SNT.3307.6458	To date, 149 confirmed orders for the aircraft have been received.
SNT.3307.6459	The company is currently in talks with China regarding possible sales there.
SNT.3307.6460	The first test flight of the aircraft may take place as early as March, and the first commercial flight is expected to take off in mid-2006 from Singapore's Changi Airport.
SNT.3307.6461	British and American airline Virgin Atlantic has purchased six of these aeroplanes and intend to fit them with gyms and bars as well as seats.
SNT.45663.6462	Steven Lacey, 56, from Brooten, Minnesota, was killed in a one-vehicle rollover late Sunday night, July 16, 2006.
SNT.45663.6463	The Pope County Sheriff’s Office said that at approximately 11 p.m. his vehicle went off the road and rolled over on 110th Avenue, near Brooten, Minnesota, in Pope County, Minnesota's Bangor Township, about 15 miles SE from Glenwood, MN, about 55 miles WNW from St. Cloud, MN, or about 100 miles NW from the Twin Cities.
SNT.45663.6464	The victim was reportedly killed on impact when his 1995 Chevy pickup rolled over after leaving the road.
SNT.45663.6465	The Pope County Sheriff's department reports that Lacey was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.
SNT.23683.6466	A red tide continues along South Padre Island and into Mexico, according to officials with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
SNT.23683.6467	Effects include stinging eyes, respiratory difficulties, and dead marine life.
SNT.23683.6468	Red tide is caused by a higher than normal concentration of Karenia brevis, a naturally-occurring single-celled marine organism.
SNT.23683.6469	Natural factors can intersect to produce ideal conditions, allowing this algae to increase in number dramatically.
SNT.23683.6470	The algae produces a neurotoxin that can disable nerves in both humans and fish.
SNT.23683.6471	Fish often die because of the high concentrations of the toxin in the waters.
SNT.23683.6472	Humans can be affected by breathing affected water taken into the air by wind and waves.
SNT.23683.6473	Also, South Padre officials are investigating a paralyzed cat and deceased coyote who may have consumed fish killed by the red tide.
SNT.23683.6474	This bloom has lingered almost three weeks, and affects waters parallel to South Padre Island for about 25 miles, and may extend as far as 10 miles along Mexico beaches.
SNT.77424.6475	South Africa has won the first One-Day International of the series against Zimbabwe by five wickets at Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.
SNT.77424.6476	Vernon Philander took two wickets in two balls and some poor running decisions led to five run outs in the whole innings.
SNT.77424.6477	Elton Chigumbura and Gary Brent fought back for Zimbabwe with a partnership of 115 runs, with Chigumbura being run out for 59 runs and Brent finishing on 59 not out.
SNT.77424.6478	The pair recovered Zimbabwe's innings which finished at 206 all out after fifty overs.
SNT.77424.6479	South Africa suffered an early blow when opening batsman Loots Bosman was dismissed in the first over, but captain Graeme Smith and ODI debutant Gulam Bodi added 72 runs together, followed by a partnership of 74 runs from Bodi and A B de Villiers.
SNT.77424.6480	Smith (50 runs), Bodi (51) and de Villiers (63) all made half centuries, and South Africa comfortably reached the target with nineteen balls remaining.
SNT.77424.6481	The second ODI will be held at Harare Sports Club, Harare on August 25, with the final ODI the day afterwards.

SNT.253693.6483	Treasury documents released today under the Freedom of Information (FOI) act reveal that Australians could face up to an A$863 rise in household costs per annum if the government proceeds with its plans to put a tax on carbon emissions.
SNT.253693.6484	The documents reveal an a annual price rise of $218.40 for electricity, $114.40 for gas, $187.20 for petrol and $88.40 for food for the average household.
SNT.253693.6485	The treasury modelling was based on a $30 carbon tax, but also estimated other prices such as a $40 tax which predicted a rise of over $1,100 to the average household's annual budget.
SNT.253693.6486	However, they do not take into account the compensation deals and offsets promised by the government if a price is put on carbon.
SNT.253693.6487	After viewing the treasury modelling, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Climate Change Minister Greg Combet released a joint statement saying without the finalization of compensation packages it is too early to predict price rises.
SNT.253693.6488	"No final decisions on the starting price or assistance have been taken and therefore it is far too early to speculate on any potential price impacts," the statement said.
SNT.253693.6489	"Until the final design and modelling have been settled, anyone who uses these figures to scare families about prices is engaging in a dishonest, misleading scare campaign."
SNT.253693.6490	Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said the figures demonstrated the toll a carbon tax would have on Australian families.
SNT.253693.6491	"This just demonstrates that the Government has known all along that its carbon tax won't clean up the environment but it will clean out your wallet," he said.
SNT.253693.6492	"That's right and this is $863 a year in extra burden that the Australian people shouldn't have to pay."
SNT.253693.6493	"This is an $863 a year hit on families' cost of living."
SNT.253693.6494	"They don't need a bad situation made much, much worse by Julia Gillard's carbon tax."
SNT.253693.6495	The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has also officially opposed the adoption of a carbon tax.
SNT.253693.6496	A resolution was passed by all 30 members at their general meeting to reject the Federal government's plan.
SNT.87398.6497	On the eve of December 7, 2007 Dr. Reginald Humayun, a Christian doctor working for Pennell Memorial Christian Hospital in Bannu, Pakistan, was kidnapped along with his driver while returning from a trip to Dera Ismail Khan.
SNT.87398.6498	The doctor, a medical superintendent at that hospital, was also the General Secretary of the Church of Pakistan.
SNT.87398.6499	The All Pakistan Minority Alliance, the Church of Pakistan and the Christian community as a whole have appealed to the Government to expedite efforts for the doctor's safe recovery.
SNT.87398.6500	Dar Ali Khatak, leading the investigation by the Bannu Police has expressed deep concerns and vows to find the hostages though until now no progress has been seen.
SNT.87398.6501	With the recent state of politics in Pakistan, it is becoming increasingly difficult for those who are providing humanitarian services.
SNT.12145.6502	Financial analysts say Google is planning an e-wallet service that could eventually compete with eBay's payment service PayPal.
SNT.12145.6503	The rumor is a first sign of Google's expected expansion of revenue sources to capitalize on its advertising customer base and search-engine traffic.
SNT.12145.6504	What form that expansion will take has been a hotly debated subject for the company whose stock valuation momentarily made it the world's biggest media company on June 7, 2005.
SNT.12145.6505	Even Microsoft has been mentioned as a possible future competitor.
SNT.12145.6506	Ebay's stock valuation dipped more than 2% on the news.
SNT.12145.6507	But one business analyst saw potential benefit for Paypal , depending on exactly how the "Google Wallet" takes shape.
SNT.12145.6508	The uncertainty underlined the lack of substantive information behind the rumor.
SNT.12145.6509	According to the New York Times, the CEO of a major online merchant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was approached by Google to take part in this service.
SNT.8774.6510	Having announced that Barry Prime would take over the newly created post of National Performance Director for swimming, Swim Ireland has revealed that the British coach has changed his mind about taking up the post.
SNT.8774.6511	Speaking from his home Mr. Prime told journalists "It is with regret that I had to inform the Swim Ireland Board of my decision not to take up the position of National Performance Director."
SNT.8774.6512	Barry Prime had agreed earlier this month to take over the post, but has changed his mind because he does not wish to move to Ireland from his current home in Australia.
SNT.8774.6513	He said, "I have realized that I do not wish to leave Australia and for that reason, and that reason alone, I will not take up the post."
SNT.8774.6514	The loss of Mr. Prime, a seasoned professional coach at the Australian Institute of Sport, is a major blow to Swim Ireland which has struggled in recent years to adapt to changes in international swimming.
SNT.142339.6515	Academy Award-winning film director Paul Haggis declared to Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis that he had decided to leave the Church of Scientology after being a member for 35 years.
SNT.142339.6516	His letter to Davis was posted Saturday on the blog of former high-ranking Scientology official Marty Rathbun.
SNT.142339.6517	Haggis received Academy Awards for writing and producing the 2004 film Crash, which he also directed.
SNT.142339.6518	Rathbun confirmed the authenticity of the letter by Haggis, and The Hollywood Reporter also confirmed it with a friend of the director.
SNT.142339.6519	At his blog, Rathbun has been critical of Scientology's current leader David Miscavige.
SNT.142339.6520	In the June article "Former Scientology executives say leader David Miscavige abused staff", Wikinews reported on criticism by Rathbun and other high-ranking officials that was published in a series of investigative articles in the St. Petersburg Times.
SNT.142339.6521	In his letter to Davis, Haggis wrote that he read the series in the St. Petersburg Times, where these former Scientology officials accused David Miscavige of physically abusing Scientologists.
SNT.142339.6522	He criticized the manner in which the Church of Scientology attempted to smear the former officials after they spoke out against the organization.
SNT.142339.6523	Well-known celebrity Scientologists include actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta.
SNT.142339.6524	Haggis had not been known to be a vocal public supporter of Scientology prior to his declaration to Davis that he was leaving the organization.
SNT.142339.6525	He expressed his disappointment to Davis, son of actress Anne Archer, that the San Diego, California branch of the Church of Scientology supported Proposition 8.
SNT.142339.6526	Proposition 8 removed the rights of same-sex couples to marry in California.
SNT.142339.6527	The San Diego Church of Scientology was listed along with other groups on a Proposition 8 supporters website, but it was later removed.
SNT.142339.6528	Haggis said that Davis initially told him he would do something about the San Diego Church of Scientology's support for Proposition 8, but in the end Davis did not take action about this.
SNT.142339.6529	Haggis called the inaction by Davis with regard to the San Diego Church of Scientology's stance on homosexuality "cowardly".
SNT.142339.6530	Actress Deborah Rennard, wife of Haggis, was introduced to Scientology by her parents.
SNT.142339.6531	According to Haggis, the Scientology practice of "disconnection" was imposed on Rennard and her husband, and they were ordered to disconnect from her parents because Rennard's parents had violated a rule of the organization.
SNT.142339.6532	Due to having undergone a personal experience with regard to Scientology's practice of disconnection, Haggis was surprised to hear Davis deny the policy existed in an interview with CNN journalist John Roberts.
SNT.142339.6533	He concluded his letter to Davis by noting that his Scientologist friends might disassociate from him due to his words, writing, "...I am fully aware that some of my friends may choose to no longer associate with me, or in some cases work with me."
SNT.142339.6534	I will always take their calls, as I always took yours.
SNT.142339.6535	However, I have finally come to the conclusion that I can no longer be a part of this group.
SNT.142339.6536	Frankly, I had to look no further than your refusal to denounce the church's anti-gay stance, and the indefensible actions, and inactions, of those who condone this behavior within the organization.
SNT.142339.6537	I am only ashamed that I waited this many months to act.
SNT.142339.6538	"I hereby resign my membership in the Church of Scientology."
SNT.142339.6539	Roger Friedman of The Hollywood Reporter described the film director's decision to leave the Church of Scientology as "a stunning move".
SNT.142339.6540	Friedman wrote that "Haggis has taken an enormous step here, and one that should resonate among all celebrity Scientologists."
SNT.142339.6541	Writing for Movieline, Kyle Buchanan characterized the letter by Haggis as "a candid, confrontational letter to Scientology top brass", and said "It's a must-read."
SNT.142339.6542	Radar Online observed "In a shock heard-round-the-Scientology world, Paul Haggis has very publicly quit the organization."
SNT.142339.6543	Foster Kamer wrote for Gawker that the letter by Haggis was "incredibly damning" to Scientology, and Adam McDowell of National Post called it "a scathing letter about church policy".
SNT.142339.6544	Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger called Haggis "the most famous name (if not face) to renounce the Church of Scientology", and Xan Brooks wrote in The Guardian that "the Church of Scientology lost one of its most high-profile members".
SNT.142339.6545	According to The Guardian, the Church of Scientology has not yet responded publicly to the statements made by Haggis in his letter to Davis.
SNT.142339.6546	Haggis has multiple credits in film, including work as writer-director for Crash, and writer for Million Dollar Baby (directed by Clint Eastwood), Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Letters From Iwo Jima.
SNT.142339.6547	Both Million Dollar Baby (2004) and Crash (2005) won Academy Awards for Best Picture, making Haggis the first film writer since 1950 to pen movies which won Best Picture Oscars in consecutive years.
SNT.142339.6548	He is highly-regarded for his work as a humanitarian and for his civil liberties work, and his letter includes a list of awards he has received related to his dedication to civil rights.
SNT.142339.6549	He is currently working on the film The Next Three Days, which includes actors Liam Neeson, Russell Crowe, and former Scientologist Jason Beghe.
SNT.142339.6550	Beghe previously went public with his own criticism after leaving the Church of Scientology, and described how members must pay large amounts of money to advance in Scientology levels.
SNT.43253.6551	The Australian Democrats deputy leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett moved in the Australian Senate a bill to amend the Marriage Act to provide for same-sex marriages.
SNT.43253.6552	Senator Bartlett's second reading speech which was incorporated into the Hansard described that the bill "reverses the Marriage Amendment Act 2004...which...changed the definition to that of a union between one man and one woman only", and refuted arguments against same-sex marriage proposed by some conservative Government senators.
SNT.43253.6553	Bartlett continued to say that "We do not want to send the message that discrimination is acceptable in Australia" to our children, or to other nations."
SNT.43253.6554	In an interview on June 8, Prime Minister John Howard said, "I don’t see it in any way as discriminating against homosexuals."
SNT.43253.6555	Debate on the bill will occur at a later date.
SNT.43253.6556	A bill proposed later in the sitting day by the Australian Greens to stop the Governor-General disallowing ACT state law establishing civil unions failed, by a majority of two votes.

SNT.31650.6594	Relatives and friends of the victims and survivors of the recent fire, as well as ordinary citizens were there and full of anger.
SNT.31650.6595	They had come to protest against the authorities, whom they say mishandled the rescue operation in the terrible fire and have withheld the truth about the real number of dead.
SNT.31650.6596	The slogans at the protest read, "Who will tell us the truth?", "We want to know the truth!", "Our lives cost nothing!", "Authorities should respond!", and "Firemen are those who should be set on fire!"
SNT.31650.6597	The Chief of Vladivostok City Police Department colonel Nikolay Panchenko commented: "The meeting participants are sure, that the authorities hide a true number of the dead and refer to the web-site fire.zloe.net."

SNT.120400.6605	Steele, 50, a former Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, won after the sixth round of voting against Katon Dawson of South Carolina.
SNT.120400.6606	Steele's candidacy was controversial as he was seen as being on the left of his party's base and had been a member of the Republican Leadership Council, an anti-social-conservatism movement.
SNT.120400.6607	He had denied being a moderate, telling CNN: "I'm proud to say I'm a conservative, have been, always will be."
SNT.120400.6608	In addition to the election of Barack Obama of the opposing Democrats in the presidential election of 2008, the Democrats gained eight seats in the Senate and 21 seats in the House.
SNT.120400.6609	He told the media that the Republicans have an image problem, being thought of as a party that is "insensitive, a party that is unconcerned about minorities, a party that is unconcerned about the lives and the expectations and dreams of average Americans."
SNT.120400.6610	According to the BBC, the Republicans are aware of not being able to reach the country's non-white population, a job made tougher by the Democrats having a very visible mixed-race leader in the White House.
SNT.120400.6611	When campaigning for the United States Senate in 2006, Steele had been a vocal critic of then-President George W. Bush.

SNT.120400.6614	The Republican National Committee develops and promotes the Republican Party's political platform and coordinates fundraising and election strategy.
SNT.120400.6615	Steele spent more than $200,000 on his Convention election campaign.

SNT.111906.6619	Rescuers feared that there would be more avalanches and decided to end the search for survivors in the late afternoon today.
SNT.111906.6620	The avalanche started at an elevation of 3,600 meters and went down the mountainside for nearly 100 meters, leaving a trail 50 meters wide.

SNT.114683.6640	Those injured were taken to the nearby PIMS and Holy Family hospitals.
SNT.114683.6641	The suicide bomber had convinced guards he was making a delivery of candy before taking his life and destroying much of the building.
SNT.114683.6642	The attack was only six miles from the Pakistani Parliament, where intelligence and military chiefs were briefing lawmakers on the campaign against terrorism.
SNT.114683.6643	Investigators suspect the involvement of a Bajaur-based militant group, Jaish-e-Islami Pakistan (JIP), whose commander was recently injured after an attack on its headquarters.
SNT.114683.6644	The suicide bomber had entered the office and placed a bag of 'sweets' on a desk, with a note threatening continued attacks if Pakistan continued to aid the US.

SNT.101539.6653	Almost exactly one year ago, on March 7, Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 crashed during landing at Adisucipto International Airport, near Yogyakarta, after a scheduled domestic Indonesian passenger flight.
SNT.101539.6654	21 people - 16 Indonesians and five Australians - were killed when the Boeing 737-400 overshot the runway, crossed a road, struck an embankment and burst into flames in a rice paddy.
SNT.101539.6655	Overall, the plane had traveled 252m beyond the extreme end of the runway.
SNT.101539.6656	The final report, released in October, blamed pilot error for the disaster.
SNT.101539.6657	The report stated that the aircraft had approached at a speed far exceeding that at which the wing flaps could properly operate, and attempted to execute a landing at 408 kph (254 mph), which is 160 kph (100 mph) above the safe speed.
SNT.101539.6658	It also found that captain Marwoto Komar had ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) informing Mr Komar that the aircraft was flying at a speed beyond that at which it could safely land, but he failed to abort.
SNT.101539.6659	It also commented that he missed one further opportunity for emergency evasive action when the airliner struck the runway and bounced into the air, at which point co-pilot Gagam Rochmana requested a 'go-around' procedure be initiated, but was also ignored.
SNT.101539.6660	It further criticised Mr Komar for singing during final approach, a direct violation of the Garuda Basic Operations Manual, which calls for activation of the Sterile Cockpit Rule at 10,000 feet and below.
SNT.101539.6661	Mr Rochmana was also criticised for his failure to take control away from Mr Komar when it became apparent that the aircraft was being operated in an unsafe manner.
SNT.101539.6662-1	However, the report did note that Garuda Indonesia had failed to give him any simulator training replicating a situation whereby the co-pilot would take over control duties from the pilot in charge due to unsafe handling of the plane.
SNT.101539.6662-2	 in fact, training was found to be inadequate for both members of the cockpit crew.
SNT.101539.6663	Further criticisms were also leveled at airport and governmental authorities for failures in their respective roles to provide safety features and to enforce regulations.
SNT.101539.6664	However, the Indonesian authorities have recently generated intense controversy by deciding to prosecute Mr Komar for his role in the disaster.
SNT.101539.6665	The move has been pushed for by some, but met with opposition by others.
SNT.101539.6666	Alexander Downer, Australian foreign minister at the time of the crash, immediately said "...I am very glad that they have reached a point now where they have charged the captain of the aircraft."
SNT.101539.6667	The unusually high number of Australians amongst the 140 passengers on board was attributable to a visit by Mr Downer.
SNT.101539.6668	One of those was Morgan Mellish of the Australian Financial Review, who died in the crash.
SNT.101539.6669	His sister, Caroline Mellish, had specifically called for prosecution to be avoided, saying "I think having 21 deaths on your conscience is probably enough."
SNT.101539.6670	"I don't think prosecuting the man is going to make any difference."
SNT.101539.6671	There were fierce calls for prosecution of both pilots immediately after the report's release, with Downer himself pressuring the Indonesian authorities, citing the "very credible report" and saying "I've asked our ambassador today (October 24) to make it absolutely clear to the Indonesians that we want people prosecuted for this accident."
SNT.101539.6672	"I want to see people who have negligently allowed Australians … to be killed."
SNT.101539.6673	Australian Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd also made clear a desire for prosecutions, saying he had telephoned secretary-general of Indonesia's foreign affairs department and former ambassador to Australia Imron Cotan, telling him that he wanted those responsible "prosecuted to the absolute full".
SNT.101539.6674	"This is a serious matter," he said.
SNT.101539.6675	National Transport Safety Committee chairman Tatang Kurniadi said at the time that no information from the report could be used in any criminal or civil liability investigations.
SNT.101539.6676	"I would like to go back to the objective of this", he said.
SNT.101539.6677	"If any institution wants to ... follow up that accident, that's their own decision."
SNT.101539.6678	"The report contained the results from the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, but according to international regulations on aviation these black boxes are not allowed to be used for... liability purposes."
SNT.101539.6679-1	"We will not give police or any institution (information) other than for safety purposes only."
SNT.101539.6679-2	"it's in international regulations and we want to follow those regulations."
SNT.101539.6680	He also confirmed that investigators cannot speak to the police, with the only permitted testimony under the legislation being to testify at a court hearing, and pointed out that the document does not actually appoint any blame.
SNT.101539.6681	The international legislation he was referring to is probably the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which stipulates that accident reports and related material, specifically transcripts of interviews, communications with crew and cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder (collectively known as black boxes) readouts, must not be used for any purpose other than determining the cause of an accident or incident.
SNT.101539.6682	The only possible exception to this is where potential benefit would outweigh the "adverse domestic and international impact" on the investigation in question or any other either in progress or in the future.
SNT.101539.6683	This legislation is in place to provide protection to witnesses on the basis that without it they may be less likely to cooperate with investigational procedures.
SNT.101539.6684	Aridono Sukman, the police member in charge of the criminal investigation, said that the contents of the black box were vital evidence.
SNT.101539.6685	Officials commented that some relatives had expressed their frustration over the legal challenges involved in the prosecution effort.
SNT.101539.6686-1	Early in February Mr Komar was arrested;
SNT.101539.6686-2	 he has subsequently been charged with manslaughter charges which carry a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment.
SNT.101539.6687	The London-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA) issued a press release condemning this move, saying that further investigations are needed into the crash, and that criminal proceedings could prevent an accurate version of events from ever being known.
SNT.101539.6688	Specifically, the release said that "IFALPA believes that the circumstances of the accident as set forth in the final report of the Indonesian investigation authority leaves many serious questions concerning the crew actions prior to the accident."
SNT.101539.6689	"Central to these concerns are the underlying reasons for the reported behavior of Captain Marwoto Komar."
SNT.101539.6690	"Experienced pilots have considerable difficulty in attempting to explain what is reported in the context of normal airline operations."
SNT.101539.6691	"The Federation believes that the explanations proffered by the report do not square with the collective experience of our members."
SNT.101539.6692	The release went on to state the opinion that prosecution may bring total foreclosure to the case and could only be counterproductive.
SNT.101539.6693	It also said "He remains a professional who was involved in an unfortunate tragedy."
SNT.101539.6694	One possible explanation had previously been suggested by the head of the Garuda pilots association, Stephanus Geraldus.
SNT.101539.6695	He said that marital problems between Mr Komar and his wife Norma Andriani were "common knowledge" and was backed up by an industry analyst and pilot who said he believed the couple had been arguing late into the night, and expressed concern that the report had not addressed psychological issues.
SNT.101539.6696	Mr Geraldus also said sleep deprivation could have contributed, with the flight crew reporting for duty at 4:30 am and the flight departing an hour and a half later.
SNT.101539.6697	The report had hinted at problems, saying "The pilot was probably emotionally aroused because his conscious awareness moved from the relaxed mode "singing"to the heightened stressfulness of the desire to reach the runway by making an excessively steep and fast, unstabilised approach,"
SNT.101539.6698	It is also known that Mr Komar had been under police surveillance, during which time he was receiving psychological treatment.
SNT.101539.6699	The Indonesian Pilot's Association has also said that the criminal prosecution should be avoided, arguing that the only people who can judge whether mistakes were made in aviation are those professionally involved and not the police.
SNT.101539.6700	There were protests in Jakarta demanding his release and dozens of pilots across the nation also campaigned.
SNT.101539.6701	Meanwhile, two survivors, Adrianus Meliala and Retno Gunowati, went to the House of Representatives (DPR) to challenge those opposed to legal processes against the pilot.
SNT.101539.6702	Mr Komar was released on police bail on February 15, and is currently awaiting trial.
SNT.101539.6703	He was forced to resign late in February with being fired his only alternative, and his licence has been suspended.
SNT.101539.6704	He is believed to be the only man ever prosecuted in Indonesian history over an airliner crash.

SNT.73263.6744	However, a survey by the Campaign for Real Ale suggests 840,000 people who do not regularly go to the pub would do so following the introduction of the ban and that England's 6.2 million regular drinkers would be more likely to visit pubs and bars.
SNT.73263.6745	Smoking kills 100,000 people in Britain each year through cancer, lung conditions, and heart problems.

SNT.153743.6747	Ringo Starr, who is a member of The Beatles, was given his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday.
SNT.153743.6748	The event, which was also celebrating fifty years since the pavement was founded, took place during the night for the first time.
SNT.153743.6749	Starr was the 2401st individual to have a star awarded on the walk.
SNT.153743.6750	The event also took place outside of the Capitol Records Building.
SNT.153743.6751	Starr said outside of the event: "This is the start of the next 50 years of stars."
SNT.153743.6752	According to Reuters," fellow Beatles bandmate Sir Paul McCartney was unable to attend the ceremony due to the fact that he was in England at the time", Starr said.
SNT.153743.6753	Less than twelve months before Ringo was given his star on the Walk of Fame, Paul McCartney assisted in revealing a star for another former Beatles member, the late George Harrison.
SNT.153743.6754	The late John Lennon was also given a star on the pavement, which means that Paul McCartney is now the only member of the Beatles who has not yet been awarded a star.
SNT.153743.6755	McCartney "[w]as selected and approved [for a star] many years ago."
SNT.153743.6756	"We are just waiting for his people to give us a date on when he would like to do it," according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce source.
SNT.153743.6757	The event was also partly to promote "Y Not", the drummer's recently released album.
SNT.153743.6758	"I don't know about you, but where I live."
SNT.153743.6759	He referred to the other members of the Beatles as his "brothers".
SNT.153743.6760	He also said about them: "They looked out for me, and I looked out for them."
SNT.60304.6761	The first large-scale trial of a vaccine for HIV has been launched in South Africa.
SNT.60304.6762	About 3,000 HIV-negative people will be administered the test vaccine MRKAd5 HIV-1 created by the pharmaceutical company Merck.
SNT.60304.6763	The study will examine if the vaccine prevents infection or lowers HIV levels in those who do get infected.
SNT.60304.6764	A parallel study will also be conducted in the United States and South America, to compare the vaccine's effectiveness on various strains of HIV.
SNT.60304.6765	The vaccine's functioning in a heterosexual population and its effectiveness among women will also be studied.
SNT.60304.6766	Preliminary trials for the vaccine have been conducted in the Americas and Australia as well as in Africa.
SNT.60304.6767	AIDS is estimated to have killed 25 million people worldwide since 1981, and between 33 and 46 million more are estimated to be infected with HIV, more than half of them in Sub-Saharan Africa.
SNT.60304.6768	Between three and six million people are thought to have been infected in 2005.
SNT.60304.6769	The trial, named the Phambili ("Going forward") Trial, is being conducted by the International HIV Trials Network and the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI).
SNT.60304.6770	The vaccine has been developed from an adenovirus, a type of virus that causes the common cold.
SNT.60304.6771	The virus has been genetically engineered to prevent it from causing the flu or from passing on from person to person.
SNT.60304.6772	Instead, three genes of the HIV virus have been introduced into the adenovirus.
SNT.60304.6773	When the vaccine containing these genes is injected into the body, it is hoped that the body's immune system will learn to recognise and kill cells that contain the vaccine, thereby also developing an immune response against the HIV virus, which also contains these three genes.
SNT.60304.6774	The three genes, called gag, pol and env contain information needed to make the structural proteins for the capsid, the "shell" of the HIV viron.
SNT.60304.6775	The vaccine does not contain the remaining six HIV genes that cause HIV to infect cells, replicate and cause disease.
SNT.60304.6776	"The vaccine does not contain any live HIV and therefore cannot cause any infection", SAAVI said in a press release, adding that the vaccine was found to be safe and produced an immune response against HIV in earlier trials.
SNT.60304.6777	SAAVI has expressed its commitment to the "highest level of preventive care" for those who take part in the trial, promising "extensive, state-of-the-art" counselling as well as some forms of medical care and for those taking part, through the duration of the trial.
SNT.60304.6778	The trial starts a week after a different trial, involving a microbicide gel called Ushercell was stopped after more women who used the gel were found to be infected compared to those who were given a dummy gel as placebo.
SNT.60304.6779	Eleven previous trials of the gel had not shown any problems.
SNT.60304.6780	The trial is expected to cost $35 million and SAAVI will be supported by Eskom and the South African government.
SNT.268917.6781	A United Nations court today convicted a woman, a former minister in the Rwandan government, for her role in the 1994 genocide in the ethnic war between the Tutsi and the Hutu peoples.
SNT.72531.6782	Gilad Shalit, 20, is believed to be alive, and Hamas has released an audio tape in which Shalit says he needs to be hospitalized and that he regrets that Israel has not met the demands of the kidnappers.
SNT.72531.6783	"I have been in prison for an entire year and my health is deteriorating."
SNT.72531.6784	"I regret the lack of interest of the Israeli government and military in my case and their failure to meet the demands."
SNT.72531.6785	"Just as I have parents, a mother and father, thousands of Palestinian detainees have mothers and fathers whose sons must be returned to them."
SNT.72531.6786	"I have a great hope from my government that it show more interest in me and meet the demands of the Mujahideen (kidnappers)," said Shalit on the audio tape.
SNT.72531.6787	Noam Shalit, Gilad's father says that he is "almost sure" that the voice on the tape is that of his son, but also states that "we cannot know when it was recorded."
SNT.72531.6788	"I imagine that it's the same as the letter they dictated to him and doesn't reflect his real state."
SNT.72531.6789	"We want somebody independent to see him, to examine him and the conditions under which he is held, his medical condition of course and his mental (condition)."
SNT.72531.6790	Israeli officials believe that the kidnappers told Shalit what to say during the audio recording and that the Israeli government will not cooperate with the group.
SNT.72531.6791-1	"How cruel can Hamas be? "
SNT.72531.6791-2	"We will not cooperate with Hamas."
SNT.72531.6792	"We will not compromise with Hamas," said Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
SNT.72531.6793	Hamas states that Israel had every chance to swap prisoners to release Shalit, but that Israel has to act.
SNT.72531.6794	"We have been flexible in every possible way when it came to a swap deal, but the Israeli side was too weak to make a decision."
SNT.72531.6795	"The ball is now in the Israeli court," said Osama al-Muzaini, a senior official for Hamas.
SNT.72531.6796	Shalit was kidnapped exactly one year ago today on June 25, 2006.
SNT.72531.6797	He was kidnapped in Gaza City which sparked a month long war between Lebanon and Israel.
SNT.43521.6798	Poland came from behind with two set-piece goals to beat Costa Rica in Group A, Tuesday.

SNT.43521.6800	Costa Rica left the 2006 World Cup without a victory in three games.
SNT.43521.6801	Though the pace of the game was rather slow in the heat the outcome did seem to matter to the two teams who both wanted a World Cup win.

SNT.3331.6812	As much as 200 mm (8") of rain have been recorded in portions of British Columbia, on the west coast of Canada since Monday.
SNT.3331.6813	The heavy and sustained precipitation across the lower mainland regions have caused mudslides and flooding, with roads and highways being closed and families evacuated.
SNT.3331.6814	In Port Coquitlam, a retaining wall burst, throwing concrete and rubble tens of metres and covering an arterial road with mud to a depth of two metres.
SNT.3331.6815	Further inland and north, where colder temperatures have prevailed, the precipitation has been falling as freezing rain and sleet, or heavy snowfalls.
SNT.3331.6816	Terrace, BC, was isolated as highways north and south of the city were closed due to a heavy glaze of ice.
SNT.3331.6817	The Trans-Canada Highway and most other roads through the mountains were closed due to heavy and sudden snow accumulations which created severe avalanche hazards.
SNT.3331.6818	"The avalanche danger is at high or extreme in all of our six forecast areas," according to John Kelly at the Canadian Avalanche Centre in Revelstoke.
SNT.3331.6819	"If the rain continues at the same magnitude and according to the forecast, then some of the rivers could reach flood stage either later [Tuesday] or Wednesday morning," said Allan Chapman, a hydrologist with the River Forecast Centre in Victoria.
SNT.3331.6820	The source of the wet weather is a large system reaching the coast from the Pacific Ocean tropics, a type of system nicknamed by meteorologists a "Tropical Punch".
SNT.3331.6821	A similar system caused severe flooding and precipitation in 2003.
SNT.3331.6822	Environment Canada expects the system, which lies southwest of Vancouver Island, to continue to develop "waves" of weather which will strike the mainland and head inland over the next several days to a week, possibly dropping 50-100 mm (2"-4") of additional rain per day at least until the end of the weekend.

SNT.74295.6829	The 17-year-old was allegedly planning to aid in the attack on the school.
SNT.74295.6830	The two teens were arrested and held in Long Island jail on misdemeanor conspiracy, which is punishable by up to one year in prison.
SNT.74295.6831	The 15-year-old will appear in juvenile court on Friday and the 17-year-old suspect is expected to plead not guilty at a hearing.

SNT.64692.6855	The Light Blues won with a time of 17 minutes and 49 seconds to record their first win in three years.
SNT.64692.6856	Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes and 2 seconds.
SNT.64692.6857	Oxford won the toss and chose to row on the Surrey side of the river, with Cambridge rowing on the Middlesex side.
SNT.64692.6858	Oxford had the stronger start and were ahead for much of the first half of the race.
SNT.64692.6859	They had a slight advantage over Cambridge at Hammersmith Bridge, where they would be favoured by racing the inside of the upcoming bend.
SNT.64692.6860	However Cambridge never lost touch and pulled ahead at Chiswick steps, maintaining their lead for the remainder of the race.
SNT.64692.6861	Before the race, Cambridge were strong favourites, being 9lb heavier per man on average.
SNT.64692.6862	The Cambridge crew had 5 returning blues compared to Oxford's one.
SNT.64692.6863	Furthermore the international achievement of Cambridge's rowers far exceeded that of Oxford: the World Champion stern pair of Germans Thorsten Engelmann (the heaviest ever oarsman at 110.8kg) and Sebastian Schulte, Olympic Gold medallist Kieran West MBE and GB medal winner Tom James.
SNT.64692.6864	The heavily fancied Cambridge crew did not win by the margin expected by many, thanks in part to a strong row from Oxford, and the sagging stern containing the heaviest Cambridge oarsmen.
SNT.64692.6865	Also of note, only a week before, Cambridge were victorious at the prestigious Head of the River Race (raced on the same course, but from Mortlake to Putney).
SNT.64692.6866	However the race was abandoned due to weather conditions with only 29 out of 420 crews finishing.
SNT.64692.6867	The race, first held in 1829, is currently held on a 6,779 m (4 miles and 374 yards) stretch of the River Thames in London from Putney to Mortlake.
SNT.64692.6868	Overall, Cambridge lead Oxford by 79 wins to 73 with one dead heat.
SNT.64692.6869	In the earlier race for reserve crews, Goldie (Cambridge) beat Isis (Oxford).

SNT.79026.6871	Four F3 Tornado fighter jets were launched by the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force to intercept Russian military planes.
SNT.79026.6872	The eight Russian jets were flying in airspace patrolled by Nato, officials from the UK claimed.
SNT.79026.6873	The long-range bombers were initially followed by Norwegian F16 jets, after Russia's recent decision to reinstate Cold War-style long-range patrols.
SNT.79026.6874	14 strategic bombers were flying on long-range patrol, according to Russia's Defence Ministry.
SNT.79026.6875	They also confirmed that none had approached a foreign state and had been shadowed by aircraft from Nato countries.
SNT.79026.6876	The Ministry of Defence in the United Kingdom released a statement that the Russian Tupolev Tu-95 Bear aircraft, flying in four loosed pairs, were tracked by Norwegian aircraft before entering Nato airspace on Thursday morning.
SNT.79026.6877	The UK currently holds responsibility for the Nato airspace, and launched four F3 Tornados from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, UK, to identify the bombers.
SNT.79026.6878	The bombers eventually left the Nato zone, under tracking by UK aircraft and RAF radar in Northumberland.
SNT.79026.6879	An MoD spokesman confirmed that Russia was entitled to its long-range patrols, adding 'The motivation behind any Russian military activity is a matter for the Russian government.'
SNT.79026.6880	Lt Col John Inge Oegland, spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, said there had been several similar incidents in recent months, but that the Russian flights were not causing alarm in Norway.
SNT.79026.6881	Relations between Britain and Russia have worsened recently, particularly after Russia's refusal to allow the extradition of a former KGB bodyguard suspected of murdering emigre Alexander Litvinenko in London last year.

SNT.145695.6888	Industry Canada announced today that the government, through the Privy Council Office, has effectively overturned a decision by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regarding the status of Globalive Wireless Management Corporation, which was set to launch in November under the WIND Mobile brand.
SNT.145695.6889	In a release issued this morning, Tony Clement, Minister of Industry is quoted as saying "Globalive is a Canadian company, and meets Canadian ownership and control requirements under the Telecommunications Act," differing with the CRTC's decision, where they ruled that control-in-fact of Globalive was with Cairo-based Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E., the corporation holding much of Globalive's equity and debt.
SNT.145695.6890	A decision had been rendered under Canadian Ownership and Control regulations by Industry Canada at the time of the Advanced Wireless Spectrum (AWS) auction held in 2007-2008, at which time they had ruled that Globalive did meet the tests of ownership and control under the same regulation, as referenced by the Order-in-Council included with the government's announcement this morning.
SNT.145695.6891	With the decision by the government, Globalive is now permitted to launch their wireless service, which is expected to occur in the Calgary and Toronto markets in time for the busy holiday shopping season.
SNT.145695.6892	"This holiday season we will start to provide Canadians with the competitive choice that they want and deserve," said Anthony Lacavera, Chairman and CEO of Globalive Communications Corporation, in a release sent out today.
SNT.145695.6893	Not everyone was quite as enthusiastic however, with Michael Hennessey, Senior VP of Regulatory and Government Affairs for TELUS Communications quoted as saying "If Wind is Canadian then so was King Tut," in a comment posted to Twitter, according to the CBC.
SNT.145695.6894	TELUS had led the charge in requesting the CRTC review the ownership structure of Globalive/WIND, and had received support from Shaw Communications, along with new entrant Public Mobile, all of whom were reported to have signed an open letter to Industry Minister Clement published in Parliament Hill newspaper The Hill Times upon the announcement that he would be reviewing said decision by the CRTC.
SNT.145695.6895	There is no word yet on whether TELUS or other carriers will attempt to appeal the ruling.

SNT.128397.6903	123 jobs are reported to be going in the Netherlands with the remainder from the United Kingdom.
SNT.128397.6904	Corus have blamed the move on the "further deterioration" of the demand for steel in both the United States and Europe.

SNT.54065.6920	As per tradition and local fame, effigies were carried through the town and burned on huge fires.
SNT.54065.6921	These include The Pope, Guy Fawkes and other unpopular figures.
SNT.54065.6922	One of this year's unfortunate guest appearances was also rendered as a hugely grotesque likeness of the U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
SNT.54065.6923	The unflattering effigy clutched a tattered U.S. flag in one hand, and a miniature Tony Blair in the other.
SNT.54065.6924	Smaller scale effigies, and so called 'enemies of bonfire', were also represented.
SNT.54065.6925	This year's enemies included British Transport Police, whose attitude and handling of Bonfire night is an issue of local contention.
SNT.54065.6926	Transport police were quietly represented by a pig head wearing a police helmet.
SNT.54065.6927	Six arrests occurred in respect of criminal damage and public order offences, but the event was less rowdy than in previous years and eras in the history of the Bonfire.
SNT.54065.6928	Superintendent Cliff Parrot of the Sussex Police said, "The event passed safely and was a resounding success with fewer arrests than last year, People were well behaved and acted responsibly, which in turn allowed everyone else to enjoy the celebrations."
SNT.54065.6929	The steep streets of the small town, located one hour south of London, were filled during the chilly winter evening with crowds carrying burning torches, with police, and with alcohol consumption accompanied by loud deafening bangs.
SNT.54065.6930	In addition to effigies, flaming crosses were carried in recognition of the town's 17 Protestant Martyrs.
SNT.54065.6931	These preceded elaborate costumed parades where participants dressed as Vikings, Antique firemen, Mongol warriors, and Zulus (including for the first time at Lewes, a female chieftain).
SNT.54065.6932	The pirates towed a cannon which they fired and shocked the crowds.
SNT.54065.6933	The traditional striped jerseys worn by various Bonfire Society members were also in evidence.
SNT.130108.6934	A plane carrying sixteen people has vanished over Papua, Indonesia.
SNT.130108.6935	The Twin Otter propeller-driven aircraft has a crew of three and thirteen passengers, two of whom are babies.
SNT.130108.6936	The plane, which belonged to Merpati Nusantara Airlines, was travelling from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, Papua to Oksibil, a town near the Papua New Guinean border.
SNT.130108.6937	The journey normally takes fifty minutes and only three hours and thirty minutes worth of fuel was on board.
SNT.130108.6938	Both transportation authorities and the military have launched bids to locate the missing plane, with at least two aircraft taking off to search for the aircraft.
SNT.130108.6939	However, poor weather conditions have forced these aircraft to return to land.
SNT.130108.6940	The plane was over a mountainous area covered with dense forest when air traffic control lost contact.
SNT.130108.6941	"We're focusing our search on the border between [the] Keerom and Pegunungan Bintang districts... it's a mountainous, jungly region," said air force commander Suwandi Miharja, who is in charge of the search.
SNT.130108.6942	Aircraft lost in this region have sometimes never been located after suspected crashes.
SNT.280096.6943	Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir announced the release of all journalists detained in the country's jails in an address to a gathering of journalists in the capital of Khartoum, on Saturday.
SNT.280096.6944	"I declare amnesty for all the journalists detained by the security authorities and their release," said Al-Bashir.
SNT.280096.6945	This came in the same month as the release of Abu Zar Al-Amin, deputy editor-in-chief of pro-opposition paper Ra'y Al-Sha'b.
SNT.280096.6946	Al-Almin had served a prison term of nearly two years after he violating press restrictions and reporting on alleged co-operation between Sudan and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
SNT.280096.6947	The release and amnesty follows a series of fresh violations of 'press freedoms', which resulted in the suspension of independent newspapers such as Al-Jaridah and Al-Ahdath on August 20 and 21.
SNT.280096.6948	According to Mozdalifa Mohamed Osman, Al-Ahdath's newsroom chief, the suspension caused financial losses of US$10,000.
SNT.280096.6949	No reasons were given for the suspension of the newspapers.
SNT.280096.6950	However, the editor-in-chief of AlJaridah, Saad Al-Din Ibrahim revealed that his paper was suspended because it did not allow the security services to interfere in its editorial and recruitment policies; sources believe the Al-Ahdath suspension was due to the publication of information on a planned meeting between President Al-Bashir and the leader of armed opposition group Sudan People's Liberation Movement (northern sector) Malik Aggar.
SNT.280096.6951	According to press-freedom watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the Sudanese government aggressively attacks journalists through "contrived legal proceedings, politicized criminal charges, and confiscations".
SNT.280096.6952	Press freedoms may deteriorate with the National Congress Party contemplating further restrictions, including the possibility of pre-publication censorship.
SNT.9692.6953	Today the 60th anniversary of Victory Day was commemorated in Russia, and other successor states of the Soviet Union.
SNT.9692.6954	The leaders of more than 50 countries and heads of several international organisations attended the parade.
SNT.9692.6955	George W. Bush watched the parade with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
SNT.9692.6956	More than 4,000 World War II veterans and 7,000 military personnel were involved in the parade.
SNT.9692.6957	The culmination was the flight of 12 planes (made up of SU-25s and MIG-29s), which emitted white, blue and red smoke to paint a Russian flag in the air.
SNT.9692.6958	Mass celebrations are planned to be held at Poklonnaya Gora, Moscow's primary WW2 memorial.
SNT.9692.6959	Several new monuments were opened today, such as the 8-meter statue of Charles de Gaulle by Zurab Tsereteli and the monument to soldiers from Allied countries.
SNT.9692.6960	The 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day was commemorated across Europe yesterday.
SNT.251075.6961	Faithless, an electronica band from the United Kingdom, have made the announcement that they are to separate at the end of their current tour.
SNT.251075.6962	Their current tour is expected to conclude at the O2 Academy, Brixton on April 8, 2011.
SNT.251075.6963	It consisted of three members, known as Maxi Jazz, Sister Bliss and Rollo Armstrong.
SNT.251075.6964	Insomnia, God Is a DJ and We Come 1 are amongst the most famous muscial works that have been released from Faithless.
SNT.42041.6965	Human rights group Amnesty International has released satellite images showing how the Zimbabwean community of Porta Farm, which once housed some 10,000 people, has been completely destroyed.
SNT.42041.6966	Taken in 2002 and 2006, the photos starkly contrast the previous built-up area with the empty scrubland that remains.
SNT.42041.6967	According to Amnesty International, residents of Porta Farm were given less than 24 hours notice to leave their homes.
SNT.42041.6968	Human rights monitors reported that several people died in the chaotic environment of the ensuing demolitions and forced evictions.
SNT.42041.6969	Zimbabwe's forced evictions programme (called Operation Murambatsvina) has been widely condemned both within Zimbabwe and beyond.
SNT.42041.6970	A 2005 report on Operation Murambatsvina by United Nations Special Envoy Anna Tibaijuka estimated that it has cost 700,000 people their homes or livelihoods.
SNT.42041.6971	She was present at Porta Farm during the second day of its demolition, and was shocked by the brutality of the evictions.
SNT.42041.6972	Residents of Porta Farm had fought eviction in the past, winning judgements from the High Court of Zimbabwe that they should not be evicted unless the government provided suitable alternative accommodation.
SNT.42041.6973	However the High Court dismissed a contempt of court action that attempted to stop the 2005 evictions, giving no reason.
SNT.42041.6974	The Zimbabwean government (led by President Robert Mugabe) says that the programme is in the public interest and was not against the law.
SNT.247914.6975	The Telecommunications Commission of the Solomon Islands (TCSI) have issued a fine to a Papua New Guinea (PNG) mobile phone provider, for failing to meet the deadlines set out in the terms of its license.
SNT.247914.6976	bemobile, the second mobile network service provider in the Solomon Islands, was supposed to have covered 50% of the Solomons by September 2010 and 75% by February 1st 2011.
SNT.247914.6977	The National Statistics Office and the TCSI investigated claims by bemobile that it had covered 64% of the Islands, but found the claims were incorrect.
SNT.247914.6978	As a result, the TCSI have now issued a fine of to the company for breaking its operating license.
SNT.247914.6979	This is the second time bemobile failed to meet its contractual obligations, and the Telecommunications Commissioner, Nicholas Williams, made it clear that they had fallen short of the target, despite being given time to sort the issue out.
SNT.247914.6980	Williams said, "TCSI has found that bemobile has failed to meet its third coverage threshold of 75% of the population that commenced on 1 February 2011, as well as during the 14-day rectification period that was provided for under the licence."
SNT.247914.6981	Commissioner Williams also stated he could have raised the fine to US$2.5M, but he hoped that bemobile would use the extra money to meet its September deadline.
SNT.247914.6982	In a statement to the Commission, bemobile admitted it had not built any new transmitter masts since the latter part of 2010.
SNT.52694.6983	The TADA court in Mumbai held four accused guilty of assisting Tiger Memon in smuggling arms and RDX that were used in the serial blasts.
SNT.52694.6984	Muzamil Umar Kadri, Khalil Ahmed Sayyed Nazir and Gulam Hafeez Shaikh were convicted of helping land RDX on the Shekhadi coast in February 1993, and also for tranporting weapons and possessing illegal arms.
SNT.52694.6985	Tulsiram Dhondu Surve, watchman of high security Wangani microwave tower in Raigad district, was found guilty of allowing Tiger's men to use government property for the purpose of loading arms into vehicles which then transported them to Mumbai.
SNT.52694.6986	CBI investigations also revealed that Surve had concealed 59 bags of explosives in his field, before handing them over to the bombers.
SNT.52694.6987	The watchman was convicted under Section 202 of the Indian Penal Code for "not informing authorities of the smuggling of arms and explosives despite having knowledge of the activities."
SNT.52694.6988	Judge Kode, however, acquitted Anant Bhoir, who had allowed his dumper to be used for disposing of RDX in the Nagla Bunder Creek.
SNT.52694.6989	The court said that Bhoir had not been aware that the sacks contained explosive material.
SNT.52694.6990	The court also ruled that Bhoir and his co-accused's confessions were inadmissible since they "appear to have been taken under duress."
SNT.100196.6991	Wikinews held an exclusive interview with James Burns, one of the candidates for the Libertarian Party nomination for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
SNT.100196.6992	Burns, the former chairman of the Nevada Libertarian Party, was asked if he thinks he has a good shot at winning the Libertarian nomination and ultimately the presidency.
SNT.100196.6993	He replied, "My chances of winning are not all in my hands."
SNT.100196.6994	"I shall do my best, but it comes down to what others will do."
SNT.100196.6995	When asked about America's shrinking middle class he said, "The economic policies of the US government are the cause our troubles."
SNT.100196.6996	"When I am President, the only economic policy I shall pursue is to be frugal with the funds of the United States."
SNT.100196.6997	Burns believes that the President "is not 'the leader of the free world,' rather....a person who attempts to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
SNT.146528.6998	Five Chinese nationals, identified as Lu Mingcheng (52), Wan Huilan (42), Chan Kwok Kwong (52), Ngan Chiu Kuen (42) and Ieong Chi Kai (52), were sentenced to death by firing squad for trafficking nearly eight tons of marijuana by sea.
SNT.146528.6999	The People's Court of the northern Quang Ninh Province made the sentence after a four-day trial, and confiscated 19,600 jeans used for smuggling, HK$1.5 million (278,262 Yuan, US$10,485) in assets.
SNT.146528.7000	The group were hired in April 2008 by individuals known by A Giai and A Tran to transfer the marijuana from Pakistan to Canada and were caught on May 12, 2008.
SNT.146528.7001	The seizure is one of the largest in Vietnam's history, a country with strict drug laws.
SNT.63718.7002	At Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, students are finding that popular MP3 players, such as Apple's iPod, are very convenient devices for listening to music at the gym, while traveling on foot, and in the car.
SNT.63718.7003	In a recent ad-hoc survey conducted by Wikinews contributor Darren Mar, 150 students were randomly pulled aside in the hallways of the university, and asked if they own an MP3 player.
SNT.63718.7004	94 of the 150 students (62.66%) did in fact own MP3 devices, most of who were found to be carrying it on them when questioned.
SNT.63718.7005-1	There was one simple follow up question for those who had a player: "If it were possible to have complete and safe control of the device on the steering wheel of a car, would you rather listen to your device, or the radio?" 
SNT.63718.7005-2	 There were three answers possible, yes, no or both.
SNT.63718.7006	Of the 94, 78 (82.98%) said yes, eleven (11.70%) said no, and five (5.32%) said both.
SNT.63718.7007	The reasons for those who would listen to their device were commercial free music, personalized choice of music, and complete control of what you are listening to.
SNT.63718.7008	This study was motivated by the new design of 2006+ model cars.
SNT.63718.7009	Many are being built with auxiliary jacks for the stock radio, allowing the driver to easily connect any audio playing device to the car's sound system with a simple 3.5mm plug.
SNT.63718.7010	What's more, cars in the upper price echelon are being built with (1) a custom made area in the dash for MP3 players (iPod's being the most popular), and (2) implementing audio device control right onto the steering wheel.
SNT.63718.7011	A good example of this is the Ford Fusion or the 2007 Lexus IS250: "The centre console input port allows an iPod, MP3 or Windows Media Audio player to be plugged into the IS audio system."
SNT.41713.7012	Seniors who haven't been credited with passing the California High School Exit Exam won't be getting diplomas when graduation ceremonies are held next month because the First District Appellate Court won't hear the court case about the test until July 25.
SNT.41713.7013	The attorney for the students suing to block use of the test says he still expects to prevail.
SNT.41713.7014	"This case is far from over," said Arturo Gonzalez, the lead attorney in Valenzuela vs. O'Connell, in which Liliana Valenzuela, a Richmond High School student, and others sued to block the state's use of the test as a graduation requirement, "We think there is a strong chance that students in the Class of 2006 will receive their diplomas, even if it is after commencement ceremonies."
SNT.41713.7015	"They have to stay in school and pass their classes."
SNT.41713.7016	On May 12, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman agreed with Gonzalez' argument that the state's use of the test as a graduation requirement was unconstitutional because poor and minority students don't have access to equal educational resources, and therefore don't have equal protection under the law.
SNT.41713.7017	He issued an injunction against the use of the test.
SNT.41713.7018	That injunction seemed to pave the way for those of the 47,000 seniors statewide who haven't yet passed the test, but have completed all other requirements, to receive diplomas with their classmates at upcoming graduation events.
SNT.41713.7019	But State Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell quickly filed an appeal of Freedman's ruling and asked the State Supreme Court to issue a stay of Freedman's injunction.
SNT.41713.7020	Earlier this week, the Court granted O'Connell's request for a stay, allowing schools to deny diplomas to students who haven't passed the test.
SNT.41713.7021	The Court also ordered the Appellate court to hear O'Connell's appeal of Freedman's ruling against the test.
SNT.41713.7022	On Thursday, Gonzalez petitioned the Appellate Court to expedite their hearing of the case to as soon as next week, but today the court denied Gonzalez' request and scheduled the case for a hearing on July 25.
SNT.41713.7023	In an email to the James Logan Courier, Gonzalez said he thinks his case is strong enough to withstand the appeal.
SNT.41713.7024	"We intend to vigorously defend Judge Freedman's ruling," he said, "The record strongly supports his decision."
SNT.41713.7025	"If the court of appeals upholds Judge Freedman's ruling, students in the Class of 2006 may still receive their high school diplomas," he said.
SNT.41713.7026	About 70 seniors at James Logan High School in Union City, Ca., mostly minorities and those who are learning English, still need to pass the test.
SNT.41713.7027	O'Connell, an avid defender of the test, which is required by a law he wrote and championed when he was in the state legislature, said this week that he would make sure school districts knew that they had to require the test be passed in order to hand out diplomas to students.
SNT.41713.7028	"I will communicate with districts today to ensure they are aware that the exit exam is a graduation requirement" he said, "Students who have worked hard to pass this exam will be given a diploma that signifies their mastery of essential skills in reading and math."
SNT.204805.7029	BP released their report into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster earlier this year on Wednesday, and shifted much of the blame for the explosion and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, onto , the company managing the rig.
SNT.204805.7030	The report concludes by stating that decisions made by "multiple companies and work teams" contributed to the accident which it says arose from "a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces."
SNT.204805.7031	The report, the product of a four-month investigation conducted by BP's Head of Safety Operations, Mark Bly, criticizes the oil rig's fire prevention systems, the crew of the rig for failing to realize and act upon evidence that oil was leaking from the surface of the ocean, and describes how BP and Transocean "incorrectly accepted" negative pressure test results.
SNT.204805.7032	The document goes on to note that the blow-out preventer failed to operate, likely because critical components were not operational.
SNT.204805.7033	Bob Dudley, who will become chief executive of BP, described the accident as "tragic".
SNT.204805.7034	He said, "we have said from the beginning that the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon was a shared responsibility among many entities."
SNT.204805.7035	"This report makes that conclusion even clearer, presenting a detailed analysis of the facts and recommendations for improvement both for BP and the other parties involved."
SNT.204805.7036	"We have accepted all the recommendations and are examining how best to implement them across our drilling operations worldwide."
SNT.204805.7037	The report included 25 recommendations, according to a press release, "designed to prevent a recurrence of such an accident."
SNT.204805.7038	The oil company has previously blamed Transocean and Halliburton, the well contractor, for the disaster and BP executives feel they have been unfairly blamed by US politicians for the disaster, and the report continues this view.
SNT.204805.7039	Tony Hayward, who was fired from the position of BP's chief executive following multiple public relations issues, squarely places the blame for the disaster on Halliburton.
SNT.204805.7040	"To put it simply, there was a bad cement job," he said in a statement, also claiming that BP should not be the only company to take the blame for the explosion.
SNT.204805.7041	"It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident," he argues.
SNT.204805.7042	The report blames the type of cement used by Halliburton, designed to prevent harmful hydrocarbons from reaching the seabed, as well as criticizing the crew of Deepwater Horizon, for failing to realize for forty minutes that oil had started to leak from the well, and once it was realized, the crew "vented" the hydrocarbons "directly onto the rig".
SNT.204805.7043	Describing how the explosion, which killed eleven rig personnel, occurred, the report states that "the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system probably transferred a gas-rich mixture into the engine rooms," where the hydrocarbons ignited and a fireball engulfed the rig.
SNT.204805.7044	But, the report states, the blowout preventer, the ultimate failsafe on the Deepwater Horizon failed, likely due to the fire on the rig.
SNT.204805.7045	An automated system was not operational because the batteries powering it, located in a control pod, had gone flat, and another control pod contained a faulty solenoid valve.
SNT.204805.7046	The report was likely, however, written with the company's legal liability for the disaster in a prominent position, since they are facing hundreds of lawsuits and criminal charges as a result of the spill.
SNT.204805.7047	The executive summary is four and a half pages long and the first page is made up entirely of legal disclaimers saying if BP was found to be negligent in their operations of the rig, they could be fined a good deal more.
SNT.204805.7048	Questions have also been raised as to why BP has chosen to release their report before authorities examine the blowout preventer.
SNT.204805.7049	The energy editor of The Guardian, Terry Macalister, wrote that the "catalogue of errors - both human and mechanical" in the report "demolish" the oil industry's "much quoted mantra" of safety first.
SNT.204805.7050	"It may come first in the board room but it does not down at the wellhead where the real dangers are faced," he wrote.
SNT.204805.7051	"It is worth remembering that BP, its rig operator Transocean and the main well contractor Halliburton are the blue chip companies in the wider oil and gas sector."
SNT.204805.7052	"If the shoddy work practices highlighted here are what the best-in-class do, then what is happening in the lower reaches of this industry?"
SNT.204805.7053	Transocean described the report as a "self-serving" attempt to "conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident: BP's fatally flawed well design."
SNT.204805.7054	"In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk - in some cases, severely."
SNT.204805.7055	In a statement, the company listed five issues they felt had contributed to the disaster that were no fault but BP's.
SNT.204805.7056	"Transocean's investigation is ongoing, and will be concluded when all of the evidence is in, including the critical information the company has requested of BP but has yet to receive."
SNT.204805.7057	Members of Congress, who are also carrying out a review into the disaster, also dismissed the report.
SNT.204805.7058	Ed Markey, the Massachusetts democrat who has been investigating the spill in Congress, said that he felt the report was simply a lengthy defense of the oil company's handling of the spill.
SNT.204805.7059	"BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece," he said.
SNT.204805.7060	Bly acknowledged during a press conference in Washington that the report did not detail the charges raised against the company in Congress and that BP permitted a culture of recklessness to flourish.
SNT.204805.7061	He did, however, reject suggestions that cost-cutting had put lives at risk and the rig was a disaster waiting to happen.
SNT.204805.7062	"What we see instead is, where there were errors made they were based on poor decision-making process or using wrong information," he said.
SNT.204805.7063	The Guardian reported that "the report is narrowly focused on the final days before the explosion rather than on earlier decisions about well design and safety procedures."
SNT.204805.7064	"No BP officials have been sacked for their role in the explosion, and Bly said there was no indication of any blame beyond the well-site managers."
SNT.204805.7065	The Associated Press reported that Bly "said at a briefing in Washington that the internal report was a reconstruction of what happened on the rig based on the company's data and interviews with mostly BP employees and was not meant to focus on assigning blame."
SNT.204805.7066	"The six-person investigating panel only had access to a few workers from other companies, and samples of the actual cement used in the well were not released."
SNT.204805.7067	The report continued, "Steve Yerrid, special counsel on the oil spill for Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, said the report clearly shows the company is attempting to spread blame for the well disaster, foreshadowing what will be a likely legal effort to force Halliburton and Transocean, and perhaps others, to share costs such as paying claims and government penalties."
SNT.204805.7068	Head of Greenpeace's energy campaign Jim Footner said that it was "highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP."
SNT.204805.7069	However, he said, "the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk."
SNT.204805.7070	"The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now."
SNT.204805.7071	"The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy."
SNT.204805.7072	Alfred R Sunsen, whose oyster company operating in the Gulf of Mexico is facing the prospect of going out of business after 134 years, reacted angrily the the report.
SNT.204805.7073	"The report does not address the people, businesses, animals, or natural resources that have been impacted by the disaster and will be dealing with the consequences of their inadequate and slow response to the disaster," he said.
SNT.204805.7074	The New York Times said that the report is "unlikely to carry much weight in influencing the Department of Justice, which is considering criminal and civil charges related to the spill," and described it as "a public relations exercise" and a "probable legal strategy as it prepares to defend itself against possible federal charges, penalties and hundreds of pending lawsuits."
SNT.204805.7075	Wayne Pennington, head of the geological engineering department at Michigan Technical University, also alleged that BP was wrong to blame other parties involved with the disaster.
SNT.204805.7076	"The blowout and subsequent explosion and spillage appear to the result of an overall attitude that encouraged unwarranted optimism in the quality of each component of the job, allowing the omission of standard testing procedures, and the misinterpretation of other tests in the most-favorable light."
SNT.204805.7077	He continued: "Instead, skepticism should reign on any drilling job, and testing and evaluation at each stage of the drilling and completion would then be routine; instead of questioning the need for such things as the cement bond log, the companies involved should insist on checking and double-checking quality at each step of the process."
SNT.204805.7078	"This was clearly not done, repeatedly, in the case of the Macondo well, and disaster resulted."
SNT.204805.7079	4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries.
SNT.204805.7080	Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades.
SNT.204805.7081	Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface.
SNT.204805.7082	The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.

SNT.204805.7084	"We have sought throughout to step up to our responsibilities."
SNT.204805.7085	"We are determined to learn the lessons for the future and we will be undertaking a broad-scale review to further improve the safety of our operations."
SNT.204805.7086	"It will be incumbent on everyone at BP to embrace and implement the changes necessary to ensure that a tragedy like this can never happen again."

SNT.140236.7104	75 people, mainly women and children, were aboard the vessel when it flipped over during a storm.
SNT.140236.7105	They had been returning from a fair that marked the end of the Durga Puja, an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga.
SNT.140236.7106	Fifteen people were able to swim to safety, but it is unlikely the other passengers of the boat were able to survive, according to a report.

SNT.125235.7114	Norm Coleman filed an appeal with the Minnesota Supreme Court challenging opponent Al Franken's court victory last week which gave Franken a 312-vote lead in the disputed 2008 Minnesota United States Senate election, reports the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.
SNT.125235.7115	The basis for Coleman's appeal has yet to be given and will be included in a legal brief to be filed by the Coleman campaign later this week.
SNT.125235.7116	Jim Langdon, lawyer for the Coleman campaign, said that the oral arguments in the court could begin in anywhere from "two weeks to two months", adding more time to a process which has continued since a razor-thin difference between the two candidates' vote totals triggered an automatic recount in November 2008.
SNT.125235.7117	The Supreme Court is not required to hear oral arguments and it is possible they could refuse to hear the case.
SNT.125235.7118	A spokesperson for the Franken campaign says that Coleman is up to the "same old, same old."
SNT.125235.7119	"Sometimes you come up on the short end of a close and bitter election."
SNT.125235.7120	"But at some point, you have to accept the reality for what it is," said Marc Elias, one of Franken's lawyers.
SNT.125235.7121	The Coleman campaign argues that 4,400 ballots from Coleman-leaning districts have improperly not been counted, while some undetermined number of ballots (perhaps contributing up to 100 of Franken's 312-vote margin) were accidentally double-counted.
SNT.125235.7122	Coleman also argues that 132 ballots from the Dinkytown neighborhood of Minneapolis should not have been counted, since the envelope containing them was lost or stolen after the machine count and before the recount.
SNT.125235.7123	The Franken campaign, meanwhile, supports the previous three-judge panel (from a Democrat, a Republican, and an Independent) unanimous ruling giving Franken victory.
SNT.125235.7124	The Franken campaign, anticipating a final victory and certification by the Minnesota Secretary of State, has begun hiring a staff for Franken's senatorial office.
SNT.125235.7125	Franken's spokespeople say he is going to start by hiring Alana Peterson, a former state director for Representative Jim Oberstar, as state director.
SNT.1002218.7126	On Friday, the sheriff of Pickens County, South Carolina Rick Clark refused to lower the flag to honor Nelson Mandela after US President Barack Obama made an executive order that all US flags to be flown at half mast in honor of Mandela until sunset today.
SNT.1002218.7127	On Friday, Clark posted to Facebook to explain his decision saying, "I usually don't post political items, but today is different."
SNT.1002218.7128	"I received this notification today, 'As a mark of respect for the memory of Nelson Mandela, the President orders that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff effective immediately until sunset, December 9, 2013' ".
SNT.1002218.7129	He went on to say in the same post, "Nelson Mandela did great things for his country and was a brave man but he was not an AMERICAN!!! The flag should be lowered at our Embassy in S. Africa, but not here."
SNT.1002218.7130	Our flag is at half staff today for a Deputy in the low country who died going to help his fellow Deputy.
SNT.1002218.7131	"I have ordered that the flag here at my office back up after tomorrow's mourning of Pearl Harbor Day!"
SNT.1002218.7132	According to Fox News, the US President cannot require US flag lowering at the local level.
SNT.1002218.7133	According to CNN in an article published yesterday, presidents generally restrict requests for lowering the flag to major national figures, US governors, and foreign dignitaries.
SNT.1002218.7134	Presidents of the United States have previously ordered the flag lowered in honor of non-Americans including Pope John Paul II who died in 2005, King Hussein of Jordan who died in 1999, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who died in 1995, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat who died in 1981, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who died in 1965, and United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold who died in 1961.

SNT.53810.7136	An annual survey done by the New Zealand Consumers' Institute has shown that there has been a dramatic decline in satisfaction with the respondents' Internet service providers (ISP).
SNT.53810.7137	Of the over 10,000 Internet users who participated in the survey, only 66% said they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their current ISP.
SNT.53810.7138	This is compared to the 2005 survey which was at 82%.
SNT.53810.7139	The reason, according to the Consumers' Institute, is because of national ISP, Xtra dragging down the ratings.
SNT.53810.7140	Only 55% of Xtra's customers said they were satisfied or very satisfied with Xtra, it was 78% last year.
SNT.53810.7141	Nick Brown, spokesman, said: "Xtra will be working to improve its ranking."
SNT.53810.7142	The best ISP, as voted by the survey respondents, was Inspire, the third consecutive time they have won.
SNT.53810.7143	97% of Inspire's users said that its performance was either good or very good.
SNT.53810.7144	David Russel, chief executive of the Consumers' Institute, said: "The wonderful world of cyberspace has a long way to go in New Zealand in terms of providing customer satisfaction."
SNT.53810.7145	Providers must sharpen up on their advertising and improve the performance of their service desks.
SNT.53810.7146	"Broadband speed and the price people are paying are the biggest bones of contention."
SNT.53810.7147	Mr. Russell added: "Support, both online and offline is a key factor in satisfaction with your ISP."
SNT.64397.7148	According to a recent interview, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards is said to have snorted his late father's ashes mixed with cocaine.
SNT.64397.7149	In an interview with the NME magazine he is quoted as saying "The strangest thing I've tried to snort? My father."
SNT.64397.7150	He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow.
SNT.64397.7151	My dad wouldn't have cared, he didn't give a shit.
SNT.64397.7152	Despite the interview, Richards denies he said anything like that and that he ever used cocaine.
SNT.64397.7153	"I wouldn't take cocaine at this point in my life unless I wished to commit suicide."
SNT.64397.7154	The truth of the matter is that I planted a sturdy English Oak.
SNT.64397.7155	Bert, who had been the father of Richards, died when he was 84, back in 2002.
SNT.64397.7156	Richard's manager later told the NME that the remarks had been made "in jest", and should not be taken seriously.
SNT.322932.7157	Speaker of the U.S. House John Boehner announced yesterday that he would agree to a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut.
SNT.322932.7158	In an effort to end the impasse between the House and Senate, Boehner told Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid that he would schedule a House vote on the Senate version of the bill that would extend the tax cut, which was due to expire at the end of the year.
SNT.322932.7159	Speaker Boehner announced the agreement in a brief statement: "Senator Reid and I have reached an agreement that will ensure taxes do not increase for working families on January 1".
SNT.322932.7160	Boehner informed other congressmen of the deal in a conference call yesterday evening.
SNT.322932.7161	The House may pass the bill via unanimous consent today, which would not require the presence of all members.
SNT.322932.7162	Boehner and Reid also agreed to a bipartisan negotiation committee to sort out differences and extend the tax cut for an entire year, a goal recently sought by Republicans in the House.
SNT.322932.7163	The extension of the payroll tax cut, which would prevent approximately 160 million Americans from seeing a tax increase in 2012, had already been passed by the Senate last weekend.
SNT.322932.7164	Earlier yesterday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell joined several other Republican Senators in encouraging the House to pass the extension.
SNT.322932.7165	Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said that once the House acts, he "will be happy to restart the negotiating process to forge a yearlong extension."
SNT.322932.7166	At a news conference, Speaker Boehner issued a statement: "We have fought the good fight."
SNT.322932.7167	"Why not do the right thing for the American people even though it's not exactly what we want."
SNT.322932.7168	President Obama also responded to the development in a statement: "This is good news, just in time for the holidays."
SNT.322932.7169	This is the right thing to do to strengthen our families, grow our economy, and create new jobs.
SNT.322932.7170	"This is real money that will make a real difference in people's lives."
SNT.322932.7171	The tax cut extension impasse began when the House effectively rejected the Senate-approved version of the bill on Tuesday after being faced with opposition from House Republicans, specifically those associated with the Tea Party movement, who advocated for spending cuts and the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline.
SNT.55354.7172	An ongoing struggle in Kazakhstan between the authorities and a local Hindu village has turned serious.
SNT.55354.7173	Forum 18 has been documenting the alleged human rights abuse regarding the Hare Krishna village for some time, but as of 21st November events took a drastic turn.
SNT.55354.7174	The following was seen and written by Ninel Fokina, president of the Almaty Helsinki Committee, and Andrei Grishin, official member of the International Bureau of Human Rights and Law Observance:
SNT.55354.7175	On November 21, 2006 at 1 pm the information was received that according to the court decision to evict the members of the religion organization International Society for Krishna Consciousness from the occupied land near Sri Vrindavan Dham farm, and the demolition of 13 country houses will begin immediately.
SNT.55354.7176	Heavy equipment was brought to the suburban community: trucks, demolition machines, three busses with riot policemen, a bus with demolition squad and the local authorities including the Hakim.
SNT.55354.7177	Electricity was disconnected in the morning of the same day.
SNT.55354.7178	She had a conversation with B. Baikadamov, the only person she could reach at that time, who promised to communicate to the Committee of Religious Affairs at the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court, and the Court Administration Committee which includes the department of court decision execution.
SNT.55354.7179	At 3 pm representatives of human rights organizations: Ninel Fokina, Andrei Grishin, and Maxim Varfolomeev, press-secretary of the Society for Krishna Consciousness, plus, a journalist and representative of Astana TV channel left for the village which is located 40 km from Almaty.
SNT.55354.7180	All the roads to village were closed and patrolled by police.
SNT.55354.7181	The human rights representatives and the journalist took detour through the fields.
SNT.55354.7182	It was snowing, but they were able to reach the border of the village because of the four-wheel-drive jeep they were traveling in.
SNT.55354.7183	The jeep was not allowed to drive into the village.
SNT.55354.7184	When Grishin and the jeep driver tried to pass by walk they were stopped and threatened to be put in handcuffs.
SNT.55354.7185	Lieutenant colonel, who came with another patrol car, explained that they are not allowed to the village for their own safety.
SNT.55354.7186	He said that at that time the electric line was being dismounted in the area.
SNT.55354.7187	The driver of the jeep had his wife and two months old daughter in the village.
SNT.55354.7188	He was begging to let him go through, but his request was denied.
SNT.55354.7189	He was told that safety is guaranteed to his family.
SNT.55354.7190	They approached it from the other detour road, and leaving the car on the sidewalk, one by one they entered the village.
SNT.55354.7191	As they approached the village they met two small groups of young people who were not drunk but unnaturally exited.
SNT.55354.7191-1	They held hammers, big dumb-bells, metal crow-bars and sticks.
SNT.55354.7192	Two of them politely greeted the group, and one said gaily, "Your houses are finished."
SNT.55354.7193	Four big busses with toned windows and two cars of ambulance were parked at the entrance of the village in the grove.
SNT.55354.7194	30-40 policemen stood by the houses, and 20-30 people in civil clothes including the leaders of the district with the Hakim, the head of local executive authority stood on the street, watching the demolition.
SNT.55354.7195	Residents’ household stuff such as mattresses, blankets, utensils cookware, and furniture were laying outside on the lawns by their houses.
SNT.55354.7196	People in construction outfits (labor people) got inside the houses and started crushing windows and doors, destroying walls.
SNT.55354.7197	The bulldozer was demolishing the buildings and the big stone fencing with cast iron openwork lattice which separated the houses from the driving area.
SNT.55354.7198	A small group of inhabitants (20-30 people, mostly women) did not offer physical resistance.
SNT.55354.7199	One of the women felt dizzy, fell down and was picked up by the ambulance.
SNT.55354.7200	Police was bringing down those few (basically women) who tried to interfere with the destruction of their property.
SNT.55354.7201	Two men tried to prevent the entrance of destroyers into a house, but were brought down by 15 policemen who twisted their hands and took them away to the police car.
SNT.55354.7202	During all these events none of the representatives from the Office of Public Prosecutor were present at the place of the event, even though both Krishna people and legal service people demanded meeting with representatives of the Office of Public Prosecutor who are obligated to be present during this type of actions.
SNT.55354.7203	The Hakim of the Yetisu district who was personally responsible for this action noticed A. Grishin photographing the destruction of the houses using a digital camera and commanded the policemen to detain him.
SNT.55354.7204	A. Grishin is an officer of the Human Rights Bureau and a journalist.
SNT.55354.7205	To avoid confiscation of the camera A. Grishin tried to escape.
SNT.55354.7206	He ran away by 200 meters and was caught by the police.
SNT.55354.7207	Police officers confiscated his digital camera and took away his journalist certificate.
SNT.55354.7208	Then he was let free, but police refused to return the camera, saying that they would give it to the Hakim.
SNT.55354.7209	The camera was indeed found in the car of the Hakim, but the flash card and the batteries were confiscated.
SNT.55354.7210	When Grishin approached the Hakim to find out for what reason his camera and his journalist ID were confiscated, the Hakim told in front of the witnesses, “If I see you here again, I will personally crash Your eyes, even though I am the Hakim.”
SNT.55354.7211	No one of the policemen, who took part in the camera and ID confiscation, wanted to reveal their names.
SNT.55354.7212	The envoy of human rights E. Baikadamov, who was also contacted, said that the president of the Court Administration Committee Z. Makashev confirmed that he would contact immediately the provincial department and would give the appropriate instructions.
SNT.55354.7213	All the attempts of the representatives of the human rights organizations to find the people in charge of the operation and give them any information were unsuccessful.
SNT.55354.7214	All the present officials refused to speak and declared that they were not responsible for the action.
SNT.55354.7215	The OSCE representatives in Almaty Eugenia Benigni and Lisa Zhumakhmetova did not make it to the village.
SNT.55354.7216	When the darkness fell, at around 6 pm, everything was finished: 13 houses destroyed, people thrown to the snowbound street, the village left without electricity, without heat and water.
SNT.55354.7217	The condition of the witnesses can be described as shock.
SNT.55354.7218	The condition of the people who were thrown from their destroyed houses to the dirt and snow cannot be described.
SNT.55354.7219	 When all the 13 buildings were destroyed as was planned ... while the adjacent houses of other people who do not belong to the Society for Krishna Consciousness were left untouched even though their title deeds have the same status ... the bailiffs decided to give an interview to the TV channel “to avoid one-sided opinion.” 
SNT.55354.7219-1	However no one of them introduced himself.
SNT.55354.7220	The only thing they could say, “we are executing the court decision.”
SNT.55354.7221	Neither the Hakim, nor the police chiefs, nor the bailiffs would listen to the arguments that the governmental commission established to solve the issue around the Society for Krishna Consciousness has not yet come to final decision.
SNT.55354.7222	Notice: the notifications of eviction and demolition of the 13 houses owned by members of the cottage cooperative, who are the members of the religious organization Society for Krishna Consciousness, were delivered to the watchman of Sri Vrindavan Dham in the evening of November 20.
SNT.55354.7223	The date of execution and the period for evacuating the buildings were not stated.
SNT.55354.7224	It should be noted that the acting Kazakh law does not stipulate such a kind of eviction as the demolition of houses, and the eviction should be accompanied by the inventory of property removed from the evacuated building, while the storage of this property should be provided is necessary.

SNT.195165.7238	Australia's Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, has cut Singapore and the UK from her official winter trip, keeping only France on her schedule, due to expectations that Prime Minister Julia Gillard will arrive at Government House in the coming days to request the Governor-General to call an election.
SNT.195165.7239	There has been much speculation as to when Gillard was to request that the election be called by the Governor-General, with 21st and 28th of August being most likely.
SNT.195165.7240	This would be the first time since 1987 that an election was held during the winter.

SNT.79267.7249	Talks have been stalled due to disagreements between the European Union and United States over subsidies and tariffs for the agricultural sector.
SNT.79267.7250	A plan by the United States to establish an APEC free trade zone received a mixed reception with some members believing that such a move would weaken the group's commitment to the Doha round.

SNT.150457.7295	Microsoft has reported a profit increase of 60%, attributed to the widespread success of its new operating system, Windows 7, the fastest-selling operating system ever.
SNT.150457.7296	Net profit for the last three months of last year is $6.66bn, compared to $4.18bn for the last three months of 2008.

SNT.170288.7308	Mumtaz Zareen, Timargarah police chief, told AFP news agency that the attack was a suicide bombing; according to him, "the man came on foot and detonated himself."
SNT.170288.7309	The Awami National Party (ANP), the predominant political party in North West Frontier Province had organized the celebrations because of their decision to rename the province to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
SNT.170288.7310	"Our party had arranged a thanksgiving day to celebrate the changing of the name after 200 years of colonial legacy," he said to a private news agency.
SNT.170288.7311	According to Haji Mohammad Adeel of ANP, the Talibans had "lost the battle" and were executing such "cowardly" attacks "out of desperation."
SNT.170288.7312	This attack was followed by a triple attack in Peshawar by suspected Islamist insurgents.

SNT.143365.7328	British mercenary Simon Mann was released from a jail in Equatorial Guinea after being pardoned for attempting to overthrow the government.
SNT.143365.7329	Mann, along with several dozen other suspected plotters, was arrested five years ago on charges of trying to start a coup to overthrow president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.
SNT.143365.7330	Their plans were foiled, however, and Mann was arrested after arriving in Zimbabwe to purchase firearms and grenades.
SNT.143365.7331	The conspirators had planned to install exiled opposition leader Severo Moto as president and to gain control over the country's vast oil supplies.
SNT.143365.7332	The government said that the decision was made on compassionate grounds, seeing as Mann, aged 57, was reportedly not in good health.
SNT.143365.7333	It stated that Mann had "shown sufficient and credible signs of repentance and a desire to take his place in society."
SNT.143365.7334	Amnesty was also given to four other co-conspirators, among them Nick Du Toit, from South Africa.
SNT.143365.7335	Mann was arrested along with 63 others in 2004 when his plane landed in Zimbabwe allegedly to collect arms bought from the country's state arms manufacturer.
SNT.104176.7336	After admitting to price fixing on cargo services between Japan and the United States, Japan Airlines (JAL) has been fined US$110 million by the United States Department of Justice.
SNT.104176.7337	Prosecutors allege JAL earned $2 billion illegally between 2000 and 2006, although it is possible the scheme was operating as early as 1995.
SNT.104176.7338	British Airways, Korean Air and Qantas all previously admitted being involved and paid fines.
SNT.104176.7339	The cartel, which created artificially high prices by eliminating competition between its members, was exposed by whistleblower Lufthansa, who alerted authorities in exchange for immunity to prosecution.
SNT.104176.7340	JAL is the biggest carrier in Japan and the biggest carrier of cargo between Japan and the US.
SNT.104176.7341	Japan will not take any further action against the carrier.
SNT.104176.7342	The investigation was performed by two US groups, the FBI and the Department of Justice.
SNT.506849.7343	Witnesses heard gunshots in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Cedar Park, Texas, near Highway 183, on Sunday morning.
SNT.506849.7344	Four, including the gunman who had facial wounds unrelated to the shooting, are being treated for injuries after the incident.
SNT.506849.7345	Cedar Park Police Captain Mike Harmon said authorities arrived at the parking lot around 4:30 AM local time.
SNT.506849.7346	There they arrested Onwukaife, who has been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
SNT.506849.7347	The Cedar Park Wal-Mart was closed down briefly on Sunday morning; however, no staff or customers were injured.
SNT.506849.7348	Police have released the names of the victims, eighteen-year-old Cody McGrath, nineteen-year-old Shayne Davis, nineteen-year-old Zacharia Gietl and 22-year-old Leland McGlocklin.
SNT.506849.7349	As-of Monday, Gietl has been released from hospital whilst the others remain in critical, but stable, condition.
SNT.506849.7350	Police informed media the incident occurred follwing a dispute which began at a nearby party where alcohol was being served.
SNT.506849.7351	After moving the fight to the parking lot, Onwukaife is alleged to have shot the four victims.
SNT.506849.7352	Onwukaife was expected to be released on Monday, after which he would immediately be jailed.
SNT.506849.7353	Police advised media the investigation is on-going and more charges may still be filed.
SNT.506849.7354	Specifically, Police are trying to determine if any other participants in the fight were armed.
SNT.142047.7355	The murder rate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico has become the highest in the world.
SNT.142047.7356	There were an average of seven killings every day for the past twelve months in the city, which is currently in the midst of a clash between two powerful drug cartels.
SNT.142047.7357	The majority of the 1,986 murders this year remain unsolved, and most involve drug gang members who have come from elsewhere to fight for control of the drug smuggling route into neighbouring El Paso, Texas, as well as the lucrative local trade in drugs.
SNT.142047.7358	There is a jump of 815 murders from last year.
SNT.142047.7359	107 women, 85 children, and 49 police officers are among the dead and many people have met particularly violent ends.
SNT.142047.7360	One man was tethered between two trucks and ripped apart; others have been decapitated or dismembered.
SNT.142047.7361	The violence results from a turf war between rivals Juarez cartel and Sinaloa cartel, the latter being run by the most wanted man in the country, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
SNT.142047.7362	In late 2006 authorities launched a crackdown on Mexican drugs cartels, with Ciudad Juarez receiving 45,000 troops during that time.
SNT.142047.7363	However, this has failed to prevent the gangs battling to control the cocaine-smuggling trade run from the city.
SNT.89039.7364	This year Israel turns sixty and it has embarked upon a campaign to celebrate its birthday.
SNT.89039.7365	Along with technology writers for Slate, PC Magazine, USA Today, BusinessWeek, Aviation Weekly, Wikinews was invited by the America-Israel Friendship League and the Israeli Foreign Ministry to review Israel’s technology sector. 
SNT.89039.7366	It's part of an effort to 're-brand the country' to show America that there is more to Israel than the Palestinian conflict.
SNT.89039.7367	On this trip we saw the people who gave us the Pentium processor and Instant Messaging.
SNT.89039.7368	The schedule was hectic: 12-14 hours a day were spent doing everything from trips to the Weizmann Institute to dinner with Yossi Vardi.
SNT.89039.7369	On Thursday, the fifth day of the junket, David Saranga of the foreign ministry was able to arrange an exclusive interview for David Shankbone with the President of Israel, Nobel Peace Prize recipient Shimon Peres.
SNT.89039.7370	For over an hour they spoke about Iranian politics, whether Israel is in danger of being side-lined in Middle Eastern importance because of Arab oil wealth, and his thoughts against those who say Israeli culture is in a state of decay.
SNT.89039.7371	Shimon Peres spent his early days on kibbutz, a bygone socialist era of Israel.
SNT.89039.7372	In 1953, at the age of 29, Peres became the youngest ever Director General of the Ministry of Defense.
SNT.89039.7373	Forty years later it was Peres who secretly gave the green light for dialogue with Yassir Arafat, of the verboten Palestine Liberation Organization.
SNT.89039.7374	It was still official Israeli policy to not speak with the PLO.
SNT.89039.7375	Peres shares a Nobel Peace Prize with Yitzak Rabin and Arafat for orchestrating what eventually became the Oslo Accords.
SNT.89039.7376	The "roadmap" that came out of Oslo remains the official Israeli (and American) policy for peace in the Palestinian conflict.
SNT.89039.7377	Although the majority of Israeli people supported the plans, land for peace was met with a small but fiery resistance in Israel.
SNT.89039.7378	For negotiating with Arafat, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shouted at Peres, "You are worse than Chamberlain!" a reference to Hitler's British appeaser.
SNT.89039.7379	It was during this time of heated exchanges in the 1990s that Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a Jew who thought it against Halakhic law to give up land given by God (Hashem).
SNT.89039.7380	Peres is the elder statesman of Israeli politics, but he remembers that he has not always been as popular as he is today.
SNT.89039.7381	"Popularity is like perfume: nice to smell, dangerous to drink," said Peres.
SNT.89039.7382	The search for popularity, he goes on to say, will kill a person who has an idea against the status quo.
SNT.89039.7383	Below is David Shankbone's interview with Shimon Peres, the President of Israel.
SNT.24382.7384	OpenOffice.org today released version 2.0 of their free software office suite.
SNT.24382.7385	This release marks over three years of continuous development and boasts many features over version 1.0 which was released in May 2002.
SNT.24382.7386	The latest release may be downloaded from the OpenOffice.org web site free of charge.
SNT.24382.7387	The suite is intended to be a replacement for Microsoft's popular office suite, containing near-identical functionality without the price tag.
SNT.24382.7388	Site administrators from OpenOffice.org say the suite has been downloaded an average of over 400,000 times per week from the official site alone.
SNT.24382.7389	When taking into account that the suite is freely redistributable, and that it is distributed with many versions of GNU/Linux, the total number of copies in distribution is larger still.
SNT.24382.7390	One of the reasons for its significant popularity is the inclusion of several features not found in competing office suites, including in-built export to the PDF format and compatibility with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems.
SNT.24382.7391	Distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, the OpenOffice.org office suite can be run, studied, modified, and redistributed by anybody that receives a copy.
SNT.24382.7392	This means that any person, group, or company can publish an alternative version - which makes problems such as vendor lock-in impossible.
SNT.24382.7393	It also guarantees that the development will roughly follow with the wants of the userbase - instead of just the business model of one company.
SNT.24382.7394	A lot of work has gone into making this release more visually compatible with the look of Microsoft Office on computers running Windows XP, however, some users were not happy with the effects these changes had on the look of OpenOffice.org when using a dark theme (colour settings).
SNT.5639.7395	An angry Judge Rodney S. Melville threatened to issue a bench warrant for the arrest of world famous pop singer Michael Jackson if he failed to appear at the Santa Barbara County Superior Court in California Thursday Jan. 10, 2005.
SNT.5639.7396	Jackson is under indictment there on seven counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14, and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent.
SNT.5639.7397	Jackson, held briefly under the threat of jail by authorities on Nov. 20, 2003 when charges brought against him were formalized, gained his freedom later that day by posting a $3 million bail.
SNT.5639.7398	Judge Melville, apparently frustrated with Jackson who had in two earlier instances caused delays in his court room, issued the warrant just 5 minutes after noting the singer’s conspicuous absence at the scheduled 8:30 a.m. proceedings.
SNT.5639.7399	Jackson's defense lawyer, Tom Mersereau Jr., advised the judge that Jackson awoke earlier that morning with severe back pain and was under treatment at an area hospital at the time.
SNT.5639.7400	The judge moved to give the celebrity one hour to appear or face arrest for contempt of court.
SNT.5639.7401	As word of the warrant threat traveled to the large news presence gathered outside, a media countdown began.
SNT.5639.7402	During the countdown, live televised reports recounted how Jackson had arrived for court 20 minutes late on his own arraignment for these charges, only to be met by a stern lecture from Judge Melville for that transgression.
SNT.5639.7403	There was also another occasion where Jackson, while recovering from flu symptoms, delayed the trial's jury selection for a week until he was well enough to return.
SNT.5639.7404	The glaringly clear message sent by the judge was: bad back or not, Jackson was to appear in court! And fast! Only the televised scene of Jackson's expectant defense lawyer Mersereau with his assistant Susan Yu, both busy on cells phones while tensely waiting curbside beside the court house for the Jackson motorcade, seemed to undermine a feeling that Jackson would make it in time to avoid having his bail revoked.
SNT.5639.7405	As the deadline came and passed without Jackson’s arrival, live reports were busy with speculation on the superstar persona of Michael Jackson then taking on newer aspects of super-bizarre.
SNT.5639.7406	But Jackson’s flair for tardiness showed itself with an arrival that was a mere 3 minutes after the judge was being forced to make good on his threat.
SNT.5639.7407	Dressed in a blue blazer over a light weight undershirt, the star's recent departure from the hospital was evident by the pajama bottom pants and open-heeled bedroom slippers he wore into the court room.
SNT.5639.7408	Jackson had the assistance of his father and a body guard at each side to keep him steady as he gingerly walked into the Santa Maria court house.
SNT.5639.7409	He listed slightly to the right and kept a fixed, distant face that was surrounded by uncombed strands of his long hair.
SNT.5639.7410	The summons issued by the judge forced Jackson from his hospital bed to show the world he was not above the law.
SNT.5639.7411	In private chambers, Judge Melville met with both the prosecution lawyer, Tom Sneddon, and Jackson’s defense lawyer to verify the defendant’s claims of back pain.
SNT.5639.7412	After re-taking the bench in the court room, the judge announced to the jury they would proceed with the docket as planned.
SNT.5639.7413	Mr. Jackson narrowly escaped prison, and the trial would continue where it left off on the previous day with direct testimony from the now 15 year old boy who accuses him.
SNT.62031.7414	Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a visit to Hamilton yesterday to watch the 2007 annual Tim Hortons Brier at the Copps Coliseum.
SNT.62031.7415	Harper, who is currently writing a book about the history of Hockey, admitted he's a curling fan.
SNT.62031.7416	He started to be a fan of curling in Winnipeg, Manitoba 10 years ago and said his father used to play it.
SNT.62031.7417	"I've never curled but my father did when I was very young," he said.
SNT.62031.7418	About the last decade or so I've made an effort to get to the Brier when I could.
SNT.62031.7419	"I've obviously got a soft spot for Kevin Martin and Alberta because he's had such a great career," said Harper.
SNT.62031.7420	"But what's so great about the Brier is whoever wins is not like your normal pro athlete."
SNT.62031.7421	She wore a large crown and was draped in gold.
SNT.62031.7422	She got to meet the PM and was quoted saying: "Not a lot of people get to meet a prime minister."
SNT.149645.7423	Authorities have said that 48 whales near Christchurch, New Zealand were beached yesterday.
SNT.149645.7424	Fifteen of them died, although the other 33 were re-floated out to sea, according to a conservation official.
SNT.149645.7425	The pilot whales beached themselves at Port Levy on South Island, but dozens of volunteers helped to try and get them back out to the open water out of the inlet, which is muddy and shallow.
SNT.149645.7426	An alarm was called out at about 06.30 local time.
SNT.149645.7427	This is the third mass stranding on the country's coast this summer; 125 pilot whales died in the two other beachings earlier, and another 43 were re-floated out to the ocean.
SNT.149645.7428	"It's a very, very shallow bay in Port Levy, very muddy, so whether they were chasing food and got caught in the shallows, we don't know," remarked department community relations manager Grant Campbell to the Associated Press.
SNT.149645.7429	"We thought everything was OK, we checked them in the boat and then we woke up this morning and saw a whole lot on the beach here."
SNT.149645.7430	Campbell also commented that the whales were up to five metres (seventeen feet) long, and some of the calves were between a metre and a metre and a half (three to five feet) long.
SNT.149645.7431	"We really just stood with them and as the tide came in and started floating, we were just able to push them out and away they went," said a local, Ted Haowden, as quoted by United Press International.
SNT.149645.7432	Locals are expected to bury the dead whales this afternoon.
SNT.149645.7433	According to Campbell, autopsies will be performed on two of the fifteen dead whales.
SNT.149645.7434	Whales are frequently stranded on the beaches of New Zealand each summer, as they travel en route from Antarctica to breeding grounds.
SNT.226750.7435	A 55-year-old unidentified male died Saturday after his silver Peugeot motor vehicle collided with a red and white articulated truck and tanker on the A15 road.
SNT.226750.7436	According to the Humberside Police, the road traffic accident happened on the A15 near the small village of Hibaldstow, North Lincolnshire at approximately 0739 UTC on Saturday.
SNT.226750.7437	Although the sole occupant of the Peugeot was fatally injured, the occupant of the lorry was uninjured.
SNT.226750.7438	A spokesperson stated: "Officers would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision or the vehicles prior to the collision."
SNT.226750.7439	An investigation has begun to try to establish whether the icy and snowy weather conditions were a factor in this collision.
SNT.226750.7440	The police have commented that it is too early to know whether the weather conditions were a factor in this crash.
SNT.50624.7441	Shinzo Abe took 66% of the vote in today's Liberal Democratic Party election for a leader to replace Junichiro Koizumi, whose term as party chief expired.
SNT.50624.7442	The party, with a solid majority in the House of Representatives, is expected to elect Abe to be the next Prime Minister.
SNT.50624.7443	Abe is a third-generation politician related to two former Prime Ministers.
SNT.50624.7444	The election comes on the day before his 52nd birthday.
SNT.50624.7445	He is expected to become the nation's first Prime Minister born after World War II.
SNT.50624.7446	"The LDP has helped make Japan a democracy that has contributed to the world," Abe said after the vote.
SNT.50624.7447	"I will demonstrate my leadership to preserve the flame of ideals, and put reforms forward as the first party leader from the postwar generation."
SNT.5733.7448	A rather unimpressive Dublin side narrowly beat an even less impressive Westmeath side last night in front of a capacity (10,000) crowd at Dublin's Parnell Park to bag two points in the Allianz NFL Division 1A match.
SNT.5733.7449	The first half included a succession of poor wides by Dublin's forwards, but Westmeath failed to capitalise on the mistakes of their opponents, finishing the half with just three points.
SNT.5733.7450	The second half was a slightly better contest with a sudden burst of energy by the Westmeath forwards producing several points to bring the game back to level pegging at 0-8 to 0-8.
SNT.5733.7451	However with several chances squandered and consistently poor passing, Westmeath fell two points behind in the final few minutes of the game.
SNT.100527.7452	The European Union (EU) competitions commission has announced its decision to fine the Microsoft Corporation €899 million (US$1.35 billion), approximately 1/10th of the company's gross yearly earnings, for failing to comply with the 2004 antitrust order.
SNT.100527.7453	It is the highest ever fine charged by the EU (also being the largest fine of its kind ever imposed upon a company), and the first time that the EU has fined a company because of non-compliance with an antitrust decision.
SNT.100527.7454	The first decision in this antitrust case was given in 2004 citing that Microsoft withheld needed interoperability information from rival software companies which prevented them from making software compatible with Windows.
SNT.100527.7455	Microsoft agreed to this, providing the information for royalty fees of 6.5% of the licensee's revenues for the product on grounds of innovation (specifically, 3.87% for the patent license and of 2.98% for the information license).
SNT.100527.7456	The EU found these royalty fees unreasonable and Microsoft was ordered to lower them.
SNT.100527.7457	Microsoft complied with this, adjusting the royalty rates to 1.2% (changing the rates for the licenses to 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively) in the European Union, while keeping the rate the same for the rest of the world.
SNT.100527.7458	 The EU still saw this as an unreasonable rate, and Microsoft, two month after lowering the rates, reduced the rates yet again to a flat rate of €10000 or a royalty of 0.4% applicable worldwide. 
SNT.100527.7459	Microsoft's royalty rates, which were deemed unreasonable for the period of 15 months between June 21, 2006 and October 21, 2007 are the cause for the fine.
SNT.100527.7460	So far, the EU has fined Microsoft €1.68 billion in 3 separate fines in this case. 
SNT.100527.7461	This fine will go towards the European Union annual budget.
SNT.100527.7462	The European Anti-trust commissioner Neelie Kroes stated that the fine was "reasonable and proportionate", as the figure could have gone up as high as €1.5 billion, the maximum that the EU commission can impose. 
SNT.100527.7463	She also said that it should act as "a signal to the outside world, and especially Microsoft, that they should stick to the rules" and that "Talk is cheap."
SNT.100527.7464	Although she also expressed hope that "today's decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft's record of non-compliance with the Commission".
SNT.100527.7465	There is no certainty whether Microsoft will appeal this decision, a Microsoft Spokesperson has stated that Microsoft will review this latest fine, citing that "The commission announced in October 2007 that Microsoft was in full compliance with the 2004 decision, so these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved."
SNT.100527.7466	Microsoft's General Counsel Brad Smith commented "It's clearly very important to us as a company that we comply with our obligations under European law."
SNT.100527.7467	"We'll study this decision carefully, and if there are additional steps that we need to take in order to comply with it, we will take them."
SNT.100527.7468	Microsoft had appealed to fines by the EU before, but all the charges were defeated.
SNT.100527.7469	If Microsoft does not appeal the decision, the company will have 3 month (starting February 27th) to pay the fine in full.
SNT.100527.7470	Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stated that the company had news that the fine was pending.
SNT.100527.7471	"We didn't know it was this week, but we knew it was coming at some point."
SNT.100527.7472	This may not be the end of Microsoft's troubles with the European Union yet, as the commission is currently investigating two other complaints about the company's anti-competition practices.
SNT.100527.7473	The decisions came after Microsoft announced they were disclosing 30,000 pages of previously secret software code last Thursday (February 21st).
SNT.100527.7474	The EU competition commissioner's commented that this move "does not necessarily equal a change in business practice."
SNT.100527.7475	Microsoft was set to launch three new products: Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 at its "Heroes Happen Here" event today.
SNT.100527.7476	Microsoft shares slipped 12 cents to $28.26 on NASDAQ after news of the fine.
SNT.42853.7477	The National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum exhibit, Prix de West, opened yesterday and will exhibit 313 paintings and sculptures by contemporary western artists from Oklahoma.
SNT.42853.7478	All exhibit pieces will remain on display until September 10 and will be available for sale at a fixed-price this weekend.
SNT.42853.7479	The total value of the works on display is approximately $4.1 million.
SNT.42853.7480	Today, during the exhibition's banquet, the museum is to present Bob Kuhn with their lifetime achievement award.
SNT.42853.7481	Over 50 pieces of his work is being featured in a special exhibit at the museum.
SNT.42853.7482	For more information, visit the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum website.
SNT.24774.7483	In an industrial relations conference in Melbourne this week, Minister Kevin Andrews has released that the government's new industrial relations (IR) legislation is likely to be introduced sometime next week in the Australian lower house.
SNT.24774.7484	The Senate employment committee will hold an inquiry into the legislation.
SNT.24774.7485	According to Mr Andrews this inquiry will probably run for a week in the non-sitting period of parliament.
SNT.24774.7486	He said the legislation would then be debated in the Senate in the last sitting weeks of the year.
SNT.24774.7487	The new workplace reforms have evoked widespread controversy from both sides of the political spectrum.
SNT.24774.7488	The Australian Council of Trade Unions launched TV advertisements to counter the government's new legislation.
SNT.24774.7489	The 100 million dollar 'Work Choices' advertisements by the Australian Government has been criticised as a political use of taxpayers dollars.
SNT.24774.7490	Prime Minister John Howard has contended that the new reforms are necessary to keep our economy competitive and update outdated laws.
SNT.24774.7491	The opposition says a new class of working poor will be created in Australia under the planned IR changes.
SNT.24774.7492	One proposed change will deny Centrelink welfare payments to anyone who refuses a job, no matter what the conditions.
SNT.24774.7493	"For an individual the best form of welfare they can have is to have a job".
SNT.24774.7494	"What we will end up with is people being forced onto inferior wages, inferior conditions and the great risk is that we end up with a working poor just as you find in the United States,"
SNT.24774.7495	Michael Raper, spokesperson for the National Welfare Rights Network says it is a severe penalty.
SNT.24774.7496	"We've been trying to draw attention to the fact that any unemployed person will have to accept whatever conditions they're offered because if you reject a job offer you will lose Centrelink payments for eight weeks," he said.
SNT.24774.7497	The University of Sydney has released a report card on the changes available.
SNT.62056.7498	On Saturday, the French Constitutional Council announced its approval for a proposed law that would make it illegal for anybody other than professional journalists to videotape acts of violence.
SNT.62056.7499	The law is, as the Associated Press dubs it, a "clumsy effort" to curb the urban youth activity known as happy slapping in which an act of violence, such as kicking a helpless victim, is filmed by the attacker's friends for entertainment purposes.
SNT.62056.7500	The new law was tucked inside a much larger anti-crime bill put before the Council, and has been chastised for being "deliberately" vague and allowing the prosecution of non-guilty parties who simply videotape events of police brutality, urban riots or other violence.
SNT.62056.7501	Under the new legislation, written by Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy, convicted "citizen journalists" could face up to five years in prison.
SNT.62056.7502	Media freedom group Reporters Without Borders has called the act "dangerous", and warned that it can be used to target "regular citizens" who film acts of violence.
SNT.62056.7503	The group has also attacked proposed French legislation that would designate certain media outlets as "government-approved sources of information", citing the dangers of censorship.
SNT.8195.7504	The U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed on Wednsday the nomination of Dr. Michael Griffin to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), making him the 11th administrator of the US-based space agency.
SNT.8195.7505	He takes office at a time when NASA is busy with preparations for the return to flight of the space shuttle Discovery, expected sometime during the launch window of May 15 through June 3, 2005.
SNT.8195.7506	The presidential nominee Griffin was the head of the Applied Physics Laboratory's Space Department at Johns Hopkins University, a position he held almost a year.
SNT.8195.7507	Prior to that, he was a chief engineer at NASA before coming over from service as Deputy for Technology at the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization.
SNT.8195.7508	Griffin was critical at times of U.S. priorities in space exploration by questioning its continued commitment to the International Space Station.
SNT.8195.7509	Griffin, in testimony before the House Science Committee in 2004, outlined more ambitious plans for human exploration and settlement of the solar system in which he believes the United States should play a key role.
SNT.8195.7510	In a statement during his April 12, 2005, confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, Griffin said, "In the twenty-first century and beyond, for America to continue to be preeminent among nations, it is necessary for us also to be the preeminent spacefaring nation," with a spirit of discovery similar to the exploration of the New World by Columbus with the support of the Spanish crown.
SNT.8195.7511	Griffin, 55, notably holds seven academic degrees from various institutions, including a bachelor's degree in physics; master's degrees in aerospace science, electrical engineering, applied physics, civil engineering and business administration; and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland.
SNT.52431.7512	Lake effect snow has come early to parts of Western New York prompting a State of Emergency and a flood watch to be issued, especially in Buffalo, New York and its suburbs where nearly 2 feet of snow fell during the afternoon and last night.
SNT.52431.7513	Snow started to fall at around 12:00 pm EST on Thursday, October 12, heavy at times, and accompanied by thunder and lightning.
SNT.52431.7514	A driving ban has been issued for Tonawanda, New York, Buffalo and Amherst where at least "80% of roads in Amherst are impassible."
SNT.52431.7515	The New York State Throughway, or interstate 90 is closed from nearly Rochester, New York to Dunkirk, New York which is nearly 110 miles long.
SNT.52431.7516	Motorists at the Williamsville, New York toll barrier are being turned around.
SNT.52431.7517	A driving ban remains in effect while a state of emergency exists.
SNT.52431.7518	Water will be shut off in 24 hours due to the lack of electricity to water pumps in the area and in a press conference, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown issued a "boil water advisory."
SNT.52431.7519	Brown also said that "70,000 of the 75,000 residents and businesses in Amherst are still without power."
SNT.52431.7520	Residents are asked to bottle water and prepare for the outage.
SNT.52431.7521	It is not known when water will be turned back on.
SNT.52431.7522	At least 3 people have been killed due to the storm.
SNT.52431.7523	Two of those people were killed in a two-car accident in Lancaster, New York, and the other person was in Niagara County and died after being hit by a vehicle.
SNT.52431.7524	One person was crushed and killed by a falling tree in Amherst, while in the process of removing snow from his property.
SNT.52431.7525	Hundreds of trees have snapped in half as the snow began to fall around the city.
SNT.52431.7526	Many trees, which still have their leaves, have broken into pieces as the heavy, wet snow began to pile up, as much as an inch an hour.
SNT.52431.7527	Early on Thursday, the airport had received nearly 9 inches (23cm) of snow and climbing.
SNT.52431.7528	The storm has caused many delays and cancellations in flights leaving from or going to Buffalo.
SNT.52431.7529	Nearly 400,000 people in Buffalo and surrounding suburbs are still without power and forecasters at the NOAA are warning people "not to go outside in an area where heavy snow has fallen unless absolutely necessary."
SNT.52431.7530	Power may not be restored to the affected areas until Sunday and possibly next week in some areas.
SNT.52431.7531	Damage to trees is extensive with nearly every tree destroyed on Granger Place in Buffalo.
SNT.52431.7532	"This was extremely heavy snow and most of the trees still have most of their leaves ... we can't do a complete damage assessment until the snow stops falling," said spokesman for Niagara Mohawk, Western New York's area power company, Steve Brady.
SNT.52431.7533	"At 8 pm [on Thursday], utility companies were reporting over 50,000 customers without power."
SNT.52431.7534	"The reason for the widespread power outages has been the combination of very heavy water laden snow accumulating on the trees that still have most of their leaves."
SNT.52431.7535	"Tree's limbs break under the weight of the snow and bring down power lines as they fall," said a statement on NOAA's website.
SNT.52431.7536	Many business and nearly every school in Western New York are still closed due to the weather and the snow is forecasted to move south again over the Buffalo Metropolitan area, but snow amounts are not expected to be significant.
SNT.52431.7537	Wind is expected to be strong and gusty which could bring down tree limbs which are broken but still attached to the tree.
SNT.52431.7538	Some areas could see an additional 6 inches of snow by Saturday morning.
SNT.145224.7539	Iranian authorities have released five British yachtsmen who were detained last week in the Persian Gulf.
SNT.145224.7540	A statement from Iran's Revolutionary Guards said that, after investigation, it reached the conclusion that their illegal entry was a mistake.
SNT.145224.7541	Britain's Foreign Office confirmed the release, and said the yachtsmen are being towed to international waters, and were expected to head to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
SNT.145224.7542	Iranian naval forces detained the Britons on the 25th of November as they sailed from Bahrain to Dubai for a race.
SNT.145224.7543	The chair of Sail Bahrain, Andrew Pindar, which owns the yacht, said the vessel "may have strayed inadvertently" into Iranian waters due to a problem with its propeller.
SNT.145224.7544	State radio quoted a statement by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards as saying that "after getting necessary guarantees, Iran released the five."
SNT.145224.7545	"We reached the conclusion that they entered Iran’s territorial waters by mistake." 
SNT.145224.7546	The news comes hours after British Foreign Secretary David Miliband spoke to his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki by phone and pressed him for clear information on the incident.
SNT.145224.7547	He said the incident has "nothing to do" with politics or Iran's nuclear program.
SNT.9122.7548	The first thing to catch my eye when I approached what used to be a Texeco gas station, was a guy up in a man-lift beside the pump price sign.
SNT.9122.7549	Seeing heavy equipment being used to change what I thought were the gas prices, I thought, "Gawds, these prices are getting out of hand!"
SNT.9122.7550	After stopping in later and talking with the owner, I was impressed by how elated he was on the subject of bank processing fees.
SNT.9122.7551	The man-lift I saw earlier is absent from the photograph I took.
SNT.9122.7552	They had used the lift to change the pump price sign from Texaco to Shell.
SNT.212563.7553	A 21-year-old Swedish man killed himself and broadcast it over the internet via his webcam feed Monday, after posting to a message board that he had swallowed some painkillers and was going to hang himself.
SNT.212563.7554	At 11:51 a.m. Central European Summer Time (0951 UTC), Marcus Jannes, a student from Järna, Stockholm, posted to the Mental Health Problems forum of Sweden's Flashback message boards using the newly-registered username "LurifaxFlux", stating that he was going to hang himself, adding that he had already swallowed 100mg of dexofen and 1500mg of paracetamol.
SNT.212563.7555	He said that he had set up a webcam to record the event, and would post details later of a FTP server for people to watch.
SNT.212563.7556	Some offered messages of hope, such as, "How bad can it be? When everything is at its worst, it can only get better", and "Think of poor people, mutilated people, people who are lame or blind."
SNT.212563.7557	"They can not change their lives! But you still have the ability to alter yours!" 
SNT.212563.7557-1	Others tried to keep him online by talking to him empathetically: "Is there anything that can make you change your mind?", "Tell me about yourself."
SNT.212563.7558	However, other users posted messages saying they didn't believe him, wishing him luck with his attempt, and calling him an attention whore and a troll.
SNT.212563.7559	They also goaded him by saying, "you won't dare, you are too cowardly", and offering advice on the best way to hang himself: "I recommend ... you do it from a height that you can jump off so you are guaranteed to break your neck."
SNT.212563.7560	In a later post, Jannes said that he had been feeling suicidal for about six months, but was too scared to actually attempt anything until he tried to strangle himself with his own hands.
SNT.212563.7561	In response to questions, he stated that he was using a network cable to strangle himself because he didn't have any rope, but he was worried that the cable would not be strong enough to take his weight.
SNT.212563.7562	He also told them that he had Asperger syndrome and High-functioning autism, and was emotionally vulnerable and lacked normal social skills.
SNT.212563.7563	He admitted to feeling lonely, and alluded to experiencing problems at school, but admitted that he had a good upbringing and had a rather good life.
SNT.212563.7564	At around the same time, he also updated his Facebook status to say life was "just too difficult", and that he was going to kill himself.
SNT.56727.7565	The New Zealand Department of Corrections is currently investigating allegations at the Rimutaka prison in Wellington, New Zealand.
SNT.56727.7566	The prison guards have allegedly accepted monetary bribes from prisoners in exchange for drugs and cellphones.
SNT.56727.7567	Two former officers, Ingrid and Mark Rijniers, have handed over a collection of documents on their encounters while working at Rimutaka prison.
SNT.56727.7568	The pair, who were transferred from Holland, claim that Rimutaka prison is run by gang members who dominate the prison guards.
SNT.56727.7569	They also claim that if the gang members don't get what they want they will intimidate and threaten the guards with their lives.
SNT.56727.7570	However, Ingrid Rijniers is refusing to co-operate with the department because they refused to give her the money to return to Holland.
SNT.56727.7571	The New Zealand Corrections Department says it is taking these claims seriously but has not yet found sufficient evidence to back up the claims.
SNT.56727.7572	Simon Power, justice and corrections spokesman for the National party, said that the allegations are appalling and reflect heavily on the Corrections Department.
SNT.56727.7573	Mr Powers said that Barry Matthews, chief executive of the Department of Corrections, does not know what is happening in his prisons.
SNT.56727.7574	"That means the Minister, Damien O'Connor, will be equally clueless."
SNT.56727.7575	Twelve percent of 1,043 prisoners who were tested for drugs from the start of this year until June, tested positive for drugs.
SNT.56727.7576	Most of the drugs taken was marijuana while fourteen tested positive for "P".
SNT.56727.7577	In addition, a teenage prisoner, Liam Ashley, was recently strangled to death in a prison van by a much older adult prisoner.
SNT.56727.7578	Mr Power said that with all these new claims emerging, Mr O'Conner should resign as the minister of corrections.
SNT.80098.7579	Scotland defeated Romania 42-0 in Pool C of the 2007 Rugby World Cup at Murrayfield, Edinburgh.
SNT.80098.7580	Chris Paterson opened the scoring for Scotland in the second minute when he scored and converted a try.
SNT.80098.7581	Romania, who rarely looked like scoring, missed a chance to score a few minutes later when Ionut Dimofte missed a penalty.
SNT.80098.7582	Allister Hogg and Rory Lamont added a try each during the first half to extend Scotland's lead to 21-0 at the interval.
SNT.80098.7583	In the second half Scotland continued to dominate and Allister Hogg scored two more tries to complete his hat-trick.
SNT.80098.7584	Rory Lamont scored his second try towards the end of the match, and Scotland comfortably won without conceding a point.
SNT.80098.7585	Scotland have won both games played and are second in Pool C with ten points, behind New Zealand on points difference.
SNT.80098.7586	Romania have lost both their games and are fourth in the group with one point, behind Italy with four and Portugal with none.
SNT.126738.7587	A cyclone struck coastal areas of Bangladesh and India, causing flooding.
SNT.126738.7588	At least seventeen people have been killed as a result of the storm, and thousands have been left homeless.
SNT.126738.7589	Winds reaching 100 kilometres per hour in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal province, have uprooted trees and destroyed communication lines.
SNT.126738.7590	"The situation is very grave, countless families have been displaced, especially in the Sundarbans," said Kanti Ganguly, the state minister of the Sundarbans region of Western Bengal.
SNT.126738.7591	Airport operations in Kolkata were stopped as a result of the inclement weather; several Kolkata-bound flights were diverted elsewhere, and flights scheduled to depart were cancelled.
SNT.126738.7592	The India Meteorological Department has said that the cyclone will likely subside within 24 hours.
SNT.126738.7593	 “We expect the wind speed to peak in the next 24 hours."
SNT.126738.7594	"This isn’t an unusually strong cyclone and we don’t expect damage to be widespread,” said the department's director general, Ajith Tyagi.
SNT.19970.7595	On July 18, 2005 CN Rail notified the CAW that they intend to cancel the CN-CAW previously Negotiated Health & Safety Plan.
SNT.19970.7596	The CAW will be going to arbitration this fall to address the issue.
SNT.19970.7597	The CAW has asked that employees notify their Health and Safety Rep about any safety concerns at the work place.
SNT.19970.7598	CN Rail used to have part-time positions filled as well, but at this time there are no part-time employees to cover work if a full-time employee is absent.
SNT.19970.7599	Overtime is necessary to keep the trains running on time.
SNT.19970.7600	CN Rail expects the trains to go out on time, and in a safe condition, but staff is overworked, because there are not enough of them.
SNT.19970.7601	In fact, one worker noticed that most of the rail cars that contained 40 foot overseas containers did not have their loading guides in place.
SNT.19970.7602	Trains are not allowed to go out without these guides placed into the cars (the guides stop the loads from swaying from side to side in the cars), important for safety with double stacked containers, but it seems that in this case the lack of employees forced the train to leave without them.
SNT.55714.7603	New Zealand Members of Parliament will receive thousands more after getting pay increases today.
SNT.55714.7604	The pay rises for backbench MPs are between 3.8% and 4.1% which will mean a backbench MP will now earn around NZ$122,500.
SNT.55714.7605	The pay rises are to counter inflation next year of about 2.5% which will result in MPs receiving more money.
SNT.55714.7606	Other MPs with senior positions will get rises of between 4% and 8.1%.
SNT.55714.7607	This year the Prime Minister's increase will be worth just over $14,000 - paying her $6,942 a week.
SNT.55714.7608	Helen Clark, PM of New Zealand, received a 9.4 per cent rise last year, increasing her salary by nearly $30,000 to $347,000.
SNT.55714.7609	The latest increase will see her salary rise to about $361,000.
SNT.55714.7610	National's multimillionaire John Key has already secured a significant pay rise this week with his election to the leader's job and is on $216,000.
SNT.55714.7611	The pay rise will be backdated to July 1, The New Zealand Herald reported today.
SNT.55714.7612	Mr Key told The New Zealand Herald that he would donate a significant amount of his pay check to charitable organisations, as he has done since he first became an MP.
SNT.55714.7613	Last year backbenchers got a 4.1% increase in their pay.
SNT.55714.7614	Judges are also going to expect a pay rise next year of about 5%.
SNT.119156.7615	A trio of Canadian trekkers said Friday they completed the fastest unaided on-foot trek using the traditional route from Hercules Inlet on the Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole in a record time of 33 days, 23 hours and 30 minutes.
SNT.119156.7616	Ottawa ultra-runner Ray Zahab, age 39, adventure journalist and architect Kevin Vallely, age 44, of Lynn Valley, North Vancouver and North Pole expeditionist Richard Weber, age 49, said they completed the 700-mile (1,130-kilometer) journey, at 10,000 feet altitude, finally arriving early Wednesday morning.
SNT.119156.7617	They endured a white-out but survived on a 7,000-calorie-a-day diet of pemmican, Gatorade drink powder, outdated salami, deep-fried bacon, cheese and butter.
SNT.119156.7618	"If you took a cloud, wrapped it around your head and then duct-taped it, that's what a white-out is like," Mr Zahab, explained.
SNT.119156.7619	The trio also suffered altitude sickness, vertigo, massive, painful blisters, and temperatures as low as minus 40.
SNT.119156.7620	Zahab had to pull 170-lb (77-kg) sleds of equipment, traveling on foot and on snowshoes while the other two men skied.
SNT.119156.7621	According to ExplorersWeb.com's founder, Tom Sjogren, the trio erased the previous record of 39 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes, which was set by American Todd Carmichael, the first American to cross Antarctica to the South Pole alone, on foot and with no assistance.
SNT.119156.7622	Guinness World Records spokesman, Damian Field, in London, however, said that "Guinness monitors a category for fastest unsupported trek to the South Pole, but it has no record currently listed."
SNT.119156.7623	Prior to Carmichael, the record was held by Briton Hannah McKeand.
SNT.119156.7624	In the fastest journey to the South Pole (600 nautical mile journey), she completed solo and in just 39 days, 9 hours and 33 minutes.
SNT.119156.7625	In March 2008 she attempted to reach the North Pole alone and unsupported but had to abandon the trip after falling through the ice and badly damaging her shoulder.
SNT.119156.7626	Ray Zahab is a Canadian ultramarathon runner, personal trainer, and motivational speaker.
SNT.119156.7627	He lives in Chelsea, Quebec, and is famous for his 4,300-mile (6,920-kilometer) epic run across the Sahara Desert in 2007, which was the subject of a documentary narrated by actor Matt Damon's "Running the Sahara."
SNT.119156.7628	He heads Impossible2Possible, a nonprofit organization which advocates planet protection.
SNT.119156.7629	"I started looking at impossible places on the planet in the past year, and I said Antarctica is one of those impossible places, and if we can create an expedition, perhaps we can inspire a bunch of young people to realize they can achieve," Zahab said.
SNT.119156.7630	Richard Weber, M.S.M. (born June 9, 1959 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a world-renowned Canadian Arctic and polar adventurer, from Alcove (near Wakefield).
SNT.119156.7631	From 1978 to 2006, he participated in, lead and organized more than 45 Arctic expeditions.
SNT.119156.7632	Richard is the only person to have completed six full North Pole expeditions.
SNT.119156.7633	He has therefore trekked to the North Pole more than anyone in history.
SNT.119156.7634	The trio were waiting out a storm before boarding a flight to Chile for Ottawa.
SNT.119156.7635	"I'm pretty tired, actually," said Kevin Vallely, calling from Patriot Hills, Antarctica.
SNT.119156.7636	During the saga, Vallely was solely burdened with carrying the high-tech gear in his sled consisting of video cameras, satellite phones, hand-held computers, different kinds of solar panels, batteries and wires chargers.
SNT.119156.7637	"Had we not brought all that stuff we probably would have got it done faster because we wouldn't have had to carry all that weight, but then it doesn't matter as much," he explained.
SNT.119156.7638	Vallely said he also intends to produce a documentary of the expedition.
SNT.36068.7639	Shin Corporation, the multi-billion baht telecom and IT giant, has lost its defamation suit against Supinya Klangnarong for her comments in an interview with the Thai Post in July 2003.
SNT.36068.7640	In her interview Supinya, secretary general of the Campaign for Popular Media, had stated that Shin corporation gained revenue following the election of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the company's founder.
SNT.36068.7641	As a result the corporation sued her and five of the Thai Post's executives for defamation.
SNT.36068.7642	The court's finding that Supinya has a right to express her opinion, and that it did not defame Shin Corp. followed a number of attempts by the company to settle out of court or otherwise avoid a judgement.
SNT.36068.7643	This judgement comes at an inopportune moment for the Prime Minister: his family's recent tax-free sale of their stake in Shin has acted as a catalyst for the protests calling for Thaksin to resign.
SNT.19442.7644	The Australian government and the New South Wales State goverernment are going to fund the Forbes Global CEO Conference, to be held at the Sydney Opera House next week.
SNT.19442.7645	The State government has said that the contract prevents it from revealing how much taxpayers money will be spent.
SNT.19442.7646	A spokesman for the Deputy Premier, John Watkins, said that they could not divulge the costs "under the contract arrangements".
SNT.19442.7647	A government source suggested to the Sydney Morning Herald that the state and federal governments are spending up to $1million each.
SNT.19442.7648	The State government has been criticised for providing free police protection at the conference.
SNT.19442.7649	Security will require 200 police a day, at an estimated cost of more than $500,000.
SNT.19442.7650	According to the government, the large police presence is required because ASIO has assessed the event as "medium risk".
SNT.19442.7651	A number of Global justice and peace groups have pledged to protest at the conference.
SNT.19442.7652	The number of protestors is currerntly projected to be around 2,000.
SNT.15094.7653	Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced that 150 SAS personnel will be serving in Afghanistan within two months, and a further 200 troops will follow them by early next year.
SNT.15094.7654	According to Mr Howard the decision is the result of a request from the United States and others.
SNT.15094.7655	Opposition leader Kim Beazley has said that Labor supported the plan.
SNT.15094.7656	Mr Beazley has been critical of the government in recent weeks because of its military focus on Iraq rather than Afghanistan, which he says is the source of the terrorist threat.
SNT.15094.7657	Beazley offered that it has been "obvious for some time that the job was only partially completed when the commitment was made earlier."
SNT.15094.7658	The commitment comes amid a resurgence of the Taliban and an increase in insurgency activities in Afghanistan.
SNT.15094.7659	"The progress that has been made in the establishment of a legitimate government in Afghanistan has come under increasing attack and pressure from the Taliban - and some elements of al-Qaeda," Mr Howard said.
SNT.15094.7660	The additional troop commitment has been welcomed by the Afghani government.
SNT.15094.7661	Lutfullah Mashal, Afghanistan's Interior Ministry spokesman, said that assistance with security or reconstruction and development is always welcome, however he expressed disappointment that the deployment would only be for 12 months.
SNT.15094.7662	Mr Howard has said that he does not like to make open ended commitments, and also stated that extra security would be needed for the APEC summit in 2007.
SNT.15094.7663	"At the time of the APEC meeting and in the months leading up to it, the need in this country is for a heightened elite security capacity," he said.
SNT.79160.7664	ABC News has obtained and released a transcript of a taped message from Osama Bin Laden.
SNT.79160.7665	Osama bin Laden's first video in almost three years has surfaced but has mixed reviews in the Arab world.
SNT.79160.7666	Al Qaeda supporters are enthused by the video coinciding with the 6th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, but other parts of the Muslim world seemed worried that the video may spawn new attacks creating more instability in the region than there already is.
SNT.395375.7667	Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, announced his endorsement of Republican presidential candidate hopeful Mitt Romney yesterday.
SNT.395375.7668	This follows Romney's win in the Illinois primary on Tuesday, where he beat Rick Santorum by 12 percentage points.
SNT.395375.7669	In a statement, Bush argued that "now is the time for Republicans to unite behind Governor Romney and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job creation to all voters this fall".
SNT.395375.7670	He also stated that he believed Romney to be "a leader who understands the economy, recognises more government regulation is not the answer, believes in entrepreneurial capitalism and works to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed".
SNT.395375.7671	Romney welcomed the endorsement and stated that it was a "key moment" in his campaign for the presidential candidacy: "Jeb Bush is synonymous with good government and with conservative policies that yield results."
SNT.395375.7672	"He has long demonstrated an outstanding ability to bring people together."
SNT.395375.7673	"I therefore take tremendous pride in having earned his endorsement."
SNT.395375.7674	Fundraising figures have been released for February: Romney raised 12.5 million during the month, and spent $12.3 million on advertising.
SNT.395375.7675	The next primary will take place in Louisiana on Saturday, followed by primaries on April 3 in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia.
SNT.395375.7676	In Wisconsin, Romney is reported to be spending $2 million on television adverts compared to Santorum's $50,000.
SNT.122930.7677	New Jersey is considering a state-wide ban on Brazilian waxes, the removal of hair from the bikini area.
SNT.122930.7678	Although genital waxing has never really been allowed in the state, the New Jersey Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling plans to propose a ban with more specific legal wording, in response to two women who reported being injured during a wax.
SNT.122930.7679	The board will consider the proposal at their next meeting on April 14.
SNT.122930.7680	If the measure passes, New Jersey may become the only US state to ban the practice outright.
SNT.122930.7681	Although millions of Americans engage in bikini waxes, which generally cost between $50 and $60 per session, the practice comes with risks.
SNT.122930.7682	Skin care experts say the hot wax can irritate delicate skin in the bikini area, and result in infections, ingrown hairs and rashes.
SNT.122930.7683	Waxing on the face, neck, abdomen, legs and arms would continue to be permitted in the state under the proposed ban.
SNT.122930.7684	Although New Jersey statutes have always banned bikini waxing, the laws were unclear and seldom enforced.
SNT.122930.7685	As a result, many salons from around the state have offered bikini waxing for years.
SNT.122930.7686	Many salon owners spoke out against the proposed ban, which they said would severely damage their business.
SNT.122930.7687	"I really don't know if the state can stop it at this point," said Valentia Chistova, owner of the Monmouth County salon Brazil.
SNT.122930.7688	"I know a lot of women who are really hooked."
SNT.30733.7689	The Israeli ministry of tourism is reconsidering cutting ties with Christian televangelist Pat Robertson over the construction of a Christian heritage, pilgrimage and tourism site near the Sea of Galilee.
SNT.30733.7690	The Christian Heritage Center which would stretch over 125 acres is placed where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus taught and lived in the Galilee region.
SNT.30733.7691	Robertson was one of the people at the heart of the project which was supported by many other evangelicals who worked to raise $50 million (USD).
SNT.30733.7692	Israeli tourism minister, Avraham Hirchson, and Robertson were just about to sign an agreement that the Israeli government would set aside land and infrastructure for the site, when Robertson made comments on his daily show, The 700 Club, claiming that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was "Divine retribution" for withdrawing from the Gaza Strip.
SNT.30733.7693	Robertson said, "'This is my land,' and for any prime minister of Israel who decides he is going to carve it up and give it away, God says, 'No, this is mine.'"
SNT.30733.7694	Many evangelicals considered the withdrawal as retreating from biblical prophecy of Jewish sovereignty over the Holy Land.
SNT.30733.7695	Robertson's comments earned him a harsh backlash from many different groups, including the White House and former Presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
SNT.30733.7696	A spokesperson for Robertson said the comments were taken out of context.
SNT.30733.7697	On Wednesday, Robertson sent a letter addressed to Sharon's son Omri apologizing for his comments.
SNT.30733.7698	In the letter, Robertson said Sharon is "kind, gracious, and gentle man" who was "carrying an almost insurmountable burden of making decisions for his nation."
SNT.30733.7699	The letter further added, "My concern for the future safety of your nation led me to make remarks which I can now view in retrospect as inappropriate and insensitive in light of a national grief."
SNT.30733.7700	Robertson wrote, "I ask your forgiveness and the forgiveness of the people of Israel."
SNT.30733.7701	According to the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Israel accepts the apology.
SNT.30733.7702	However, despite the apology by Robertson, it was doubtful that he would be brought back into the plan.
SNT.30733.7703	Hirchson said on Wednesday that "Robertson's help was no longer welcome."
SNT.30733.7704	Ironically, Robertson helped make television ministries what they are today, and the Heritiage Center would contain studios and satellite uplinks for live broadcasts.
SNT.30733.7705	The groundbreaking for the project is slated to begin later in the year.
SNT.34734.7706	A leaked draft of a report on instances of state repression during Mexico's "dirty war" has been called into question by top officials.
SNT.34734.7707	Report author, Ignacio Carrillo, assigned to the task by President Fox, commented by saying, "He will have to render his report."
SNT.34734.7708	"It will be placed in an open, public place," and "that will be there for history, but legally it's over."
SNT.34734.7709	This being a reference to the fact that the Supreme Court has ruled that it is too late to prosecute possible offenders.
SNT.34734.7710	Carrillo claims, however, that his report is similar to the recently leaked draft.
SNT.34734.7711	He said, "It's not going to totally contradict the draft."
SNT.34734.7712	The draft was published by a Mexican magazine, claiming that the public has a right to know.
SNT.34734.7713	The basis for the report is recently declassified military documents from the years 1964 – 1982.
SNT.34734.7714	Carrillo also claims that his work was hindered by resistance from the courts, bad resources, and people involved being unwilling to cooperate.
SNT.34734.7715	The Dirty War refers to the use of state terrorism in Latin America in a period from the 1960s to the 1980s, usually targeted at groups opposed to the government (usually leftist groups).
SNT.34734.7716	Much controversy exists in the region about what is to be done with alleged offenders in the Dirty War.
SNT.110057.7717	Thai low-cost air carrier One-Two-Go Airlines has announced that it will be grounding all 16 of its aircraft immediately until September 15.
SNT.110057.7718	The news comes as legal action against the airline and associated companies begins over the September crash of Flight 269, which killed 90 people, mostly foreigners.
SNT.110057.7719	Udom Tantiprasongchai, founder of the airline, has said conditions were hard for airlines with fuel prices having doubled within a year.
SNT.110057.7720	He says 70% of operating costs are taken up with fuel, and the airline has already raised fuel surcharges again by 100 baht to 850 baht per leg.
SNT.110057.7721	"In this kind of environment, anyone can go (bankrupt) anytime," said Urdom, who declined to comment on the impact the present financial situation has had on his airline, saying only that they "are financially sustainable."
SNT.110057.7722	He also said that the airline could return to service with ease if prices dropped, noting that, "if the situation improved with fuel prices being lowered and the profitability outlook was better, we could be airborne again."
SNT.110057.7723	The airline began operations in 2003; it is a subsidiary of Orient Thai Airlines.
SNT.110057.7724	Orient Thai, which will continue to operate as normal, recently opened Thailand's first freight-only airline, Orient Thai Cargo, with a pair of Boeing 747-200Fs bought from Japan Airlines.
SNT.110057.7725	Urdon said that a major part of the problem is that eight of the company's aircraft are MD-11s, which consume large volumes of fuel.
SNT.110057.7726	He also said that a collapse of a damage limitation scheme with rivals Nok Airlines and Thai AirAsia had affected his decision.
SNT.110057.7727	The news comes as the first families of victims of Flight OG269 launch legal action against the airline, as well as parent airline Orient Thai and lessor Grandmax Group.
SNT.110057.7728	Already confirmed to be involved in the action are Richard and Margaret Collins as well as Steve and Jean Jones, parents of Alex Collins, 22, and Bethan Jones, also 22, an unmarried Welsh couple who, a few days into a round-the-world trip, were among the 123 passengers on board.
SNT.110057.7729	Alex was reported missing but quickly confirmed to have died, while Bethan died ten days after the accident with her family at her bedside, bringing the final death toll to 90.
SNT.110057.7730	"We believe the air crash was completely avoidable and those responsible should be held to account."
SNT.110057.7731	"While we accept that nothing can bring Alex and Bethan and the other people who lost their lives back, we are keen to make sure we prevent this from happening again," said the families in a joint statement.
SNT.110057.7732	"We will be forcing One-Two-Go Airlines to prove in court that they are not a low cost, low safety airline," said James Healy-Pratt, head of aviation at Stewarts Law in London.
SNT.110057.7733	He also said that the action will be brought before courts in the United States.
SNT.71800.7734	Finnish symphonic power metal band, Nightwish, has announced details about their latest studio album, which will be the first to feature new Swedish lead vocalist Anette Olzon, who recently replaced Tarja Turunen.
SNT.71800.7735	Among the details released is the name of the new album, which until now had been unrevealed.
SNT.71800.7736	Nightwish have also released a full track listing for the album and revealed that as well as Eva, which has already been released, the song Amaranth will be released as a single.
SNT.71800.7737	The album will debut in the band's native Finland on September 26 from record labels Spinefarm Records and distributed by Universal Music Group.
SNT.71800.7738	It will be released in the US and the rest of Europe two days later, with the US label being Roadrunner Records and the European label being Nuclear Blast Records.
SNT.71800.7739	Nuclear Blast will release Amaranth on August 24 and Spinefarm/Universal will release it on August 22.
SNT.75987.7740	According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) at least two earthquakes with a magnitude 7.2 and 5.1 have rocked the island of Vanuatu.
SNT.75987.7741	The first 7.2 quake was recorded at 4:08 a.m., Thursday morning local time (UTC+11), 55 kilometers (35 miles) east, southeast of Luganville, Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu with a depth of 144.8 km (90.0 miles).
SNT.75987.7742	The second 5.1 quake was recorded at 47 km (29 miles) east, northeast of Santo (Luganville), Vanuatu with a depth of 149.3 km (92.8 miles) and it struck nearly one hour later at 5:07 a.m.
SNT.75987.7743	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a tsunami bulletin for the first quake saying that "based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami not expected," but that small waves could be expected locally near the quake's epicenter.
SNT.75987.7744	So far there are no reports of injuries, deaths or damage, but the USGS reports that damage could be "moderate to heavy."
SNT.75987.7745	"No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time; however, this earthquake may have caused damage due to its location and size," said a statement by the USGS on its website.
SNT.52388.7746	Dove soaps continues their North American "Campaign for Real Beauty" advertising with a television commercial that explores the alterations that can be done on models.
SNT.52388.7747	From there, she is primped and plucked by hair and makeup artists, then tweaked on a Photoshop-like program.
SNT.52388.7748	The photo-manipulation is then posted on a billboard for the fictional "Easel Foundation Makeup" brand.
SNT.52388.7749	Two young, teenage girls walk past, glancing at the board.
SNT.52388.7750	"No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted" ends the ad in text, "Every girl deserves to feel beautiful just the way she is."
SNT.52388.7751	Dove runs the Dove Self-Esteem Fund as a part of their Campaign for Real Beauty.
SNT.52388.7752	In the marketing campaign, Dove uses "real" women, instead of professional models, in an attempt to instill self-esteem in their customers.
SNT.52388.7753	This continuing promotion, launched in 2004, was on the forefront of a current trend in Western culture to abandon the overly idealised images the media portrays of women.
SNT.52388.7754	Recently some fashion capitals have mandated minimum body mass indexes for runway models.
SNT.52388.7755	The top rated comedy in the United States and Canada is Ugly Betty, a series that stars an average girl coping at a fashion magazine.
SNT.52388.7756	The series is based on Betty la Fea, an extremely popular Colombian telenovela, which has been reproduced internationally.
SNT.52388.7757	Only two percent of women surveyed worldwide consider themselves beautiful, according to ABC Good Morning America co-anchor Robin Roberts, whose program debuted the commercial this morning at 8:07 am EST.
SNT.52388.7758	The ad is currently playing on the Campaign for Real Beauty's homepage.
SNT.8453.7759	Australian officials have impounded 27 Indonesian boats and 240 crew off the country's north coast, in what it says is the biggest operation against illegal fishing so far.
SNT.8453.7760	Fisheries Minister, Ian Macdonald, told the nation's ABC Radio that a number of boats caught fishing for shark fin and reef fish had been taken to Gove and Darwin.
SNT.8453.7761	The nine-day joint navy, customs and army "Operation Clearwater" was continuing, and had taken months to plan.
SNT.8453.7762	"I think all of the illegal vessels up there, because of their inter-vessel communication will now be aware that there is a major sting on by the Australian authorities and those that haven't been arrested, I think will be hightailing it back to Indonesian ports as we speak," said Senator MacDonald.
SNT.8453.7763	Intelligence indicated what he called "organised transnational criminal activity", including some Asian connections beyond the Indonesian village ports where the vessels originated, but the activity was apparently limited to illegal fishing, and did not include smuggling.
SNT.8453.7764	"We are talking about large-scale commercial operations rather than simply subsistence fishing," Macdonald said in a statement, indicating that fifteen of the boats were large vessels with ice for storage.
SNT.8453.7765	Two boats each had one tonne of fish, and shark fin.
SNT.8453.7766	Fishing by some Indonesian peoples has occurred legitimately in the area between the two nations for hundreds of years before European colonization.
SNT.8453.7767	A 1906 Australian claim on as much as 80% of the waters has since been softened by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two governments, recognizing some traditional fishing rights.
SNT.8453.7768	However analysts say the Australian government strategy is flawed, since it is based on the fishing technology employed, rather than catch numbers.
SNT.8453.7769	At time of writing, it has not been ascertained whether the currently detained vessels were fishing in such "traditional" waters or not, or whether they were operated by crews who would have traditional fishing rights, if they had been in compliance with the MOU.
SNT.8453.7770	Senator MacDonald told the ABC Radio programme AM that he expected in the case of those thought to have been fishing in Australian waters illegally, the captain and perhaps the senior fishing master would be charged, with other crew being immediately repatriated to Indonesia.
SNT.8453.7771	As for the boats, "We're required by international law to offer them to bond them back to the owners, but as the crew are immediately repatriated the ability of the owners to get them back to Indonesia ... is fairly limited," the Senator explained.
SNT.8453.7772	"I would expect that most of these boats apprehended in operation Clearwater will actually be forfeited to the crown and will be destroyed."
SNT.8453.7773	The fishermen were expected to appear in court next week, reported Reuters news agency.
SNT.8453.7774	An Indonesian fisherman was last week fined $A130,000, setting a new record, after his boat was caught off with over 100kg of dried reef fish, 300kg of fish on ice and 10kg of dried shark fin.
SNT.8453.7775	The Northern Territory Fisheries Minister, Kon Vatskalis, on ABC Radio asked the Federal Government to commit the same level of resources permanently.
SNT.8453.7776	"Provide the extra funding, provide the extra resources to the Navy and the Customs and then they will be able to stop the illegal boats, not only when they run an operation but every day, every week, every month," Mr Vatskalis told the ABC.
SNT.199009.7777	An earthquake of magnitude 7.0 on the Richter scale has been reported as having struck the Pacific island of New Britain, the second island in the Papua and New Guinea group.
SNT.199009.7778	The quake, which struck at 22:01 UTC yesterday evening, hit at a depth of approximately 54 kilometers (34 mi) according to the United States Geological Survey.
SNT.199009.7779	According to a member of staff at the Port Moresby Geophysical Observatory, minor effects of the quake were felt there, more than South West of the epicenter.
SNT.199009.7780	First reports from the area indicate that the Western parts of New Britain have no power or telecommunications.
SNT.199009.7781	A report posted in the local language, Tok Pisin by Radio Australia's language service, gives the general location of the quake as Southeast of Madang, and there are no initial reports of any tsunami warnings, and no reports of damage or casualties at press time.

SNT.10355.7802	The World Health Organization (WHO) announced Wednesday that an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever, caused by Marburg virus, in Angola has claimed the lives of 311 Angolans.
SNT.10355.7803	The great majority of cases have originated in Uige Province.
SNT.10355.7804	WHO estimates that 75% of the cases have occurred in children under the age of 5 years old.
SNT.10355.7805	From the WHO: :'Marburg virus disease has no vaccine or curative treatment, and can be rapidly fatal.'
SNT.10355.7806	In the present outbreak, most deaths have occurred between 3 to 7 days following the onset of symptoms.'
SNT.10355.7807	Past outbreaks indicate that close contact with bodily fluids of infected people, as may occur in health care settings or during burial practices, increases the risk of infection.'
SNT.10355.7808	This is the largest recorded outbreak of Marburg viral hemorrhagic fever in history.
SNT.10355.7809	The risk to international travelers is low, according to the WHO, because the disease requires close personal contact to be transmitted.
SNT.502180.7810	San Fernando, Chile — Ten students from the Liceo María Luisa Bombal of Rancagua, O'Higgins Region were detained by the local police yesterday.
SNT.502180.7811	Following their release, the students told the media they were required to remove their clothes at the police station.
SNT.502180.7812	The students, seven men and three women, took control of the building of the school early yesterday morning in response to the long delay in re-construction of the liceo, following the earthquake of 2010.
SNT.502180.7813	At around 08:00 local time (1200 UTC), Leonardo Fuentes, general secretary of the Municipal Educational Corporation of Rancagua, authorized the police to clear out the students.
SNT.502180.7814	Student leader Jennifer Olivares told Diario VI Región the police "stripped off [their] clothes" upon their arrival at the police station, Comisaría de Rancagua, something which Lieutenant Colonel of Carabineros Iván Guajardo did not deny.
SNT.502180.7815	However, police stated the students will be charged by the public prosecutor with robbing food from the school.
SNT.502180.7816	Ignacio Muñoz, former leader of the occupation of the Liceo María Luisa Bombal, told El Rancahuaso "the Mayor [Eduardo Soto] promised to begin the reconstruction works last summer, and it's August already and they don't even begin to take the debris outside".

SNT.28532.7832	Exactly one year since the popular Suprnova BitTorrent link site went offline, its founder, Andrej Preston (known as "Sloncek" to the Internet community), has spoken out about what happened on his website.
SNT.28532.7833	After twelve months of speculation amongst former users and many sites popping up to try and take its place, Preston says "it is time for everybody to know the truth and that it is time for me to stop pretending like nothing ever happened".
SNT.28532.7834	According to Preston his nightmare began in November, 2004 when he received a phonecall from his ISP stating that Preston's servers had just been raided.
SNT.28532.7835	Preston claims that at this time he had no communication from the police.
SNT.28532.7836	After reading about himself in various Slovenian newspapers in early December, Preston decided to take his suprnova.org site offline.
SNT.28532.7837	At the same time another project Preston was involved in eXeem was touted as being the biggest thing to happen to file sharing.
SNT.28532.7838	Preston claims that a month or so after his site went offline his home was raided by the police at 6:30 in the morning.
SNT.28532.7839	Preston was then called into the local police unit another month later for a hearing.
SNT.28532.7840	Preston, on the advice of his lawyer decided he would not answer anything during the interview with the police.
SNT.28532.7841	At the conclusion of the interview Preston was told that the matter would be handed over to the prosecutor.
SNT.28532.7842	Preston recalls that on October 18, 2005 he received a notice to go to the post office and pick up another letter which he must sign for.
SNT.28532.7843	Upon receiving the notice Preston says that he "became completely depressed and sad".
SNT.28532.7844	Preston however was greeted with good news at the post office when he opened the letter and discovered that his matter had been dropped.
SNT.60135.7845	Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh and Damascus-based chief Khaled Meshaal ofHamas arrived in Mecca, Saudi Arabia for negotiations in an attempt to end the fighting between Hamas and Fatah in the Gaza strip.
SNT.60135.7846	Ever since the Hamas movement, which refuses to recognize Israel and stop attacks on Israel, won elections for the Palestinian parliament last year, there have been repeated clashes between the two groups.
SNT.60135.7846-1	The result has been over 80 deaths.
SNT.60135.7847	Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah called the talks in order to stop the violence and help both sides to come to an agreement and establish some sort of unity government.
SNT.60135.7848	Hamas and Fatah officials said they hoped the leaders would come together for a meeting with King Abdullah later on Tuesday night.
SNT.60135.7849	The leaders are expected to take a pilgrimage to the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam's holiest site, before opening talks, which are expected to continue on Wednesday.
SNT.60135.7850	The United States and the European Union have labelled Hamas a terrorist organization and have blocked financial aid until the movement recognizes Israel and agrees to uphold previous agreements with Israel signed by the Palestinian Authority.
SNT.60135.7851	Senior Abbas aide, Azzam al-Ahmad, said the talks would aim to persuade Hamas to accept the program of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which would involve an implicit Hamas recognition of Israel that could end the aid blockade.
SNT.60135.7852	If indeed such a government can be formed it will allow the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians that were stopped in 2003.
SNT.60135.7853	Previous attempts to negotiate an agreement between the two Palestinian groups have ended in cease- fire that have lasted only a short time.
SNT.63069.7854	Rick DiPietro stopped 35 of 36 shots as the New York Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-1 Thursday night, snapping a three game losing streak and DiPietro's career high 31st win of the season.
SNT.63069.7855	It was a frustrating game for the Penguins, as they were unable to convert 0 of 6 power play attempts.
SNT.63069.7856	Colby Armstrong scored the game's first goal, assisted by Gary Roberts and Sergei Gonchar, to give the Penguins the early lead.

SNT.63035.7862	SpaceX Corporation launched its Falcon I rocket today from Kwajalein Atoll.
SNT.63035.7863	Liftoff occurred at 6:00 PM PDT, following two previous launch aborts this week.
SNT.63035.7864	The first stage was completely successful, although there appeared to be some problems with the second stage.
SNT.63035.7865	The sub-orbital flight reached an altitude of 300 km, and is on a traectory for re-entry.
SNT.63035.7866	It was intended to go into orbit, but contact was lost before this could be accomplished
SNT.63035.7867	This is the second launch for the low-cost SpaceX rocket, and the first successful launch for the company.
SNT.63035.7868	The previous launch had a successful lift-off, but failed 35 seconds into the flight and crashed near to the launch pad due to a fuel leak in the engine.
SNT.62412.7869	Scientists at NASA say that new satellite images of Saturn's moon Enceladus taken in 2005, has shown that the moon has begun to spew geysers which contain liquid water, and that the internal heat produced by the moon's core may be able to host life below the icy surface, but scientists also stress that life has not yet been found on the moon.
SNT.62412.7870	Scientists say that the heat source producing the geysers is "organic" and that the material used to spew them is caused by the decaying of radioactive material from inside the moon.
SNT.62412.7871	"Deep inside Enceladus, our model indicates we've got an organic brew, a heat source and liquid water, all key ingredients for life."
SNT.62412.7872	"And while no one is claiming that we have found life by any means, we probably have evidence for a place that might be hospitable to life," said Dennis Matson, a scientist for the Cassini project.
SNT.62412.7873	In a new model created by NASA scientists, data shows that Enceladus might have been created by aluminum and iron isotopes which have begun to decay causing large amounts of heat to build up in the moon and over billions of years later, the icy mass has began to melt near the moon's core, causing the water to spew into outer space.
SNT.62412.7874	"Enceladus is a very small body, and it's made almost entirely of ice and rock."
SNT.62412.7875	"The puzzle is how the moon developed a warm core."
SNT.62412.7876	"The only way to achieve such high temperatures at Enceladus is through the very rapid decay of some radioactive species," said Dr. Julie Castillo, the lead scientist developing the new model at the Jet Propulsion laboratory or JPL.
SNT.62412.7877	"The decomposition of those isotopes - over a period of about 7 million years - would produce enormous amounts of heat."
SNT.62412.7878	"This would result in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice."
SNT.62412.7879	"According to the theory, the remaining, more slowly decaying radioactivity in the core could continue to warm and melt the moon's interior for billions of years, along with tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug," said a statement on NASA"s website.
SNT.62412.7880	Data from Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer further shows that the natural building blocks of life are also present within Enceladus.
SNT.62412.7881	The results show that carbon dioxide, acetylene, methane, propane and nitrogen, the basic building blocks for life, are all present within the moon.
SNT.62412.7882	"The team concludes that so far, all the findings and the hot start model indicate that a warm, organic-rich mixture was produced below the surface of Enceladus and might still be present today, making the moon a promising kitchen for the cooking of primordial soup," added the statement.
SNT.62412.7883	Cassini will make a flyby on Enceladus in march of 2008.
SNT.62412.7884	The mission will "measure the gas emanating from the plume," ended the statement.
SNT.27149.7885	In what appeared to be a hostage situation ended in tragedy this afternoon in the quiet Massachusetts town of North Reading when the body of a 72-year old man, Roaldas Baran, and his 65-year old wife, Zinaida Girdauskiene, were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide at 14 Country Club Road.

SNT.27149.7887	Police arrived at the home, and encountered the 72-year old man standing over, a brief conversation was held with the man who then went back inside the house.
SNT.27149.7888	The SWAT team of the North Eastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council was brought in to clear the house and evacuate the surrounding houses.
SNT.27149.7889	Martha Coakley, the District Attorney for Middlesex County reported on what was found upon the SWAT team entering the house.
SNT.27149.7890	"In the bedroom, lying, apparently a victim of several gunshot wounds, was a female."
SNT.27149.7891	"In the kitchen on the floor, also apparently the victim of a suicide, was a male we know now to be approximately 72-years-old who was her husband."
SNT.27149.7892	Emily LaGrassa, Coxley's spokeperson said the man apparently shot the woman and turned the gun on himself.
SNT.27149.7893	North Reading Police had been called to the house once before in August 2004.
SNT.60427.7894	At some time before 11 AM, local time, a fire started in Bar Apache on the popular Phi Phi Island in Thailand.
SNT.60427.7895	By eleven it had spread to neighbouring shops and restaurants along the main road.
SNT.60427.7896	Since there is no fire brigade on Phi Phi, locals and tourists formed a bucket chain to help put out the fire.
SNT.60427.7897	An eye witness, Simon Vestling, says there were over 300 people helping out with putting out the fire and tearing down buildings.
SNT.60427.7898	To stop the fire from spreading to other nearby buildings, which are closely grouped together, they were forced to pull some of them down using nothing but man power.
SNT.60427.7899	This managed to stop the fire from spreading to the rest of the island, but 10 buildings were still burnt down, mostly small shops and bars.
SNT.60427.7900	Boats were brought over from local Krabi Island in case an evacuation was needed, but that was not the case.
SNT.60427.7901	The cost of the damage is estimated to be Bt2million.
SNT.60427.7902	Two Swedes sustained minor injuries from the smoke, but were treated with oxygen at a nearby dive center.
SNT.30955.7903	The debate over whether Australians should be required to have a national identity card has been reignited following an announcement by Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock yesterday that a study will be conducted.
SNT.30955.7904	The concept is not new, being first floated by Bob Hawke in 1986.
SNT.30955.7905	The idea was abandoned after being defeated in the Australian Senate and due to strong criticism.
SNT.30955.7906	The government cites terrorism and fraud protection as needs for a universal national identity system.
SNT.30955.7907	The opposition remains neutral on the proposal, saying only that cost and privacy would be major issues.
SNT.30955.7908	Defence Minister Robert Hill is cautious of such a plan, saying "I don't believe governments are entitled to any more information about you than is absolutely necessary".
SNT.30955.7909	The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which represents big business in Australia has voiced its opposition to the plan claiming the system could cost $750 per person to introduce, most of which would be borne by big business.
SNT.128117.7910	Wikinews has learned that the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) website has been hacked and is suffering from an apparent Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS).
SNT.128117.7911	As of this report, the main IRIB website could be reached.
SNT.128117.7912	Just after 6:00 p.m. (EDT) the site came back online with only a few connection issues.
SNT.128117.7913	On further investigation, it was discovered that an individual or group claims responsibility for attacking the website on an Iranian internet forum.
SNT.128117.7914	As part of the attack, at least one section of the IRIB website, an apparent user space, was replaced with what appears to be videos and images of protests within Iran.
SNT.128117.7915	The page also contains the statement "hacked by the Iranian people."
SNT.128117.7916	It was also discovered that citizens have set up internet channels on IRC in an attempt to disseminate proxy servers and addresses to bypass the blocking of the internet by the Iranian government.
SNT.128117.7917	The Iranian government has blocked access to the Internet, or access to websites, in nearly all of Iran.
SNT.128117.7918	A partial list of blocked websites includes Facebook, BBC, and several Iranian based websites.
SNT.254377.7919	"We launched an operation to neutralise heavy weapons Gbagbo's special forces have been using against the civilian population for the last three months."
SNT.254377.7920	"We destroyed them in four locations", said spokesman Hamadoun Toure in an email.
SNT.254377.7921	In concert with the UN, France has deployed an additional 350 peacekeepers to compliment its 7,500 troops already in the country.
SNT.254377.7922	It was also reported that the French were in control of the airport in Abidjan.
SNT.254377.7923	The recent violence in Ivory Coast stems from Gbagbo's refusal to accept his loss in the recent presidential elections.
SNT.254377.7924	He has stated that he will not transfer power to his successor Alassane Ouattara, the declared winner.
SNT.254377.7925	Gbagbo's spokesman, Abdon George Bayeto, told the BBC the elections were rigged as an "international plot against the incumbent" and was going to continue fighting forces loyal to Ouattara.
SNT.254377.7926	Lieutenant Jean-Marc Tago of the Ivory Coast army announced the return of General Phillippe Mangou.
SNT.254377.7927	Although it has been reported that the general's family was being held hostage by Gbagbo forces, Tago claims this is untrue, saying, "The general is with us, and has always been with us."
SNT.254377.7928	"Our plan is to defend the institutions of the republic against all its enemies, against the rebels, against the mercenaries, against the [United Nations] and all those who are attacking the institutions of the republic commanded by President Laurent Gbagbo."
SNT.254377.7929	British foreign secretary William Hague said in a statement, "We call for an end to the violence, for defeated former president Gbagbo to step down, for all human rights abuses to be investigated, and for the International Criminal Court to investigate the crimes which appear to have taken place."
SNT.254377.7930	The crisis has created a humanitarian problem as one million of Abidjan's four million people has been displaced.
SNT.260312.7931	State officials in Queensland, Australia, have begun working on a draft protocol to use security cameras to record conversations in taxis.
SNT.260312.7932	The new draft proposes to change a current policy which allows for cameras in taxis which do not record sound for privacy reasons, in the hope that audio recordings will make some investigations easier.
SNT.260312.7933	The paper, which says audio recordings would "provide greater certainty with regard to investigations, particularly in situation of conflicting statements," is currently at the Transport and Main Roads department.
SNT.260312.7934	The proposal also suggests extending the time taxi companies can keep recordings downloaded from security cameras from the current 30–35 days.
SNT.260312.7935	The chairman of one taxi company said the proposed measure would increase the safety of his drivers.
SNT.260312.7936	"In 2006 the government introduced the security cameras and most cabs now have GPS units," he said.
SNT.260312.7937	"What we've got now is an improvement over having nothing at all and as a result there has been a fair improvement in the reduction of assaults on taxi drivers."
SNT.260312.7938	Queensland Taxi Advisers Incorporated, a union of taxi operators, said they supported the introduction of audio recording because it would create "greater transparency and certainty in investigations where there were conflicting statements from drivers and passengers."
SNT.260312.7939	To address privacy concerns, the paper proposes to add stickers to the entry points at the taxis.
SNT.260312.7940	Scott Emerson, a spokesperson for the Liberal National Party of Queensland, objected to the measure on privacy grounds.
SNT.260312.7941	"We need to know how these recordings are going to be used," he said.
SNT.260312.7942	Michael Cope, the president of the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties said he opposed the measure because the recordings might be used by taxi companies in civil cases concerning driver complaints.
SNT.260312.7943	"We're swapping from saying it's about safety to saying it's about setting fare disputes," he said.
SNT.260312.7944	"We don't think that justifies collecting ... intensely personal information that audio recordings collect."
SNT.260312.7945	Queensland's privacy commissioner Linda Matthews reacted said the recordings would be used for genuine law enforcement purposes.
SNT.260312.7946	Annastacia Palaszczuk, Queensland's Transport Minister, said the ideas within the proposal would be heavily considered before being implemented.
SNT.260312.7947	She said: "If people think it's a good idea then we go to full consultation."
SNT.260312.7948	"I would be meeting with the privacy commissioner, I'd be meeting with the taxi industry, I'd be consulting with members of the public in a much more formal way."
SNT.123643.7949	Mount Redoubt, a volcano in Alaska, erupted on Saturday, sending out clouds of ash thousands of feet high.
SNT.123643.7950	According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport was shut down after ash reached the airport.
SNT.123643.7951	Jeremy Lindseth, a spokesman for the airport, said that only small amount of ash reached the airport, but was significant enough to disrupt operations, as ash can cause engine problems for aircraft.
SNT.123643.7952	He said that he was uncertain of how many flights were affected due to the eruption.
SNT.123643.7953	The eruption happened at around 1:30 PM local time, the United States Geological Survey reported.
SNT.123643.7954	The volcano had erupted four times on Friday, billowing ash up to 51,000 feet up into the air.
SNT.123643.7955	These are the latest in a series of eruptions from Mount Redoubt, which started on March 22.
SNT.123643.7956	The volcano had not erupted since a four-month period in 1989-90.
SNT.123643.7957	The Alaska Volcano Observatory set its alert level at red, the highest possible level, meaning that an eruption is imminent, and that it would send a "significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere."
SNT.9292.7958	The animated series Family Guy returned to the FOX television network with a new episode Sunday for the first time since it was taken off the schedule three years ago.
SNT.9292.7959	Although the show kept most of its audience that lead-in The Simpsons gave, FOX was still fourth out of five major broadcast networks in the half-hour, losing most notably to ABC's hit Desperate Housewives (UPN, the other major American broadcast network, does not air original programming on Sundays).
SNT.9292.7960	However, the season premiere of Family Guy and the series debut of American Dad (which helped usher in what the network termed "The New FOX Sunday") helped bring FOX to the #2 spot out of five networks in the crucial 18 to 49 demographic, one of the most important to advertisers in the key May sweeps period.
SNT.9292.7961	"Sweeps" occurs four times a year and helps networks and independent affiliates determine how much a fixed amount of time for commercial advertisement will cost (the higher the ratings, the more revenue for the networks selling the time to advertisers).
SNT.9292.7962	On the whole, Family Guy averaged a 6.3 rating in the overnights as posted by Zap2It.
SNT.9292.7963	While the overnight ratings are fairly accurate, the numbers are preliminary and are subject to minor change.
SNT.9292.7964	One ratings point is equal to 1,096,000 households, as there are now 109,600,000 households in the United States with at least one television.
SNT.9292.7965	This translates into a little more than 6.9 million households whose sets were tuned into Family Guy, as recorded by the sample of "Nielsen families," who record their viewing habits and contribute to the ratings process the US uses.
SNT.9292.7966	The use of the word "share" in the article means that it is the rough percentage of viewers with their sets on at that hour tuning into a certain program.
SNT.9292.7967	For example, nine percent of viewers in the United States with their televisions on at 9 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time were tuned to Family Guy.
SNT.9292.7968	This only added up to a 9 household share for the hour, compared to an 11 share for Law & Order: Criminal Intent on NBC, a 14 share for a CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame movie of the week (traditionally only aired during the key sweeps periods), and a 23 share for the aforementioned Desperate Housewives.
SNT.9292.7969	Averaged with the performance of American Dad, a cartoon produced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, FOX earned a mere 5.8 rating/9 share for the hour.
SNT.9292.7970	The episode revolved around a big scheme Peter Griffin, the main character of the series, conjured.
SNT.9292.7971	To give his wife Lois (who no longer finds him sexually attractive) a second honeymoon in order to "spice up" their love life, he pretends to be actor Mel Gibson so they can stay in a new luxury hotel for free.
SNT.9292.7972	Peter stumbles upon a sequel to the film The Passion of the Christ, and vows to keep the movie from ever seeing the light of day.
SNT.9292.7973	To get the movie back, Gibson kidnaps Lois and keeps her captive on top of Mount Rushmore, which leads to a scene in which the three battle on top of the monument, in a homage to the film North by Northwest.
SNT.22561.7974	The London bomb suspect, Hussain Osman, also known as Hamdi Issac, has arrived in London and been arrested following his extradition from Italy.
SNT.22561.7975	Allegedly involved in the second set of attacks on London in July, which targeted the city's public transport infrastructure, Osman was arrested in Rome by Italian police on July 29, just one week after the failed attacks.
SNT.22561.7976	On September 13, a final appeal against extradition was rejected by an Italian court despite his lawyer's protests that he could not get a fair trial in the UK.
SNT.22561.7977	Osman is accused of planting the failed bomb at Shepherd's Bush Underground station.
SNT.22561.7978	His flight subsequent to the attack proved futile as phone records led police to Rome, and a raid on his brother's apartment, where he was captured.
SNT.22561.7979	Pending his extradition, he was held at Rebibbia jail, Rome, a high-security facility on the outskirts of the city.
SNT.22561.7980	He left the jail late on Thursday and the Ethiopian-born terror suspect flew out of Italy at 12pm local time, accompanied by officers from the Metropolitan police.
SNT.22561.7981	Flying on a chartered private jet, Osman and his escort landed at RAF Northolt, where Osman was charged on arrival.
SNT.22561.7982	He is expected to be put on trial at the Old Bailey in London, alongside the other suspects involved in the failed attacks.
SNT.145685.7983	The corpse of former Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has been stolen by grave robbers.
SNT.145685.7984	Officials report that his body was taken overnight from the Deftera Cemetery in Nicosia.
SNT.145685.7985	The theft was reported one day before the anniversary of his death.
SNT.145685.7986	Police reported that fresh mounds of dirt were piled up beside the grave.
SNT.145685.7987	The leader of the Diko party, Papadopoulos’s former alliance, released a statement.
SNT.145685.7988	Marios Garoyan called the act a "heinous and terrible crime".
SNT.145685.7989	A heavy smoker, Papadopoulos died on the 12th of December, 2008 after a battle with lung cancer.
SNT.145685.7990	He was the President of Cyprus from the 23rd of February, 2003 until 23 February 2008.
SNT.97800.7991	The National Hockey League has announced in a press conference earlier this week that it will open the 2008-09 NHL season with two series' in Europe.
SNT.97800.7992	On October 4 and October 5, the New York Rangers and Tampa Bay Lightning will play in Prague, Czech Republic at the Sazka Arena, and the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins will play in Stockholm, Sweden at the Stockholm Globe Arena.
SNT.97800.7993	Each of the four teams will also play exhibition games in Europe.
SNT.97800.7994	The Rangers will play against Metallurg Magnitogorsk of Russia's elite league in the IIHF-sanctioned Victoria Cup.
SNT.97800.7995	The Senators will play against Frolunda of Sweden's elite league.
SNT.97800.7996	The Lightning and Penguins will play exhibition games in Germany and Finland respectively.
SNT.97800.7997	This will be the second season in a row that the NHL season kicks off with regular season games being played in Europe; at the start of the current 2007-08 season, the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks played games at London's O2 September 28 and September 29.
SNT.62836.7998	Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's cricket coach died at a university hospital in Kingston, Jamaica earlier today.
SNT.62836.7999	Woolmer was found unconscious in his room at the Pegasus Hotel at 10:45 Sunday morning, only hours after Pakistan's Cricket World Cup exit at the hands of Ireland.
SNT.62836.8000	After being found by hotel workers in his room, he was rushed to the emergency department at the University Hospital in Kingston, but doctors where not able to save him.
SNT.62836.8001	Team spokesman Parvez Mir reported that when he was found "He had blood on him and there was vomit on the walls."
SNT.62836.8002	Mir also told media that Woolmer suffered from a medical condition, but that it was too early to decide whether or not it had anything to do with his death.
SNT.62836.8003	Woolmer played 19 Tests for England and was the coach for Warwickshire and South Africa before becoming coach for Pakistan in 2004.
SNT.62836.8004	He was to remain coach until after the 2007 World Cup, and was tipped to replace Duncan Fletcher as the coach of England after his contract with the PCB expired.
SNT.147073.8005	Croatia's ruling Democratic Union (HDZ) party expelled the former prime minister Ivo Sanader following his political comeback Sunday.
SNT.147073.8006	The decision was made after a day-long intra-party meeting led by the party's president and current prime minister Jadranka Kosor, who accused him of trying to split the party and thus make a crisis in the government majority.
SNT.147073.8007	Of twenty two members of the party presidency, 16 voted for expulsion, three were against (Luka Bebić, Mario Zubović and Damir Polančec) and two abstained (Bianca Matković and Petar Selem).
SNT.147073.8008	Mr. Sanader declared he would be returning to a more active role in politics, stating that his decision to withdraw was a mistake, and that the HDZ is a "winning party and not a party that wins 12% of the vote", a remark made in connection with the first round of the presidential election held one week before, in which HDZ's candidate didn't score well.
SNT.147073.8009	He was supported by a dozen HDZ MPs, including the president of the parliament, Bebić.
SNT.147073.8010	Several of those MPs later disclaimed any association with Sanader and claimed they were misled.
SNT.147073.8011	Sanader quit from his PM position in July last year, vowing to quit politics for good, also.
SNT.147073.8012	He held the post since the 2003 parliamentary elections, and it was during his government that Croatia entered NATO.
SNT.102146.8013	Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced today that the HSK Kormoran has been located approximately 112 nautical miles off Steep Point Western Australia.
SNT.102146.8014	Sonar imagery of the Kormoran shows the site consists of two main pieces at a depth of 2560 metres.
SNT.102146.8015	A debris field 4 nautical miles south of the wreck believed to be the site of the battle.
SNT.102146.8016	The Kormoran (HSK 8) was a German auxiliary cruiser of Kriegsmarine during World War II.
SNT.102146.8017	On November 19, 1941, the Kormoran encountered the HMAS Sydney.
SNT.102146.8018	The resulting battle saw the Sydney sunk with the loss of all 645 hands, the Kormoran was scuttled by the crew with the loss of 60, 320 survivors including three Chinese prisoners of war were rescued.
SNT.102146.8019	The loss of the Sydney has been the subject of much controversy, speculation and conspiracy theory.
SNT.102146.8020	There have been many searches for the two vessels, this latest search is by the "Finding Sydney Foundation".
SNT.102146.8021	"Finding the Kormoran is one big step forward," said Prime Minister Rudd.
SNT.102146.8022	"This is an important part in resolving a 65 year old puzzle."
SNT.102146.8023	Warren Snowdon Minister for Defense Science and Personnel said that the Federal Republic of Germany has been advised of the discovery and that the site is to be protected.
SNT.102146.8024	Finding Sydney Foundation Chairman Ted Graham says the search area for the Sydney can now be narrowed down to 300 nautical miles.
SNT.102146.8025	"This gives us a cornerstone if you like, to start the search for the Sydney from," said Graham.
SNT.102146.8026	"So if we hadn't found Kormoron it would have made it much more difficult"
SNT.139598.8027	Friday marks the 50th anniversary of a mining disaster which occured in Lanarkshire, Scotland on September 18, 2009, killing 47 miners.
SNT.139598.8028	Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond MSP unveiled a bronze statue and a memorial garden in Moodiesburn on Sunday in front of a crowd of approximately 600.
SNT.139598.8029	At roughly 0700 BST on September 18, 1959, 47 men who were working in Auchengeich Collery in North Lanarkshire, Scotland were overcome by smoke as they were walking down to start work.
SNT.139598.8030	They were subsequently killed after being trapped by a fire in the mine which prevented them from escaping.
SNT.139598.8031	At the time, a decision had been made to flood the pit after attempts to rescue the men failed.
SNT.139598.8032	It transpired that the fire was caused by an electrical fault 1,000 ft below the surface.
SNT.139598.8033	First Minister Salmond unveiled a memorial garden and a bronze statue which had been placed to mark the 50th anniversary of the incident.
SNT.139598.8034	A religious service was carried out from Bishop Joseph Devine.
SNT.139598.8035	Tom Clarke, MP for Chryston and Bellshill, also attended the event.
SNT.139598.8036	Memorial committee chairman Daniel Taylor read out the names of the late 47 people while another person was playing bagpipes in the background.
SNT.139598.8037	When the service came to a close, First Minister Salmond commented on the tragedy, saying "The tragedy at Auchengeich Colliery left barely a town, village or mining family in North Lanarkshire unaffected."
SNT.139598.8038	"Fifty years on, the memories of the fateful day which claimed the lives of so many husbands, fathers, brothers and sons endure and I am honoured to pay tribute to them."
SNT.139598.8039	"Scotland is fortunate enough to have been blessed with rich natural resources, from the abundant coal seams of the central belt to the oil and gas reserves off our shores and the emerging renewable energy sources we are just beginning to feel the benefits of."
SNT.139598.8040	"But we should never forget the human cost which has come with that."
SNT.139598.8041	"Just as the Piper Alpha tragedy more than two decades ago underlined the hazards of North Sea exploration, the Auchengeich disaster showed all too starkly the dangers and risks which miners all over Scotland took for granted as part of their job every time they descended the pits."
SNT.139598.8042	"The excellent work of the people of North Lanarkshire and Auchengeich Miners' Welfare has provided this new memorial garden and magnificent bronze sculpture."
SNT.139598.8043	"Together, they are a truly fitting tribute to those 47 brave men who died in Auchengeich half a century ago."
SNT.61021.8044	NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope made news this week when it was announced that the space observatory had, for the first time, captured enough light to detect molecules in the atmospheres of planets outside the solar system.
SNT.61021.8045	The planets are too far away to be observed directly with current technology, but by measuring the spectra of each planet when visible with its star, and again when the planet was hidden behind its star, the teams were able to determine the measurements of the planets spectra.
SNT.61021.8046	In a paper published in the February 22 issue of Nature, Dr. Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center presented measurements of HD 209458 b, a hot, Jupiter-like planet located 153 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Pegasus.
SNT.61021.8047	Richardson's team found a peak in the infrared spectra and was able to determine that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b likely consisted of clouds of silicate dust.
SNT.61021.8048	Dr. Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory led another study of HD 209458 b, and found similar results.
SNT.61021.8049	Another team, led by Dr. Carl Grillmair of Spitzer Science Center at Caltech, performed a similar study of HD 189733b, 63 light-years away, in the constellation Vulpecula.
SNT.61021.8050	Dr. Grillmair discusses the results: “It was believed to be fairly straightforward that these planets would have a lot of water in them, for one thing, very hot water."
SNT.61021.8051	"These planets, these hot Jupiters very, very close in to their parent stars are 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit or so, so it's not a pleasant place to live."
SNT.61021.8052	"And what we found instead and what the other group found for this completely different planet around another star, is that the spectrum is essentially flat."
SNT.61021.8053	"It really doesn't show any of the features we would have expected from water."
SNT.61021.8054	"The theorists' heads were spinning when they saw the data," adds Dr. Richardson.
SNT.61021.8055	"It is virtually impossible for water, in the form of vapor, to be absent from the planet, so it must be hidden, probably by the dusty cloud layer we detected in our spectrum."
SNT.61021.8056	Dr. Grillmair: "The observations are showing us that things are not the way we expected them."
SNT.61021.8057	"And so there'll be a big push to get a lot more data while Spitzer is still alive."
SNT.61021.8058	"I think this will ultimately be one of the most important legacies of the Spitzer Space Telescope, unanticipated as it was before launch."
SNT.61021.8059	"I think it will become extremely important in the future."
SNT.61021.8060	The telescope was launched in August of 2003 with a maximum expected life cycle of 5 years.
SNT.61021.8061	"With these new observations, we are refining the tools that we will one day need to find life elsewhere if it exists," said Swain.
SNT.61021.8062	Dr. Swain's and Dr. Grillmair's studies are pending publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters.
SNT.84295.8063	The South Carolina Democratic Party denied Stephen Colbert a place on the primary ballot Thursday.
SNT.84295.8064	“The council really agonized over this because they really like him, they love his show, and everyone thinks it’s wonderful that he cares about us,” said Carol Fowler, the chairwoman of the state’s Democratic Party.
SNT.84295.8065	According to their statement, Colbert did not meet two basic requirements: that he be a viable national candidate; and that he actively campaign for the state’s primary.
SNT.84295.8066	"It's a distraction," said Waring Howe Jr., one of the executive council member who voted against Colbert, "and takes away from the seriousness of our primary here and takes attention from the serious candidates: Clinton, Edwards, Barack Obama and the rest."
SNT.84295.8067	Colbert's Thursday night program centered around his campaign in South Carolina until a Democratic official called mid-show with the news of the council's rejection.
SNT.84295.8068	Colbert had originally announced his intention to run as both a Republican and Democrat, but only filed for the Democratic.
SNT.84295.8069	The Republican primary ballot application cost was $35,000, versus $2,500 for the Democratic application.
SNT.9110.8070	The government passed a law on Friday ratifying Romania's accession treaty to the European Union, after the Treaty was signed in a ceremony in Luxembourg in April 25, which was attended by the heads of state of all 25 current EU member states.
SNT.9110.8071	The government pointed out that, aside from ratification by Romania and Bulgaria, the two states which signed the accession treaty in April 25, the treaty must also be ratified by the 25 current member states who also signed the treaty in Luxembourg.
SNT.9110.8072	The law passed by the Romanian government on Friday has been forwarded to the Parliament to be debated.
SNT.9110.8073	It must be approved in a joint session of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, with at least a two-thirds majority.
SNT.9110.8074	Once the accession treaty is ratified by all 25 member states of the European Union, Romania and Bulgaria will become full members in January 1, 2007.
SNT.76703.8075	On the 3rd day of the 2007 World Deaf Swimming Championships, the Men 1500m Freestyle, Women 800m Freestyle, 50m Breaststroke, 200m Freestyle, 4x100m Medley Relay Groups finales took place during the afternoon and evening.
SNT.76703.8076	Belarus deaf swimmer Natalia Deeva not only broke old "women 50m breaststroke record" established by her teammate Aksana Petrushenka on June 19, 2006 with 35.28 seconds at 50m Breaststroke heat session within 34.97 seconds, but also broke her record again at final session within 34.91 seconds.
SNT.76703.8077	Besides of individual record, Natalia Deeva and Aksana Petrushenka also participated Women 4x100m Medley Relay Group Final, not only won the 1st place, but also broke former record established by Russian National Team on January 10, 2005 with 4 minute and 39.63 seconds at that group final within 4 minute and 38 seconds.
SNT.76703.8078	With the three-times new world records written, that's exactly a "New Record Day" for Belarus.
SNT.76703.8079	Even though heats and finales were still in process, but due to a torrential rain in Taiwan, the Award Ceremony of 3rd Matchday has been postponed to next matchday.
SNT.84439.8080	Earlier today, the government of Chad set free three French journalists and four Spanish flight attendants, who had been held since October 25.
SNT.84439.8081	Chadian authorities had been investigating the role of the seven and 14 other suspects with regard to an attempt to fly 103 African children to Europe for placement with host families.
SNT.84439.8082	The release of the seven came as French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrived in Chad to hold talks on the case with Chadian officials.
SNT.84439.8083	The lawyer for the seven, Jean-Bernard Padare, told Reuters that the seven were free to collect their belongings from the courthouse.
SNT.84439.8084	A French charity, Zoe's Ark, had arranged for the 103 children to be flown out of Chad in an attempt to rescue them from the humanitarian crisis created as a result of the neighbouring Darfur conflict.
SNT.84439.8085	However, Chadian officials have since described the operation as "kidnapping" and "extortion", while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees revealed that many of the children involved were not orphans.
SNT.84439.8086	According to Radio France, Eric Breteau, the founder of Zoe's Ark charity, spoke at a pretrial hearing in N'Djamena, Chad and stated that the seven released Europeans had not been involved with the charity's plans.
SNT.84439.8087	Ten other Europeans are still being held in Chad and are facing child abduction and fraud charges.
SNT.22021.8088	The August Bank Holiday weekend, as usual, played host to many festivals and musical events around the UK, not least the Camel Rock Festival held at Porthcressa on the Isles of Scilly.
SNT.22021.8089	Local bands included those formed at the Five Islands' School, the members of the Steamband under the temporary name Senile Shambles and the rhythm and blues band, Roadrunner.
SNT.22021.8090	The event, deemed 'unique' in the local press, raises money for local musical projects on the islands.
SNT.22021.8091	It's future is, as always, in doubt due to the amount of work for organisers and volunteers, especially for the clean-up operation.
SNT.22021.8092	Organiser Paul Lewis hopes that the event will return next year as long as there are still volunteers.
SNT.6748.8093	In response to the United States Department of State issuing its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, China has issued a contradictory report highlighting human rights abuses in the US, The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2004.
SNT.6748.8094	For the past six years, the People's Republic of China has issued an annual statement on human rights in the US in response to the annual report on China.
SNT.6748.8095	"Only the Chinese people themselves have the right to comment on the human rights situation in their own country," said Liu Jianchao, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
SNT.6748.8096	The US State Department, beginning in 1977, issues annual country reviews of its perceptions of the rights records of individual nations, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
SNT.6748.8097	The current report for 2004, released on February 28, 2005, contains candid assessments and detailed criticism of the human rights records of 192 countries, including China.
SNT.6748.8098	Amnesty International, the international 'watch-dog organization' for human rights, has however criticized this paper as being biased, because it is made by a government which itself is violating human rights on many sectors.
SNT.6748.8099	Amnesty International's 2004 annual report on US human rights in 2003 agrees with many of these claims.
SNT.6748.8100	Amnesty is also worried about: severe violations committed by the United States' army outside the countries' borders; the situation of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay; United States' general misbehaviour against international peace; ill-treatment of US immigrants; ill-treatment and excessive use of force by the US law enforcement officials; the US citizens losing civil rights and liberties after the 9/11 attacks; and continued use of death penalty by the state, which is in direct breach with the 3rd article of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights (the right to life).
SNT.6748.8101	Comment by Peter Edidin of The New York Times, characterized the Chinese report as "a frank indictment [that] draws a picture of America that approaches caricature.
SNT.6748.8102	But that doesn't mean it won't buttress the negative image of the United States held by its critics around the world."
SNT.6748.8103	This ongoing dispute does not capture the entire relationship of US and China on civil rights.
SNT.6748.8104	Even as both sides trade accusations, the US on March 18, 2005, declined to table a resolution at the UN criticizing China, citing the ongoing improvements that are being made in that country.
SNT.6748.8105	This is the second time in three years that the US has not submitted such a resolution, which in fact has never passed the UN when it was submitted before.
SNT.124267.8106	Adam is a robot developed by Welsh Aberystwyth University researchers which combines artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and automation to independently conduct and analyse biological laboratory research.
SNT.124267.8107	"What's new and exciting about Adam is [it is] the first time we've managed to show that a computer can not only think up new scientific ideas, but experimentally test them and decide whether they're true," said Ross King, a computer science professor and lead researcher at Aberystwyth University, "Adam makes up its own mind what to do.
SNT.124267.8108	He says that for other lab experiments the hardware is already in place, the only step needed is to change the software.
SNT.124267.8109	The artificial intelligence alone spans three computers which holds the databases and analytical software to enable Adam to think.
SNT.124267.8110	For the yeast experiment, Adam was loaded with databases which hold known information relating to yeasts and organisms.
SNT.124267.8111	Adam compared all fields in the database to find the areas of missing information from which he devised 20 hypotheses.
SNT.124267.8112	Adam's AI is connected to robotic arms, sensors, incubators and cameras which enable Adam to start over 1,000 individual experiments every day and follow their progress over a week.
SNT.124267.8113	A part of the process is that Adam's AI can cycle and analyze the results of the experiments as well doing routine repetitious lab work.
SNT.124267.8114	Following Adam's testing, King's team manually tested three of Adam's hypotheses and found that the robot's conclusions were correct, and each was a breakthrough to the scientific community.
SNT.124267.8115	William Melek, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Ontario's University of Waterloo, has noted that to set up the AI needed for subsequent experiments involving new biological variables and criteria, the human expertise would be time consuming to customize it.
SNT.124267.8116	The usefulness would be limited therefore to the allotment of human input needed to set up Adam.
SNT.124267.8117-1	David Waltz of Columbia University and Bruce Buchanan of the University of Pittsburgh say that "For the foreseeable future, the prospect of using automated systems as assistants holds vast promise as these assistants are becoming not only faster but much broader in their capabilities -- more knowledgeable, more creative, and more self-reflective," 
SNT.124267.8117-2	They note the potential of such lab assistants which may more efficiently process the research data.
SNT.124267.8118	It was reported that Adam cost about $1million in production costs and this was weighed against the costs of hiring lab techs.
SNT.124267.8119	King said, We made many mistakes and learned from Adam.
SNT.124267.8120	Eve is the second AI computer under development by Professor King's research team.

SNT.253922.8122	The national football team of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been banned by FIFA, the sport's international governing body.
SNT.253922.8123	The ban comes after the Bosnian Football Federation (NSBIH) rejected a demand from FIFA to change its three-man presidency to a single president.
SNT.253922.8124	The change was rejected on Wednesday during an NSBIH meeting, causing FIFA and European football governing body UEFA to make the decision to suspend the federation.
SNT.253922.8125	FIFA and UEFA said in a statement that "[t]he NSBIH representative and club teams are no longer entitled to take part in international competitions as of 1 April 2011 and until the aforementioned problem is solved.
SNT.253922.8126	This also means that, as of 1 April 2011, no NSIBH official or representative may participate in any international match or event."
SNT.253922.8127	The Bosnia and Herzegovina national team's manager, Safet Susic, spoke out against FIFA's ruling, blaming politics for the demand not being met.
SNT.253922.8128	He said "[t]here is absolutely no chance that the NSBIH might find a way out of the present deadlock and get the job done.
SNT.253922.8129	These people are incapable of running the NSBIH properly, although this situation is partly a result of political orders because Bosnia is an ethnically divided country where a dysfunctional system has now caught up with football.
SNT.253922.8130	Denying the players a chance to perform on the big stage through no fault of their own is like sending innocent people to prison."
SNT.253922.8131	Bosnia and Herzegovina are currently competing in the qualifying stage of the 2012 European championship.
SNT.253922.8132	Bosnia are only five points behind group leaders France, and hold a game in hand over both Belarus and Albania.
SNT.253922.8133	Unless FIFA's ruling is reversed, it seems unlikely that Bosnia's next game against Romania on June 3 will take place.
SNT.1052509.8134	As part of peace talks between and the , Israel released on Tuesday early in the morning 26 Palestinian prisoners imprisoned before the 1994 for murder or attempted murder of Israelis.
SNT.1052509.8135	As a prerequisite for the peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians led by the US, Israel committed in July to free 104 prisoners imprisoned before the Oslo accords.
SNT.1052509.8136	In this wave, the third out of four, Israel freed 26 Palestinian prisoners out of 'Ofer' prison in Israel.
SNT.1052509.8137	The prisoners, who had been in Israeli prison for 19–28 years, were released to the , to the , and to Jerusalem where enthusiastic crowds waited for them.
SNT.1052509.8138	The prisoners released to the West Bank in were welcomed by the president of the Palestinian National Authority, , at the presidential residence, and put flowers on Palestinian leader 's tomb.
SNT.1052509.8139	Abbas, speaking before thousands of people gathered for the prisoners' release, said, "We will not sign a final peace deal with Israel before all the prisoners are released".
SNT.1052509.8140	Israel confirmed the release on Saturday, but delayed it until Tuesday for an Israeli court appeal by victims' families to prevent it.
SNT.1052509.8141	The appeal filed by the 'Almagor' organization representing the Israeli victims' families was not accepted.
SNT.1052509.8142	Addressing the issue, the Israeli Prime Minister, , said at the meeting of his party, "Leadership is judged by the ability to implement decisions, difficult as they may be.
SNT.66306.8143	The man accused of killing a Laval, Quebec police officer on March 2, 2007 was released Tuesday on a CA$200,000 bail.
SNT.66306.8144	Basil Parasiris has been charged with several offences stemming from a drug raid carried out by police in the early morning hours of March 2.
SNT.66306.8145	Among the alleged offences are a first-degree murder charge in the shooting death of Constable Daniel Tessier, attempted murder in the wounding of Tessier's partner, Stephane Forbes, and several weapons offences.
SNT.66306.8146	Parasiris will remain free on bail pending a preliminary hearing to be held in August of this year.
SNT.66306.8147	For his part, Parasiris has not denied that the shooting took place, and has apologized to Tessier's family.
SNT.66306.8148	He claims that he was acting in self defence, as he didn't know that it was police entering his house in a planned raid, and instead believed intruders had broken in.
SNT.66306.8149	My condolences to the Tessier family," Parasiris told CTV News.
SNT.66306.8150	"I honestly thought there was a home invasion or something."
SNT.66306.8151	The judge overseeing the bail proceedings, ruled that Parasiris would not pose an immediate threat to society, but did place strict conditions on his release.
SNT.66306.8152	While awaiting trial, Parasiris, 41, will have to live with his father, obey a curfew, and not travel outside Canada.
SNT.66306.8153	In what is believed to be the first ruling of its kind in Canada, releasing on bail a defendant charged with killing a policeman, the judge criticized some of the police tactics used during the raid.
SNT.66306.8154	Justice Jean-Guy Boilard of the Quebec Superior Court noted that the police didn't use a "knock notice" before entering Parasiris' house, but rather used a battering ram to break down the door.
SNT.66306.8155	When serving a warrant under normal conditions, police are to knock at the door and identify themselves.
SNT.66306.8156	Jacques Larochelle, Parasiris' lawyer, indicated that he will contest the warrant's legality.
SNT.66306.8157	The prosecution argued that, even if it was not clear to Parasiris that police were entering his home, he should not have been so reckless with a gun.
SNT.66306.8158	During the fatal raid on the Parasiris home in March, police collected four loaded handguns, as well as a small amount of drugs and cash.
SNT.66306.8159	According to reports, the 357-magnum handgun allegedly used by Parasiris to shoot the officers was legally registered.
SNT.9058.8160	Wildlife scientists confirmed on Thursday that a bird long thought extinct, the Ivory-billed woodpecker, has been found in Arkansas.
SNT.9058.8161	The remarkable birds have a 30-inch wingspan and stand nearly 20 inches high.
SNT.9058.8162	The birds inhabited a wide swath of American bottomlands and mountain pine forests until the latter part of the 1800s.
SNT.9058.8163	They require a large feeding ground, and it is thought the expansion of towns and cities closed off their domain.
SNT.9058.8164	Ornithologists say each mating pair of Ivory-billed woodpeckers needs three square miles of forest to survive.
SNT.9058.8165	There were thought to be only 22 of them left in 1938.
SNT.9058.8166	There have been several independent sightings of the bird in Arkansas over the last year, and even a videotape.
SNT.9058.8167	In an effort to support the birds, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, The Nature Conservancy, and other groups have joined to form the Big Woods Conservation Partnership to conserve 200,000 acres of forest habitat and rivers in the area during the next 10 years.
SNT.9058.8168	John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology told the Associated Press, "the bird captured on video is clearly an ivory-billed woodpecker.
SNT.9058.8169	Amazingly, America may have another chance to protect the future of this spectacular bird and the awesome forests in which it lives."
SNT.9058.8170	The story premiered Thursday in the online version of Science magazine.
SNT.24133.8171	Spanish police believe they are close to capturing Aribert Heim, the 91-year-old known as "Dr. Death".
SNT.24133.8172	Dr. Heim, described by The Times as "the most wanted Nazi still believed to be alive", is thought to be living in the town of Palafrugell in the Costa Brava area of Spain.
SNT.24133.8173	Heim worked as a doctor in a number of Nazi Germany concentration camps (Mauthausen, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald) carrying out a series of experiments on the camp's Jewish inmates.
SNT.24133.8174	His experiments reportedly included operating on a patient without anaesthetic to see how much pain a human being could endure, and injecting petrol into the bloodstream, then timing how long it took for the victim to die.
SNT.24133.8175	Hundreds of people are believed to have died as a result of these experiments.
SNT.24133.8176	The Times reports that Heim led a normal civilian life after the end of the Second World War, but fled Germany in 1962, when the authorities were about to issue a warrant for his arrest.
SNT.24133.8177	Nazi hunters, including researchers from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, have been looking for him ever since.
SNT.24133.8178	The center's founder, Simon Wiesenthal, was himself active in pursuing Heim prior to his death last month.
SNT.24133.8179	German police received a tip six weeks ago by an Israeli citizen who met a man in Ibiza with characteristics similar to Heim.
SNT.24133.8180	Other evidence pointing the trail to Palafrugell involve banking transfers and tax filings.

SNT.195148.8186	Traralgon bounced back after their loss to Morwell with a 73 point victory over Sale in round thirteen of the Gippsland Football League.
SNT.195148.8187	The Gippsland League is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.
SNT.195148.8188	Traralgon's defence held strong as the team went inside their attacking fifty 63 times to Sales 57.
SNT.195148.8189	Sale, however, lead the centre clearances 35 to Traralgon's 27.
SNT.195148.8190	The victory moves Traralgon back to second, a game clear of Morwell, who lost to Maffra by 32 points.
SNT.105371.8191	After 1,581 consecutive days (just shy of 4 years and 4 months), David Witthoft of Connecticut has stopped wearing his #4 Brett Favre jersey.
SNT.105371.8192	The Ridgefield, Connecticut boy, 12, wore the No. 4 jersey every day after receiving it as a gift for Christmas in 2003.
SNT.105371.8193	David's father, Chuck, said Monday that his son's last day wearing the jersey was April 23--his 12th birthday.
SNT.105371.8194	Witthoft conceded his son was starting to become more concerned about his appearance after the jersey barely came down to his belt line.
SNT.105371.8195	In 2007, Witthoft said he "would keep wearing it as long as [he] could get it over [his] head."
SNT.105371.8196	His mother, Carolyn, had washed the jersey every other day and mended it when needed.
SNT.105371.8197	Witthoft first gained national attention three years ago and attended his first Green Bay Packers game in December 2007 (a 34-13 Packers victory over the Detroit Lions).
SNT.105371.8198	He's also planning to attend the September 8 game when the Packers retire Favre's No. 4 against the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football.
SNT.105371.8199	Witthoft has considered sending the jersey to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.
SNT.3209.8200	Charles Graner guilty of abusing prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison.
SNT.3209.8201	Graner, 36, was described as the ringleader during his four-day trial before a military jury.
SNT.3209.8202	He pleaded innocent to the five charges brought against him, but the ten person jury took five hours to find him guilty.
SNT.3209.8203	During the trial, video and photographs taken inside the prison in November 2003 were presented to the court.
SNT.3209.8204	The photographs were made public in early 2004 bringing the world's attention to the abuses going on in the prison.
SNT.3209.8205	It is alleged that senior US defence officials knew of the abuse, including the Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld.
SNT.3209.8206	Garner's defense maintained that he was acting under orders to 'soften up' detainees before interrogation.
SNT.115643.8207	Local authorities in Chicago, Illinois, United States have asked that the FBI help in the murder and kidnap investigation of the relatives of singer and Academy Award winning actress Jennifer Hudson.
SNT.115643.8208	On Friday, Hudson's Mother Darnell Donerson, 57 and brother, Jason, 29, were shot and killed in the Southern Chicago home in what authorities are calling a domestic dispute.
SNT.115643.8209	A cousin had found the bodies at around 2:44 p.m. (CDT) and called 9-1-1.
SNT.115643.8210	Hudson's nephew, 7-year-old Julian King, was kidnapped from the scene and has not been seen since.
SNT.115643.8211	An AMBER Alert was issued and police are looking for a 1994 white Chevrolet Suburban or a teal-green Chrysler Concorde.
SNT.115643.8212	King's mother, Julia Hudson, who was previously reported missing, is pleading for whoever has her son, to release him.
SNT.115643.8213	"I don't care who you are, just let the baby go.
SNT.115643.8214	I don't know what else to do but pray," said Hudson during a press conference on Saturday.
SNT.115643.8215	The FBI was called in because authorities suspected King might have been taken over state lines.
SNT.115643.8216	Police have detained and questioned several people, and some reports say that includes William Balfour, who police previous thought to have kidnapped King.
SNT.115643.8217	Reports say he is Julia's ex-boyfriend, having since been separated.
SNT.115643.8218	Police deny that he is a suspect in either the murders or kidnapping and will not confirm or deny if he is or was in custody.
SNT.115643.8219	So far no charges have been filed against anyone for the crimes.
SNT.97063.8220	The Argentinian federal judge Olga Arrabal ordered closure of public rebroadcasting station in Mendoza Province at request of Vila-Manzano Group, a monopolistic media conglomerate.
SNT.97063.8221	The judge ordered the cessation of broadcasts by the local relay transmitter of Canal 7 television station in Mendoza's capital.
SNT.97063.8222	The country's Media Secretary, Public Broadcasting System and Channel 7 will appeal the resolution of the Second Federal Court of Mendoza.
SNT.97063.8223	"We are going to do everything necessary to defend the right to the information", said Rosario Lufrano, the executive director of Canal 7.
SNT.97063.8224	In addition, she added that they would go to Mendoza all the times that be necessary, since they had done it with San Rafael, to achieve that all the citizens have free and free access to the unique national channel that has Argentina.
SNT.97063.8225	In 2007, Channel 7 had installed new relay in the cities of Mar del Plata, Bariloche, Neuquén, Santa Rosa, Comodoro Rivadavia, San Rafael and Mendoza.
SNT.97063.8226	Nevertheless, in San Rafael and Mendoza they had problems, due to the judicial presentations made by Vila-Manzano Group's companies.
SNT.97063.8227	A Commission of Neighbors called for a day of mobilization for the next January 30 in the downtown of Mendoza, to repudiate the measure adopted by the judge.
SNT.131013.8228	Seven people are dead after a suicide bomber attacked a convoy of Western soldiers in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan on Tuesday.
SNT.131013.8229	Security officials say the bomber drove his vehicle into the convoy on the Jalalabad road, which is notorious for being the scene of frequent attacks by the Taleban.
SNT.131013.8230	"I saw wounded people and dead people everywhere," a shopkeeper named Sawad told the Reuters news agency.
SNT.131013.8231	"I helped some people to ambulances, their clothes were covered in blood stains."
SNT.131013.8232	Two Afghan staff from the United Nations are feared to be among the casualties from the attack.
SNT.131013.8233	"I am shocked and greatly saddened to have learned that two of my staff members were among those killed in today's suicide bombing," said Kai Eide, the special representative for the UN.
SNT.131013.8234	The violence comes before Thursday's presidential election, which militants have promised to disrupt.
SNT.131013.8235	Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai has said the attacks wouldn't deter citizens from voting, who would cast their ballots "despite the efforts of the enemies and will show their opposition to their barbaric acts."
SNT.103970.8236	American Major League Baseball relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain of the New York Yankees returned a call to his sister after an 8-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox Sunday night.
SNT.103970.8237	After speaking with his sister who was in Lincoln, Nebraska, he was in tears and being consoled by manager Joe Girardi.
SNT.103970.8238	Joba's father, Harlan Chamberlain, 55, collapsed at his home in Lincoln, and is currently at St. Elizabeth Regional Medical Center.
SNT.103970.8239	Although the exact nature of his collapse is unknown, Harlan, a full-blooded Winnebago Native American, has struggled with post-polio syndrome since childhood.
SNT.103970.8240	He has been known to be in declining health in recent years.
SNT.103970.8241	Still, Harlan was in attendance at Yankee Stadium during the team's Opening Day series this year.
SNT.103970.8242	He also drove down to Kansas City, only three hours away from Lincoln, when the Yankees visited the Kansas City Royals.
SNT.103970.8243	He made the same trips last year when Joba made his much-anticipated Major League debut.
SNT.103970.8244	Joba has been granted leave from the team to be with his father, and will not be with the Yankees at least during their two-game series against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.
SNT.86038.8245	Senior officials from nearly 50 countries and international organizations have gathered in Annapolis, Maryland near Washington, D.C. for a conference aimed at launching final-status peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
SNT.86038.8246	The meeting, the product of months of Middle East diplomacy by the Bush administration, is intended to reopen peace talks between the two sides for the first time in seven years.
SNT.86038.8247	The conference, hosted by the United States Department of State, has been dubbed the Annapolis Conference.
SNT.86038.8248	"Our purpose here in Annapolis is not to conclude an agreement.
SNT.86038.8249	Rather, it is to launch negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians," said President George W. Bush at the first formal session of the conference.
SNT.86038.8250	"The time is right, the cause is just, and with hard effort, I know they can succeed."
SNT.86038.8251	Bush said that direct negotiations for a Palestinian state will begin December 12.
SNT.86038.8252	"Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom, purpose and dignity," Bush said.
SNT.86038.8253	He hopes a solution be found before he leaves office.
SNT.86038.8254	As the summit got underway, thousands of people demonstrated in Gaza City.
SNT.86038.8255	"Let them go to a thousand conferences, we say in the name of the Palestinian people that we did not authorise anyone to sign any agreement that harms our rights," said Mahmoud al-Zahar, a co-founder of Hamas.
SNT.86038.8256	Mahmoud Abbas has no right to make concessions to the Israelis he said.
SNT.86038.8257	"Abbas is a traitor" and "Death to Israel, death to America," the crowd chanted.
SNT.86038.8258	The Prime Minster of Israel, Ehud Olmert said: "This time it's different because we are going to have lots of participants in what I hope will launch a serious process of negotiations between us and the Palestinians."
SNT.86038.8259	Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority said: "We have a great deal of hope that this conference will produce... expanded negotiations over all permanent-status issues that would lead to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian people."
SNT.86038.8260	Observers have noted that the summit has attracted the participation of Saudi Arabia and Syria—two Arab states that do not recognize Israel—and say that this is critical to chances for success.
SNT.86038.8261	The conference began informally last night with a dinner hosted by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
SNT.86038.8262	"We've come together this week because we share a common goal: two democratic states—Israel and Palestine—living side by side in peace and security," Bush said in an address to the participants.
SNT.86038.8263	Achieving this goal requires the commitment of the international community, including the United States," he continued.
SNT.104173.8264	Indonesia has been angered by a decision of the European Union to leave all 51 of the nation's air carriers on the list of air carriers banned in the EU.
SNT.104173.8265	State-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia had hoped to begin flights to Europe imminently and has ordered ten new jetliners to serve routes there and to the United States.
SNT.104173.8266	Transport ministry spokesperson Bambang Ervan said "This seems like an unfair punishment for Indonesia.
SNT.104173.8267	The EU is not a sovereign country and is not a member of the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation).
SNT.104173.8268	But we do respect the EU and its decision, and demand the same from the EU."
SNT.104173.8269	The ban was imposed after a string of accidents, of which the three most important were Adam Air Flight 574, a 102-fatality accident in which a Boeing 737-43Q plunged into the ocean after pilots distracted by instrument failure failed to maintain control, Adam Air Flight 172, in which another B737 snapped in half after a hard landing and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, in which a third B737 attempted landing at extreme speed and overshot the runway, killing 21.
SNT.104173.8270	Adam Air had also almost suffered a B737 crash the previous year, 2006, after a similar navigational instrument failure to that on Flight 574 caused the airliner to become lost for several hours, eventually performing an emergency landing hundreds of kilometres from its intended destination.
SNT.104173.8271	Indonesia grounded the carrier in March after another accident in which a B737 overshot a runway.
SNT.104173.8272	The carrier is also in severe financial difficulties and may soon be permanently shut down.
SNT.104173.8273	Meanwhile, the pilot of Garuda 200 has been charged over the accident, sparking intense controversy.
SNT.104173.8274	The EU reviewed the ban this week, but ruled that those responsible "have still to demonstrate that they have completed the corrective actions" needed to lift the ban.
SNT.104173.8275	It is a blow to Indonesia, who had promised "fast-track" help to Garuda, Mandala Airlines, Premiair and Airfast to raise their safety to levels acceptable to the EU.
SNT.76127.8276	Bai Yun, a Giant Panda, has given birth Friday at the San Diego Zoo, after two and a half hours in labor.
SNT.76127.8277	After birth, the cub was immediately taken into the arms of its mother.
SNT.76127.8278	Bai Yun has had three other cubs, Hua Mei, 1999, Mei Sheng, 2003, and Su Lin, 2005.
SNT.76127.8279	The newborn cub's gender is not yet known - zookeepers want to avoid going close to the cub for a few days, and are watching on a closed-circuit camera.
SNT.76127.8280	While Bai Yun has been relatively fertile in captivity, other animals have had difficulty mating.
SNT.76127.8281	Since these pandas possess extremely low hormonal desires for sex, scientists in China have recently developed a method involving "panda porn" to induce the animals into mating.
SNT.76127.8282	Bai Yun, however, seems to be getting along just fine, producing her previous two cubs with a male panda named Gao Gao.
SNT.76127.8283	Dr. Ron Swaisgood, who helped deliver the newest cub, has said that “Gao Gao is a very proficient mater.”
SNT.111743.8284	United States (U.S.) Senator Joe Lieberman is scheduled to speak at the Republican party convention, according to a member of the McCain campaign who wishes to remain anonymous.
SNT.111743.8285	Lieberman, who was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in the 2000 presidential election, has been one of Republican party candidate, John McCain's, staunchest supporters.
SNT.111743.8286	The official who informed the press of this announcement stated that Lieberman is slated to speak on the second day, a Monday, of the convention.
SNT.111743.8287	There has been a lot of speculation in the past months that Lieberman would speak at the convention.
SNT.111743.8288	In a interview with David Brody of CBN, Lieberman stated in response to the question about the possibility of him being at the convention that, "well, it's not clear yet but you might just see me there."
SNT.111743.8289	Lieberman is currently in Georgia, with Senator Lindsey Graham; he responded when asked if he would be speaking at the convention that "it's quite possible, but I'll let them announce it."
SNT.111743.8290	Lieberman has been recently considered a possible candidate for the Republican vice presidential seat.
SNT.111743.8291	The convention will be held in St. Paul, Minnesota from September 1 through the 4th.
SNT.111743.8292	He is currently a Independent Senator in Connecticut, who caucuses with the Democratic party.
SNT.111743.8293	Lieberman was the Democratic vice presidential candidate back in 2000, when he ran with Al Gore.
SNT.121213.8294	The European Court of Human Rights has awarded €2500 to Abu Qatada, an Islamic militant and cleric, in a lawsuit he filed against the United Kingdom which detained him without trial in 2002.
SNT.121213.8295	Qatada, who is facing extradition to Jordan to serve a life sentence for terrorism charges, and 10 others were detained under Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.
SNT.121213.8296	This act allowed foreign nationals suspected of terrorism to be detained, before being repealed in 2004 due to its discriminatory nature.
SNT.121213.8297	The ECHR's ruling determined the decision to detain Qatada under this law breached the 'right to liberty and security' secured in the European Convention of Human Rights.
SNT.121213.8298	The British government claimed they believed the people detained were "a threat to our national security."
SNT.121213.8299	Some British politicians also objected to paying compensation to people believed to be terrorists.
SNT.121213.8300	Matthew Elliot, a lobbyist for the Taxpayers' Alliance, argued: "This man hates everything Britain stands for, so it is disgusting that ordinary taxpayers are now forced to pay him thousands of pounds."
SNT.121213.8301	Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary commented: "This decision will horrify most reasonable people in the UK … it makes a mockery of the concept of human rights if we can't protect ourselves against people who are out to destroy our society."
SNT.25712.8302	Thousands of protestors demonstrated today in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
SNT.25712.8303	They left their houses due to unrest over the results of the November 6 parliamentary elections, which, according to the opposition, are faked.
SNT.25712.8304	The protest lasted about three hours before being shut down.
SNT.25712.8305	The protest gathered some 15,000 people, but the opposition hoped to gather 30,000 to 50,000 Azeris.
SNT.25712.8306	Many people were stopped by police on their way to the outskirts of Baku.
SNT.25712.8307	When rioters tried to enlarge the protest, police used force to stop them.
SNT.25712.8308	Some Azeris believe that a "three hour revolution" wouldn't change anything in the country.
SNT.25712.8309	They believe that the demonstration was controlled by the government.
SNT.25712.8310	The November 6 elections, won, according to officials, by the governing New Azerbaijan Party, have been condemned by international organizations, such as The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and by independent observers.
SNT.25712.8311	The Council of Europe reports that results in about 43% of polling stations were faked.
SNT.25712.8312	To prevent protests, re-runs were ordered in two districts by election officials.
SNT.82657.8313	Torture proliferates American headlines today: whether its use is defensible in certain contexts and the morality of the practice.
SNT.82657.8314	Wikinews reporter David Shankbone was curious about torture in American popular culture.
SNT.82657.8315	This is the first of a two part series examining the BDSM business.
SNT.82657.8316	This interview focuses on the owners of a dungeon, what they charge, what the clients are like and how they handle their needs.
SNT.82657.8317	When Shankbone rings the bell of "HC & Co." he has no idea what to expect.
SNT.82657.8318	A BDSM (Bondage Discipline Sadism Masochism) dungeon is a legal enterprise in New York City, and there are more than a few businesses that cater to a clientèle that wants an enema, a spanking, to be dressed like a baby or to wear women's clothing.
SNT.82657.8319	Shankbone went to find out what these businesses are like, who runs them, who works at them, and who frequents them.
SNT.82657.8320	He spent three hours one night in what is considered one of the more upscale establishments in Manhattan, Rebecca's Hidden Chamber, where according to The Village Voice, "you can take your girlfriend or wife, and have them treated with respect—unless they hope to be treated with something other than respect!"
SNT.82657.8321	When Shankbone arrived on the sixth floor of a midtown office building, the elevator opened up to a hallway where a smiling Rebecca greeted him.
SNT.82657.8322	She is a beautiful forty-ish Long Island mother of three who is dressed in smart black pants and a black turtleneck that reaches up to her blond-streaked hair pulled back in a bushy ponytail.
SNT.82657.8323	"Are you David Shankbone? We're so excited to meet you!" she says, and leads him down the hall to a living room area with a sofa, a television playing an action-thriller, an open supply cabinet stocked with enema kits, and her husband Bill sitting at the computer trying to find where the re-release of Blade Runner is playing at the local theater.
SNT.82657.8324	Perhaps the most poignant moment came at the end of the night when Shankbone was waiting to be escorted out (to avoid running into a client).
SNT.82657.8325	Rebecca came into the room and sat on the sofa.
SNT.82657.8326	"You know, a lot of people out there would like to see me burn for what I do," she says.
SNT.82657.8327	Rebecca is a woman who has faced challenges in her life, and dealt with them the best she could given her circumstances.
SNT.82657.8328	She sees herself as providing a service to people who have needs, no matter how debauched the outside world deems them.
SNT.82657.8329	They sat talking mutual challenges they have faced and politics (she's supporting Hillary); Rebecca reflected upon the irony that many of the people who supported the torture at Abu Ghraib would want her closed down.
SNT.82657.8330	It was in this conversation that Shankbone saw that humanity can be found anywhere, including in places that appear on the surface to cater to the inhumanity some people in our society feel towards themselves, or others.
SNT.82657.8331	"The best way to describe it," says Bill, "is if you had a kink, and you had a wife and you had two kids, and every time you had sex with your wife it just didn't hit the nail on the head.
SNT.82657.8332-1	What would you do about it?
SNT.82657.8332-2	How would you handle it?
SNT.82657.8332-3	You might go through life feeling unfulfilled.
SNT.82657.8333	Or you might say, 'No, my kink is I really need to dress in women's clothing.'
SNT.82657.8334	We're not the evil devil out here, plucking people off the street, keeping them chained up for days on end."
SNT.82657.8335	Below is David Shankbone's interview with Bill & Rebecca, owners of Rebecca's Hidden Chamber, a BDSM dungeon.
SNT.96322.8336	The militant Islamist group Taliban attacked a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan last night.
SNT.96322.8337	Seven people, including a U.S. citizen and a journalist from the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet were killed.
SNT.96322.8338	Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre is staying at the hotel, but was unharmed.
SNT.96322.8339	The terrorists attacked the five-star Serena hotel with AK-47 assault rifles, suicide vests, and grenades.
SNT.96322.8340	The likely target was Mr. Gahr Støre and a Norwegian delegation, who evacuated into the cellar.
SNT.96322.8341	U.S. military forced rushed to the scene, and managed to kill at least one of the attackers.
SNT.96322.8342	Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility shortly after the attack.
SNT.96322.8343	White House press secretary Dana Perino described the attackers as “deliberate, patient people who will murder innocents”, and said that the attack “underscores the reason we have to stay on the offense against the extremists in places like Kabul but also in other places around the world.”
SNT.51653.8344	The US Army Corps of Engineers decision to place restrictions on issuance of nationwide pollution permits has been upheld by a federal court.
SNT.51653.8345	In National Association of Home Builders v. Army Corps of Engineers, the District Court for the District of Columbia found that the Corps of Engineers had not acted in an "arbitrary" or "capricious" manner in changing the terms and conditions for issuance of a national pollution permit, including reducing the size of area into which pollutants may be discharged from 10 acres to 1 acre, raising the threshold for requiring additional permits from 1 acre to 1/10 acre,
SNT.51653.8346	A nationwide permit allows an organization to engage in certain industrial activities on a national basis (such as mining and construction), reducing the amount of paperwork and filings needed for otherwise minor environmental impacts, as opposed to an ordinary permit for a specific location which will engage in activities which generate water pollution.
SNT.51653.8347	Due to concerns over the amount of discharge taking place in waterways, the Corps of Engineers began in the 1980s to reduce the authority granted by nationwide permits and to bar use of the permits in certain ecologically sensitive areas.
SNT.51653.8348	Some industry groups, including the plaintiff in the above case, The National Association of Home Builders, sued the Corps of Engineers in 2000 over the change in an attempt to block its implementation.
SNT.51653.8349	Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, were given permission to intervene in the case in support of the actions of the Corps.
SNT.51653.8350	Environmental groups were pleased with the decision, but are concerned over other actions of the Bush Administration, such as the attempts to weaken provisions of the 2002 Clean Water Act to allow additional dumping of construction and mining waste into waterways as fill material.
SNT.100491.8351	The Iraqi government has demanded the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops, saying the five-day incursion is threatening their otherwise friendly relations.
SNT.100491.8352	Iraq's council of ministers says the Turkish military is violating Iraqi sovereignty by conducting the incursion into Kurdish areas of northern Iraq.
SNT.100491.8353	Ali al-Dabbagh, the spokesman for the Iraqi government, says the government rejects the unilateral Turkish incursion because it is a threat to their good neighborly relations.
SNT.100491.8354	The Turkish military crossed into Iraq to chase out Kurdish rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party.
SNT.100491.8355	The rebels want autonomy for Kurds in Turkey and have used bases inside Iraq to launch attacks on Turkish forces.
SNT.100491.8356	Al-Dabbagh acknowledged the threat posed to Turkey by the rebels and said the government stands ready for dialogue.
SNT.100491.8357	About 20 percent of Turkish citizens are Kurds and in the southeast, bordering Iraq, they make up the majority.
SNT.100491.8358	But Kurds in Turkey say their culture and language are oppressed.
SNT.100491.8359	Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, president of the Iraqi Parliament, says they have asked Turkey to resolve the situation peacefully.
SNT.100491.8360	He says the Turks should hold a referendum in south Turkey to give the Kurds the rights they want.
SNT.100491.8361	Iraq's Shiite parliament ministers issued a statement rejecting the Turkish military operation and supporting calls for their immediate withdrawal.
SNT.100491.8362	Elsewhere, a suicide bomber detonated in a bus near the northern city of Mosul, killing at least nine and wounding several others.
SNT.100491.8363	Meanwhile, millions of Shiites in Iraq gathered in the southern Iraqi city of Karbala for Arbaeen, a major Shiite commemoration.
SNT.100491.8364	Iraqi TV showed huge crowds of Shiites walking in procession, beating drums, and whipping and hitting themselves in ritual prostration.
SNT.100491.8365	More than 60 Shiite pilgrims were killed while making their way to Karbala this week, most of them from a Sunday suicide bombing.
SNT.24862.8366	On Monday, Google published on their blog that they are testing a new product named Google Base, in which users will be able to upload their own articles to a database.
SNT.24862.8367	This allegedly will complement the current services offered by Google.
SNT.24862.8368	Examples of contributions may include recipes, scientific findings, and other pieces of information one may wish to share.
SNT.24862.8369	Several news agencies are reporting that Google Base will be used for classified ads.
SNT.24862.8370	According to the Google Base website, which was made inaccessible to the public after a few hours, both were examples of entries you could post.
SNT.24862.8371	Google Base is expected to be a major competitor of craigslist, which is partly owned by eBay.
SNT.147615.8372	A massive earthquake, registering 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale, struck Haiti yesterday, destroying many buildings, disrupting communications, and burying an unknown number of people underneath rubble.
SNT.147615.8373	Thousands of people are feared to have been killed by the tremors, which were felt as far away as Venezuela.
SNT.147615.8374	Witnesses say bodies were lining the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, after the quake struck on Tuesday afternoon, sending a cloud of dust from falling buildings into the sky.
SNT.147615.8375	The quake was centered about sixteen kilometers from the capital, and struck at a depth of just ten kilometers, exacerbating the damage.
SNT.147615.8376	At least 27 aftershocks were also recorded, the strongest of which came in at 5.5 and 5.9 magnitude.
SNT.147615.8377	A tsunami alert was initially issued following the tremor, but it was retracted shortly afterwards.
SNT.147615.8378	Buildings across the capital have collapsed, including the presidential palace and the headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti.
SNT.147615.8379	However, the president, René Préval, and his wife reportedly survived the collapse of the building.
SNT.147615.8380	The country's envoy to the United States believed damage costs could reach billions of dollars.
SNT.147615.8381	UN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said many people were in the UN building when it went down and they remain unaccounted for.
SNT.147615.8382	A Brazilian military official later said four Brazilian soldiers who were part of the UN mission were killed.
SNT.147615.8383	The Notre Dame of the Assumption Cathedral in Port-au-Prince was also destroyed, killing Joseph Serge Miot, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince.
SNT.147615.8384	In a statement released yesterday, the UN remarked that "[f]or the moment, a large number of personnel remain unaccounted for."
SNT.261210.8385	India's has labelled honour killings a "slur on the nation," and warned the death penalty will await those found guilty of the crime.
SNT.261210.8386	An independent study says each year an estimated 900 people are murdered in India for bringing dishonour to their families, usually by falling in love and marrying outside their caste or within their sub-caste.
SNT.261210.8387	Honour killings, accepted as a cultural tradition in some parts of India, are normally punished with life imprisonment.
SNT.261210.8388	But Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Misra have now called for a tougher stance, directing courts throughout India to use capital punishment in their sentencing.
SNT.261210.8389	"It is time to stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on the nation.
SNT.261210.8390	This is necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous, uncivilised behaviour.
SNT.261210.8391	All persons who are planning to perpetrate honour killings should know that gallows await them," Justice Katju said.
SNT.261210.8392	The crack-down came yesterday, as the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal to lessen the life imprisonment of Bhagwan Dass.
SNT.261210.8393	The man strangled his married daughter to death with wire after discovering she was in an incestuous affair.
SNT.261210.8394	The Supreme Court also condemned the traditional village councils who endorse these honour killings and order them to be carried out.
SNT.18581.8395	A last minute deal reached Saturday dictates that about 1,000 Israeli settler greenhouses located in the Gaza strip will not be dismantled after Monday's pullout.
SNT.18581.8396	Instead, they will remain standing and be placed in Palestinian control.
SNT.18581.8397	The deal allows one of the Gaza strip's largest employers to remain intact.
SNT.18581.8398	Greenhouses in the region currently employ more than 4,000 people.
SNT.18581.8399	Mr. Wolfenson will purchase the greenhouses using funds amounting to US$14 million.
SNT.18581.8400	He will proceed to turn the properties over to Palestine.
SNT.18581.8401	Daniel Ayalon, Israeli ambassador to the United States, spoke optimistically of the greenhouse agreement.
SNT.18581.8402	Said Mr. Ayalon, "As we leave Gaza, and some parts of the West Bank, we are not leaving scorched earth.
SNT.18581.8403	On the contrary, we are leaving behind means for them to take over and immediately better their situation."
SNT.18581.8404	In Gaza, the median age is 15 and about 80% of the population live in poverty.
SNT.74315.8405	Iraq has defeated Australia 3-1 in their 2007 AFC Asian Cup Group A match at the Rajamangala Stadium, Bangkok, Thailand.
SNT.74315.8406	Iraq took the lead after twenty-three minutes when midfielder Nashat Akram scored.
SNT.74315.8407	He curled in a free kick from around thirty yards out, and Salih al Sadwn rushed towards Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer.
SNT.74315.8408	Al Sadwn's presence sufficiently distracted Schwarzer, who dived the wrong way.
SNT.74315.8409	Two minutes after the break, Australia equalised through striker Mark Viduka.
SNT.74315.8410	The Australian captain managed to head a curling cross by midfielder Brett Emerton back across Iraqi Noor Hassan's goal and into the top corner.
SNT.74315.8411	However, Iraq scored twice to win the match, the former through a defensive error by Australia.
SNT.74315.8412	Hawar Mulla Mohammed was played through with a lovely ball from a teammate, who had attracted the Australian central defence out-of-position.
SNT.74315.8413	Mohammed slotted the ball home from 15 yards to re-take the lead.
SNT.74315.8414	Iraq sealed the three Group A points when Karrar Jassim Mohammed scored in the eighty-sixth minute.
SNT.74315.8415	He managed to get on the end of a deflected shot and calmly tap the ball into an empty net, after goalkeeper Schwarzer had dived to defend the initial shot.
SNT.74315.8416	The win puts Iraq on equal-top of the group with hosts Thailand.
SNT.74315.8417	If Iraq defeats or draws with Oman in their final Group A encounter, they will progress through to the quarter-final stage.
SNT.74315.8418	Australia must defeat Thailand to remain any chance of progressing through to the next stage.
SNT.74315.8419	In the event that Australia win (ie. are on four points) and Iraq win or draw (ie. are on seven or five points), Australia will progress through to the next stage on head-to-head rather than Thailand despite having a possibly-worse goal difference.
SNT.74315.8420	Goal difference (goals for minus goals against) is only used to separate two teams if they drew in their head-to-head match in the group stage.
SNT.74315.8421	If Iraq lose to Oman and Australia win, all four teams will end up on four points.
SNT.74315.8422	It is unclear how the head-to-head rule will be applied by the AFC in this situation, and it is probable that goal difference will be used.
SNT.74315.8423	In Group B, Japan defeated United Arab Emirates 3-1 at the My Dinh National Stadium, Hanoi, Vietnam.
SNT.74315.8424	Defending champions Japan took the lead when Naohiro Takahara scored after twenty-two minutes.
SNT.74315.8425	Takahara doubled their advantage five minutes later when he sent a lovely volley into the right-hand side of the net after twenty-seven minutes, leaving Emirates goalkeeper Majed Maqdemi stranded.
SNT.74315.8426	Shunsuke Nakamura made it 3-0 before half time when he converted a penalty kick awarded to Japan on forty-two minutes.
SNT.74315.8427	The Emirates scored a goal after sixty-six minutes through Saeed Alkas, but no comeback eventuated and the final score was 3-1 top Japan.
SNT.74315.8428	It leaves Japan equal on top of the Group B table with Vietnam on two points, with the teams locked on four points each.
SNT.74315.8429	The winner of the match will take top spot in the group.
SNT.74315.8430	In the event that the Japan-Vietnam match is drawn, both teams have a goal difference of +2.
SNT.74315.8431	However, Japan have scored one more goal than Vietnam, and will take top spot in the group on that basis.
SNT.74315.8432	Qatar, the other team in Group B, must win against UAE and hope for a winner in the Japan-Vietnam match to progress, or else defeat the Emirates by three goals or more.
SNT.74315.8433	Qatar drew both matches with Japan and Vietnam, meaning it will come down to goal difference if two sides are equal on four points.
SNT.17530.8434	Ferrari's second driver, Rubens Barrichello, announced today that he will depart from Ferrari at the end of the season.
SNT.17530.8435	Barrichello was with the team since 2000, won nine Grand Prix, helping win five constructor titles.
SNT.17530.8436	Ferrari announced Felipe Massa, currently driving for Sauber, as Michael Schumacher's teammate for next season.
SNT.17530.8437	"I am aware of the responsibility it places on me and I cannot wait to be part of a team like Ferrari, alongside the best driver in the world, Michael Schumacher," said Massa.
SNT.17530.8438	Massa was Ferrari's test driver in 2003 season: "Now, I am in my third season as a Sauber driver and I can also count on a year's experience as a Ferrari test driver, an experience which helped me to grow a great deal."
SNT.43120.8439	Kenneth Thomson, Canada's richest man and the 9th wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes's 2005 ranking, died Monday morning at his office in Toronto.
SNT.43120.8440	The cause of death is reported to be a heart attack.
SNT.43120.8441	He was the former Thomson Corp. chairman and the company's controlling shareholder.
SNT.43120.8442	He made most of his money by making his father's trans-Atlantic newspaper (The Globe and Mail) into one of the world's leading resources for electronic information and data.
SNT.43120.8443	Mr. Thomson is survived by his wife, Marilyn; three sons, David, who succeeded him as chairman of Thomson in 2002, Peter and Taylor; and a sister, Audrey Campbell.
SNT.43120.8444	A memorial service will be held on a date that has yet to be announced.
SNT.109914.8445	Documents leaked on Wikileaks and seen by Wikinews have revealed that Cuba signed a confidential deal with Venezuela to ensure that Cuba gets access to a high speed internet connection by 2010.
SNT.109914.8446	The document stated, in Spanish, that the countries aim to "build and operate a line of fiber optic cables between Venezuela and Cuba."
SNT.109914.8447	Julian Assange, an investigative editor on Wikileaks, claimed that the information in the documents "adds weight to Cuban statements that the United States economic embargo of the island has forced it to rely on slow and expensive satellite links for Internet connectivity."
SNT.109914.8448	The document then says that cable will "extend between two terminals located at the coast of both countries."
SNT.109914.8449	Information week has reported that the cable is expected to cost several million US dollars.
SNT.109914.8450	They base this on a fact that a cable between Cuba and Florida, which is a much shorter distance than between Cuba and Venezuela, would cost half a million dollars.
SNT.109914.8451	The US government has prevented the building of the Florida cable.
SNT.82404.8452	"Normal" in the 2007 Ironman Triathlon World Championship was only the fact the sun rose in the east, as shortly past the swim start the day brought forth a hot and cloudless Hawaiian sky; injuries and illnesses to many; DNFs for two years worth of defending champions; and a first-time winner.
SNT.82404.8453	Australian Chris McCormack, placing 2nd in 2006, passed Aussie Craig Alexander in the marathon and further scorched the Queen Kaahumanu Kaʻahumanu Highway with a 2:42:02 run to claim the world title in 8:15:34.
SNT.82404.8454	In even more excitement, rookie (her first Ironman length race was seven weeks ago in Korea) Chrissie Wellington, from Great Britain, claimed the women's title finished in 9:08:45.
SNT.82404.8455	The 6:45 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time start to the 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile time-trial, and a 26.2 mile marathon saw a cascade of unfortunates to favorites.
SNT.82404.8456	Defending 2006 champions Normann Stadler and Michellie Jones and 2005 champion Faris Al-Sultan were struck down with stomach ailments; six-time winner and 2005 champion Natascha Badmann totaled her bike after crashing into road cone; and Luke Bell was sidelined with a leg injury.
SNT.82404.8457	But a sense of "normal" returned later in the day as the temperature and winds rose and as many of the 1,788 starters completed before the October 14, 2007 12:00am deadline.
SNT.149903.8458	The Iraq Inquiry in London has revealed that United Kingdom justice secretary Jack Straw ignored the advice of Sir Michael Wood, the Foreign Office's most senior legal adviser until his resignation in 2006, that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was illegal under international law.
SNT.149903.8459	This is the first time that Wood has publicly expressed an opinion on the war.
SNT.149903.8460	Wood advised Straw, then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, that invading Iraq without the backing of the United Nations Security Council in the form of a specific mandate—which the resolution the government used to support the war lacked—would "amount to the crime of aggression", to which Straw responded that he was being "dogmatic and international law was pretty vague".
SNT.149903.8461	Wood disputes this, saying, "Obviously there are some areas of international law that can be quite uncertain.
SNT.149903.8462	This, however, turned exclusively on the interpretation of a specific text and it is one on which I think that international law was pretty clear."
SNT.149903.8463	He says that it was unprecedented for the government to ignore his advice, and told the inquiry that he "considered that the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law," since the Security Council had not met to approve the use of force, nor to agree that Iraq was committing a "material breach" of existing disarmament resolutions.
SNT.149903.8464	He believed that regime change was the reason for the British interest in the nation, and that it was not a valid reason for war.
SNT.149903.8465	He told the inquiry, "I made it clear that, in my view, the draft that they were working toward did not authorize the use of force without a further decision of the Security Council".
SNT.149903.8466	Recently declassified letters prove that Wood raised these concerns directly with Jack Straw.
SNT.149903.8467	In one of these letters, dated January 24, 2003, Wood said that the "UK cannot lawfully use force in Iraq in ensuring compliance" with UN resolutions (including resolution 1441, which gave Saddam Hussein a "final opportunity" to comply with the UN's mandates on weapons of mass destruction by November 2002).
SNT.149903.8468	In his reply, Straw "noted", but "did not accept" Wood's advice.
SNT.149903.8469	Straw said he was "as committed as anyone to international law and its obligations".
SNT.149903.8470	In this case, the issue is an arguable one, capable of honestly and reasonably held differences of view."
SNT.149903.8471	He said he wanted a new UN resolution "for political reasons", but said that there was a "strong case" that existing resolutions would "provide a sufficient basis in international law to justify military action".
SNT.149903.8472	Instead of following Wood's advice, government ministers used the advice of Lord Goldsmith, who was then the Attorney General for England and Wales.
SNT.149903.8473	Goldsmith—who is scheduled to appear before the Inquiry this Wednesday—advised Straw that a second UN resolution would not be required to invade, based on a series of UN resolutions reaching back to the end of the Gulf War, despite having told the prime minister—only then days before—to wait for another UN resolution, the passing of which they had pushed other Security Council members for in the weeks running up to the invasion.
SNT.149903.8474	Wood makes it clear, however, that the final decision regarding the legality of war lay with the Attorney General, rather than with himself.
SNT.149903.8475	The inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, was told that there were concerns about how the decision was made among the Foreign Office's senior legal advisors.
SNT.149903.8476	Elizabeth Wilmshurst, then Deputy Legal Adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, resigned in protest only days before the invasion.
SNT.149903.8477	She criticised the decision-making process for its lack of transparency, and called it "lamentable".
SNT.149903.8478	She also called the fact that Goldsmith gave his opinion only days before the invasion "extraordinary".
SNT.149903.8479	Wood said that Straw had "often been advised things were unlawful and gone ahead anyway and won in the courts" when he was home secretary.
SNT.149903.8480	Last week, Straw—when questioned by the inquiry—called the decision to support the war a "profoundly difficult political and moral dilemma", and said it was the "most difficult" decision of his entire career.
SNT.149903.8481	Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey called Wood's statement "the final nail in the coffin of the case for a legal war."
SNT.149903.8482	He asks if the advice reached then prime minister Tony Blair or Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, "And if not, why not?"
SNT.149903.8483	Wood's statement is expected to cause problems for Tony Blair when he appears before the inquiry on Friday.
SNT.149903.8484	The war has provoked protests, and much outrage among politicians who believe that Blair was wrong to support then United States President George W. Bush by sending 45,000 British soldiers—179 of whom died in combat—to fight in Iraq.
SNT.149903.8485	The Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, is due to appear before the inquiry on Friday, and Gordon Brown, the current prime minister, is scheduled before the general election (which is expected to occur in May).
SNT.149903.8486	Brown said yesterday that he "think[s] the mistake in the war was not to do the reconstruction and plan it in the way that was necessary so that Iraq could recover quickly after Saddam Hussein fell," and is expected to come under fire from the inquiry, which he himself set up, for his role in the war.
SNT.127713.8487	]After holding an emergency meeting, the World Health Organisation (WHO) officially declared a worldwide swine flu pandemic on Thursday.
SNT.127713.8488	The agency increased its pandemic alert level to the sixth level, its highest.
SNT.127713.8489	"On the basis of available evidence, and these expert assessments of the evidence, the scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met.
SNT.127713.8490	I have therefore decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to phase 6," said the the WHO's director Margaret Chan in a press conference earlier today.
SNT.127713.8491	According to Reuters, Chan earlier sent out a letter to WHO staff saying, "With today's announcement, WHO moves from an emergency to a longer-term response.
SNT.127713.8492	Based on past experience, this pandemic will be with us for some months, if not years, to come."
SNT.127713.8493	Chan, however, stressed the move does not indicate that the influenza has become more deadly or severe.
SNT.127713.8494	"Moving to pandemic phase six does not imply we will see increases in deaths or serious cases," she said.
SNT.127713.8495	The WHO says that many of the severe cases of the virus are reported in people with prior chronic illnesses.
SNT.127713.8496	Of those infected, the WHO says the majority are aged from 30 to 50 years old.
SNT.127713.8497	Currently, the WHO's official tally says there were almost thirty thousand confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus so far, with about 141 fatalities from the disease.
SNT.59591.8498	Scientists have uncovered the largest Neolithic settlement in the United Kingdom at the Durrington Walls and believe that the village was inhabited by the people who built the Stonehenge monument.
SNT.59591.8499	Scientists say that the village was built around 2,600 B.C., roughly when Stonehenge was believed to have been constructed, and housed over 100 people.
SNT.59591.8500	Inside the areas which would have been the interior of houses at the time, scientists also found outlines of what they think were beds and cupboards or dressers.
SNT.59591.8501	Animal bones, arrowheads, stone tools and other relics were also discovered.
SNT.59591.8502	"We've never seen such quantities of pottery and animal bone and flint.
SNT.59591.8503	In what were houses, we have excavated the outlines on the floors of box beds and wooden dressers or cupboards," said Sheffield University archaeologist, Mike Parker Pearson.
SNT.59591.8504	So far, the dig has revealed at least 8 houses roughly 14-16 feet square, but scientists say that they think there may have been at least 25 altogether.
SNT.59591.8505	The site was likely to have been occupied only seasonally rather than year-round and evidence suggests that a lot of "partying" went on at the location.
SNT.59591.8506	This is where they went to party - you could say it was the first free festival.
SNT.59591.8507	There's a lack of craft-working equipment for cleaning animal hides and no evidence for crop-processing," added Pearson.
SNT.59591.8508	The Durrington Walls are approximately 2 miles from the Stonehenge site.
SNT.204464.8509	In a speech in Wisconsin, US President Barack Obama announced a USD50 billion plan to restore 150,000 miles of roads, lay 4,000 miles of railroad tracks and rebuild 150 miles of airport runways within six years.
SNT.204464.8510	The speech was given at an annual Labor Day festival in Milwaukee to union workers on Monday afternoon.
SNT.204464.8511	"All of this will not only create jobs immediately, it's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul," Obama said during the speech.
SNT.204464.8512	The president also said that "we are going to rebuild 150,000 miles of our roads — that's enough to circle the world six times...
SNT.204464.8513	We're going to lay and maintain 4,000 miles of our railways — enough to stretch coast-to-coast" and that he was "going to keep fighting, every single day, every single hour, every single minute to turn this economy around".
SNT.204464.8514	Most of the new railways that Obama talked about will be high-speed rail lines, and the president also said that his administration would "restore 150 miles of runways and advance a next-generation air traffic control system to reduce travel time and delays for American travelers — something I think folks across the political spectrum could agree on."
SNT.204464.8515	In the Obama Administration's plan, a new infrastructure bank will be created.
SNT.204464.8516	Obama stressed that the new bill will not add to the federal budget deficit, with Obama saying that "this is a plan that will be fully paid for.
SNT.204464.8517	It will not add to the deficit over time — we're going to work with Congress to see to that."
SNT.204464.8518	An Obama administration official also said that the plan will be funded by closing tax loopholes for oil and gas corporations.
SNT.204464.8519	Though Obama said that "these are projects and efforts that have bipartisan support that we know could possibly get support in the Congress and the Senate", Republicans expressed reservations about the new plan, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell calling it "a last-minute, cobbled-together stimulus bill".
SNT.23751.8520	Numerous smuggled artifacts were found at an Austrian tour guide's home.
SNT.23751.8521	Five Italians were arrested and twenty-eight others are now being investigated.
SNT.23751.8522	The Austrian, known as "Mozart" in the art trafficking world, received a citation for his involvement.
SNT.23751.8523	Police claim that some 600 artifacts, which had been illegally excavated, were found.
SNT.23751.8524	Most ranged from 8th century BCE to the 5th century CE.
SNT.23751.8525	Many of the items were gold and silver, along with ceramics.
SNT.23751.8526	One item, a cup, has been valued at several thousand Euros.
SNT.23751.8527	The artifacts were plundered from an archaeological site near Rome by "Mozart" using his tour guide credentials.
SNT.23751.8528	Italian authorities expect that the plundered artifacts will finally be displayed in Italian museums.
SNT.5008.8529	A compound in the common daisy-like plant feverfew kills human leukemia stem cells and could form the basis for newer, more effective drugs for the disease.
SNT.5008.8530	American researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York say that it could take months to develop a useable drug from the compound, parthenolide.
SNT.5008.8531	However, they are working to do so with chemists at the University of Kentucky who have identified a water-soluble molecule with the same properties.
SNT.5008.8532	The US National Cancer Institute has also accepted the work into its rapid access program, which aims to speed experimental drugs into human clinical trials.
SNT.5008.8533	"This research is a very important step in setting the stage for future development of a new therapy for leukemia," says Rochester researcher Craig Jordan.
SNT.5008.8534	"We have proof that we can kill leukemia stem cells with this type of agent, and that is good news."
SNT.5008.8535	Parthenolide appears to target the roots of myeloid leukemia, stem cells, while current treatments including the relatively new drug Gleevec don't.
SNT.5008.8536	So, "You're pulling the weed without getting to the root," says Jordan.
SNT.5008.8537	Used for centuries to fight fevers, inflammation and arthritis, feverfew earned interest from the Rochester researchers after other scientists showed that it could prevent skin cancer in animal models.
SNT.5008.8538	So the researchers investigated how a concentrated form of the plant component parthenolide would affect leukemia cells and normal cells.
SNT.5008.8539	Comparing the impact of parthenolide to the common chemotherapy drug cytarabine, they found that parthenolide selectively killed leukemia cells while sparing normal cells better.
SNT.5008.8540	While the findings suggest that parthenolide is a good starting point for new drugs, people with leukemia aren't being encouraged to take high doses of feverfew as they could not take enough of the remedy to halt the disease.
SNT.111294.8541	On Monday, Russian troops advanced roughly 25 miles into Georgia.
SNT.111294.8542	The Interior Ministry of Georgia said that Russian units had moved from the self-declared republic of Abkhazia, to the town of Senaki, within Georgian territory.
SNT.111294.8543	The Russian Defence department has stated that the push into Georgian territory was necessary because of the continued attacks by the Georgian troops in South Ossetia.
SNT.111294.8544	A spokesman from the Georgian Interior ministry said that Russian units had also taken control of the town of Zugdidi.
SNT.111294.8545	Dmitry Medvedev, the President of Russia, stated that "the enforced detention of Russian citizens in Georgia is an unacceptable situation and in complete violation of international law," according to a press release published by the Russia Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
SNT.111294.8546	On August 11th, the Russian Defence Ministry announced that troops are leaving the military base in Senaki, and preparing to head back to Abkhazia.
SNT.111294.8547	Georgian sources confirmed the announcement, stating that the base had been destroyed.
SNT.111294.8548	According to Russian officials, Russia has no intention of occupying territory beyond South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
SNT.111294.8549	Both the town of Senaki and Zugdidi lie in Georgia proper, outside the "security zone" around the region of Abkhazia.
SNT.111294.8550	The border has been maintained by Russian forces since the 1990s.
SNT.111294.8551	There has been increasing pressure by foreign powers for a ceasefire in the South Ossetian conflict.
SNT.111294.8552	Mikhail Saakashvili, the President of Georgia signed a European Union supported ceasefire, but it was not accepted by Russia.
SNT.111294.8553	According to Reuters, Georgian troops did not observe the cease fire, since six helicopters bombed Tskhinvali on August 11.
SNT.111294.8554	The crisis broke out after days of fighting between Georgian forces and Ossetian separatist units.
SNT.111294.8555	On August 7, Georgian troops launched an offensive against Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia region.
SNT.111294.8556	The next day Russian forces entered the territory of Georgia and bombed several targets in the country.
SNT.111294.8557	On August 10th, Russian Black Sea Fleet began a naval blockade of Georgian port of Poti and landed several thousand Russian troops in Abkhazia in western Georgia.
SNT.111294.8558	Ukraine threatened to bar Russian warships dispatched to the Abkhazian coast from returning to their Ukrainian base of Sevastopol if they engage in any military action.
SNT.104236.8559	Robert Mugabe, president of the Republic of Zimbabwe bitterly slated opposition and the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler, in a speech he made earlier today.
SNT.104236.8560	This is his first speech after the recent disputed elections in which Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won the parliamentary voting.
SNT.104236.8561	However announcement of an overall victory for the MDC has come to a standstill as results from 23 out of the 210 constituencies are still being recounted.
SNT.104236.8562	Mr. Mugabe asked his 15,000 strong audience to "maintain utmost vigilance in the face of vicious British machinations and the machinations of our other detractors, who are allies of Britain" while speaking at the Gwanzura Stadium in Zimbabwe's capital city of Harare.
SNT.104236.8563	The audience wore shirts adorned with Mugabe portraits and waved banners reading "Defending our land from imperialists" and "Zimbabwe has no place for sell-outs" in support of Zanu-PF policies.
SNT.104236.8564	"Down with the British" was chanted, Mr. Mugabe saying the British are "like thieves fronting their lackeys among us, which they pay to confuse our people".
SNT.104236.8565	"We, not the British, established democracy based on one person, one vote - democracy which rejected racial or gender discrimination and upheld human rights and religious freedom," he said in response to the international criticism he has lately received, especially from Gordon Brown.
SNT.104236.8566	The speech was made in a celebration of 28 years since the day of Zimbabwean independence, which Mr. Mugabe called the day on which his nation "finally shook off the chains of British racist settler colonialism".

SNT.72886.8578	The anonymous individual responsible for suggesting, 14 hours before police discovered the body, that WWE wrestler Chris Benoit's wife was dead is saying his/her comment was a "terrible coincidence."
SNT.72886.8579	In a post made at 12:26 AM EDT Friday morning to the talk page of a Wikinews article headlined as the "Death of Nancy Benoit rumour posted on Wikipedia hours prior to body being found", the user admitted to writing that Nancy Benoit was dead at the Wikipedia article page for Benoit came from information that was garnered from "rumors and speculation online."
SNT.72886.8580	The IP Address of the individual making the apology was identical to that of the one who posted the Nancy Benoit rumor, a strong confirmation of the admission's authenticity.
SNT.72886.8581	The lengthy apology was not signed, with the individual claiming, "I am just an everyday individual who posted a wrongful remark at the time that received so much attention because it turned out to actually happen."
SNT.72886.8582	Wikinews originally broke the story about the suspicious edit after receiving a tip from Wikipedia administrators.
SNT.72886.8583	The fact the edit originated from a computer in Stamford, Connecticut (the site of WWE headquarters) appears to be another coincidence.
SNT.72886.8584	The anonymous editor left a lengthy apology to the Wikimedia community, explaining, "I hope this puts an end to this speculation that someone knew about the tragedy before it was discovered."
SNT.72886.8585	Wikinews is continuing to follow the story, but the anonymous user has declined an interview.
SNT.112124.8586	Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich’s office announced layoffs of up to 450 state employees and the closure of 25 historic sites and state parks.
SNT.112124.8587	Fourteen state historic sites are scheduled to be closed October 1.
SNT.112124.8588	A spokesperson for the governor stated that the office had no choice but to make the budget cuts because of a faltering economy and an unbalanced state budget.
SNT.112124.8589	Included in the cuts were the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), which operates the state parks, the Department of Children and Family Services (IDCFS), slated to have 179 employees cut, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA) and the Department of Human Services, which is expected to lose 79 positions.
SNT.112124.8590	The IHPA, which operates the state historic sites slated for closure will cut some 38 positions.
SNT.112124.8591	The closures and job cuts will save the state money over the next fiscal year.
SNT.112124.8592	Cuts in the IDNR will save an estimated US$19.5 million and cuts at the IDCFS will save around US$2 million.
SNT.112124.8593	The closures are considered indefinite but will last at least through the end of the fiscal year, July 1, 2009.
SNT.112124.8594	Each site will have one employee on site for security and maintenance.

SNT.397139.8601	Roxana Velásquez, SDMA executive director, described their bequeathed collection's "rarity" and said the pieces would add "depth" to the two existing museum collections.
SNT.397139.8602	The collection will be separated between the two museums due to the art movements represented within it.
SNT.397139.8603	The Museum of Contemporary Art will receive 30 contemporary works by artists such as Franz Kline, Christo, and Craig Kauffman.
SNT.397139.8604	The Museum of Art was bequeathed 48 German Expressionist paintings, drawings and prints.

SNT.47013.8624	With wind speeds of 216 km/h (135 mph) at the time of landfall it is the strongest typhoon to hit China since August 1, 1956, when a storm with wind speeds of 244 km/h killed 4,900 people.
SNT.47013.8625	Emergency plans have been implemented and supplies are being sent in from other provinces.
SNT.47013.8626	The central government has allocated 166 million yuan to assist the affected region.
SNT.118238.8627	At least 28 people drowned and were confirmed dead, 46 were rescued, while 34 others remain missing on Sunday, after an overcrowded passenger motorboat capsized off waters in Ballesteros, a town of 17,000 people, the Cagayan police reported.
SNT.118238.8628	M/B Mae Jan', a wooden-hulled ferry, was carrying 102 passengers, after an eight-hour voyage from Calayan Island in the Luzon Strait for Appari when it capsized less than 300 meters (984 feet) from its destination, at 8:30 p.m.
SNT.118238.8629	Divers from the combined teams of the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard helped in the rescue operations.
SNT.118238.8630	11 of the fatalities, including the vessel owner, Arellano, and her daughter were identified.
SNT.118238.8631	The police said "there was a possibility that the boat was overloaded," saying that "there was also livestock on board."
SNT.118238.8632	Due to "trauma," the ferry's captain refused to talk to police.
SNT.118238.8633	Meanwhile, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) formed a Special Board of Marine Inquiry (SBMI) to investigate the sea tragedy.
SNT.118238.8634	It ordered the "immediate dispatch of SAR-003 and MCS-3005 vessels and the PCG Islander for aerial surveillance."
SNT.118238.8635	PCG noted the possible overloading of the vessel since the boat's franchise authorized it to carry only 40 passengers and 10 crew members.
SNT.118238.8636	In November, a cargo vessel sank in rough seas north of Cagayan, and passing vessels rescued 16 of 20 passengers.
SNT.118238.8637	Weeks earlier, separate storms sank two passenger vessels in the central Philippines, drowning more than 50 people.
SNT.118238.8638	Prior to the ferry sinking, the Philippine weather bureau had issued Gale warnings to coastal towns, of approaching tropical storm "Ulysses" (international codename: Dolphin) from the Pacific with winds of up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour, centered off southeastern Catanduanes, eastern Philippines.
SNT.60500.8639	During a press conference yesterday, United States military and intelligence officials presented material they say link weapons used by Iraq fighters to Iran.
SNT.60500.8640	Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Madrid on Friday that the there was "pretty good" evidence that Iranians are supplying either weapons or technology to Iraqi militants.
SNT.60500.8641	No recording devices of any kind were allowed during the press conference.
SNT.60500.8642	Reacting to the U.S. claims, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a television interview that the allegations were "excuses to prolong the stay" of the U.S. military in Iraq, and that the U.S. was pointing fingers at others in an effort to "hide its defeats and failures"; however in an interview with Diane Sawyer on February 12th, Ahmadinejad refused to address accusations that his country was supplying weapons to insurgents in Iraq.
SNT.60500.8643	Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hossein termed the accusations baseless propaganda and said that the U.S. had a long history of "fabricating evidence".
SNT.60500.8644	American officials displayed weaponry including Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) and thermal detectors used for remotely exploding bombs.
SNT.60500.8645	Some of the weapons parts bear the markings that the officials associated with Iranian manufacture.
SNT.60500.8646	The officials claimed that such sophisticated weaponry could not have been assembled by the Shia militia and said that it must have been supplied from neighbouring Iran.
SNT.60500.8647	The U.S. view is that only a state arms company would have the ability to manufacture weapons of this kind and the officials maintained that the weapons were smuggled in to Iraq by the Qods Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and have estimated that such an operation was known to the Iranian government and encouraged by it, but did not present any evidence to support the claims.
SNT.60500.8648	The U.S. evidence is being met with close scrutiny, after the experience of pre-Iraq war U.S. intelligence estimates of Saddam Hussein's weapons capability and links with Al-Qaeda, which were found to be inaccurate.
SNT.60500.8649	When asked why this information was being released at this specific moment, even though the information had accumulated since 2004, the officials explained that they saw a near doubling of EFP attacks in 2006.

SNT.194115.8689	The sailors had been captured in the Niger Delta from their vessel, the BBC Polonia, apparently by one of the numerous armed militant groups in the area, although no one has yet claimed responsibility.
SNT.194115.8690	One such group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, said that it was "not involved in this attack but we are aware of the group that carried out the abduction."

SNT.194115.8692	In addition, one Latvian sailor had been a member of the crew of the ship, but was not taken hostage after he was injured in the incident.
SNT.194115.8693	A spokesperson for the Nigerian Navy, David Nabaida, said that the navy have gone to meet the fishing trawler the men were released onto.
SNT.194115.8694	"I don't know who is behind [the attack], but I think it's one of the factions of the ex-militants," he said.
SNT.194115.8695	Kidnappings such as this are common in the Niger Delta area, with most being for ransom.
SNT.194115.8696	The region is the site of the largest oil-producing industries on the continent, and has a high rate of crime.
SNT.116697.8697	In a reprise of the dour Presbyterian Minister character the Reverend I.M. Jolly, created by the late comedian Rikki Fulton, Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, took part in the BBC's annual charity appeal for Children in Need.
SNT.116697.8698	Last year the BBC's appeal raised approximately £37 million, and by 11pm last night the total raised had exceeded £10 million.
SNT.116697.8699	The BBC hopes to break last year's telethon total and final figures will not be available for some time.
SNT.116697.8700	The three minute skit was part of BBC Scotland's presentation of the charity appeal and was met with laughter from the Glasgow studio audience when the pre-recorded message was broadcast.
SNT.116697.8701	The I.M. Jolly character was well-known in Scotland from having a spot on the Hogmanay (New Year's eve) schedule; in keeping with Fulton's terminally depressed character Salmond opened with the catchprase, "Hullo.
SNT.116697.8702	The sketch gave Salmond an opportunity to be self-deprecating as well as poke fun at his predecessor in the office of First Minister, Jack McConnell, "I would like to pay tribute to the previous incumbent of the first ministership, the Right Reverend Jack McConnell.
SNT.116697.8703	And I would also like to thank him for the present of fish he left me in Bute House ...under the floorboards."
SNT.116697.8704	As a further jab at McDonald he joked that he and his wife "had a great time too, replacing all the light bulbs he had taken with him."
SNT.116697.8705	In reference to the fortunes of his party, the SNP, Salmond described by-election campaigns in Glasgow East and Glenrothes as "evangelical crusades" which, "had gone down well in Glasgow East - but "slightly less well in Glenrothes".
SNT.116697.8706	Closing the "Last Call" segment he appealed for donations, "Please dig deep - it's for the weans."
SNT.9705.8707	The U.S. military reports 75 militants dead in an offensive launched Sunday in western Iraq.
SNT.9705.8708	The offensive was begun with U.S. air support in a desert area north of the Euphrates River in the province of Anbar.
SNT.9705.8709	A report by a Chicago Tribune journalist embedded with U.S. forces said the offensive "was seeking to uproot a persistent insurgency in an area that American intelligence indicated has become a haven for foreign fighters flowing in from Syria."
SNT.9705.8710	More than 1,000 U.S. and coalition troops supported by fighter jets and helicopter gunships attacked villages in and around Al Qaim, near the Syrian border.
SNT.9705.8711	A statement by the US military said the operation was expected to last several days, and was targeting a smuggling route and hideouts for foreign rebels.
SNT.9705.8712	The American Forces Press Service reports: "Coalition forces also destroyed car bombs, bomb-making material and two buildings that contained large weapons caches to include hand- and rocket-propelled grenades."

SNT.9705.8714	Col. Bob Chase, the chief of operations for the Second Marine Division, has said there were "a handful" of marine casualties.
SNT.9705.8715	The source also reports Chase saying, "The objective is to totally disrupt the safe havens and rat lines that have allowed them to bring those materials across the border.
SNT.9705.8716	This had been a very secure area for the insurgents."
SNT.9705.8717	In a statement made from an Islamist website that could not be confirmed, the Al-Qaeda militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi reportedly said, "The adorers of the cross claim to have killed 75 Muslims at Al-Qaim.

SNT.6482.8719	In a land of four million people where roughly one fourth of the population faces danger of hunger, opposition party supporters are receiving a harsh message from government run emergency food stations in the run up to Thursday's election: Vote for Mugabe, or starve.
SNT.6482.8720	As two British newspapers reported four days before general elections, Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe is using food as a political weapon in a country dominated by scarcity.
SNT.6482.8721	The government food distribution agency is the only source for something to eat for vast numbers of Zimbabweans today.
SNT.6482.8722	Determined to destroy opposition parties, Mugabe and his supporters seek to prevent anyone who supports the opposition from receiving rations.

SNT.232740.8726	A nearby "militant compound" was also destroyed by the missiles.
SNT.232740.8727	"Three militants were killed in the car while four were killed in the house," the official said.
SNT.232740.8728	The second attack occurred within minutes of the first, and four militants, who were carrying on rescue work were killed by the two missiles that had been fired.
SNT.232740.8729	Intelligence officials believe that the militants were associated with Hafiz Gul Bahadur.
SNT.232740.8730	"We are trying to establish identity of the militants but most of them are believed to be fighters of Hafiz Gul Bahadur," an official told the media.
SNT.232740.8731	However, the death toll and the identity of those killed was not officially confirmed.
SNT.232740.8732	A local official stated that they had heard reports stating "that four foreigners were also killed in these fresh attacks".
SNT.232740.8733	However, he added that their identity is "still not known" and mentioned that they "are collecting more information."
SNT.120202.8734	Workers at British industrial plants are staging mass walkouts this morning.
SNT.120202.8735	The workers are taking unofficial action in support of a three day strike at Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire, England.
SNT.120202.8736	Staff have walked out at sites in Scotland, Wales and Teesside in north eastern England.
SNT.120202.8737	The original strike was called over the awarding of a contract by refinery owners Total to an Italian company.
SNT.120202.8738	This brought 300 Italian and Portuguese workers on to the site.
SNT.120202.8739	The latest reports say workers at the UK's main oil refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland have come out in sympathy, as have workers at the former ICI plant on Teesside in England and at the nearby Corus steel plant.
SNT.120202.8740	Workers have walked out at a power station in Aberthaw in south Wales and at plants at Fidler's Ferry in Cheshire, at Lackenby in Teesside and at the gas terminals near Peterhead in Scotland and Milford Haven in Wales.
SNT.120202.8741	A protest outside the Lindsey refinery has now dispersed but local union leaders say it will resume on Monday.
SNT.120202.8742	Secondary industrial action has been illegal in the United Kingdom since the 1980s.
SNT.120202.8743	However, the penalties apply only to unions organising secondary strikes, not to workers acting individually.
SNT.78052.8744	Announced early Wednesday morning at Nokia's GoEvent, in a plan to expand the company's revenue, Finland-based company Nokia Inc. is developing a mobile phone similar to its rival iPhone, which will be available in the near future for Nokia customers.
SNT.78052.8745	Most of the features are the same as the iPhone's.
SNT.78052.8746	They include music, games, and many other features, even ones that the iPhone may not have.
SNT.78052.8747	Ovi (in Finnish meaning "Door") will be the door for more than 2 million songs and games available for download on the new device.
SNT.78052.8748	Users will be able to download wirelessly in their own home or anywhere there is access to a computer.
SNT.78052.8749	But this is not the first time Nokia has made an attempt like this to increase its revenue.
SNT.78052.8750	In October of 2003 the company revealed the N-Gage, a game-playing cell phone, but was "stocked-out" due to poor sales.
SNT.78052.8751	The N95 smartphone, which was released in the U.S. on April 7, 2007 (before the iPhone on June 29, 2007) includes WiFi, a GPS, a music player, and a 5 megapixel digital camera.
SNT.78052.8752	The three other phones that were revealed at the event in London will be in-stock next quarter.
SNT.78052.8753	The new N81 and the modified N95 smartphones were among the revealed at yesterday's event; the N81 is a new member to Nokia's smartphone family; the N95 has been modified by having more memory and a sleeker LCD screen.
SNT.78052.8754	When Nokia was asked about the striking similarity between this and the iPhone, Nokia's Executive Vice President and General Manager of Multimedia, Anssi Vanjoki, said, "If there is something good in the world then we copy with pride."
SNT.78052.8755	During their demo they omitted the fact that the demo was for the software to be in use, not the actual hardware.
SNT.63098.8756	When Wouter Van Bellingen became the first black registrar in Belgium, he knew there would be negative reactions, but he admitted that he didn't expect them to be "so direct, so soon."
SNT.63098.8757	In February, three couples refused to pledge their wedding vows in front of the first black alderman of the city of Sint-Niklaas, because of the colour of his skin.
SNT.63098.8758	After the racist incident, Van Bellingen told himself: "If people don't want to marry, then that's not my problem, it's the problem of those people."
SNT.63098.8759	But then someone gave him the idea to react with a positive signal against racial discrimination.
SNT.63098.8760	Together with local NGOs and the Center for Equal Opportunities and against Racial Discrimination, he decided to organise a multicultural group marriage happening to, as mayor of Sint-Niklaas Freddy Willockx describes it, "forge this stupid racist behaviour into an unparallelled positive signal against racism and for tolerance."
SNT.5942.8761	Wikipedia hit the half-million mark Friday as the English-language encyclopedia passed the 500 thousand article mark, according to a press prelease by the Wikimedia Foundation (The Wikimedia Foundation also runs Wikinews).
SNT.5942.8762	The article that put the site over the top was Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union.
SNT.5942.8763	The total of 500 thousand articles exceeds any other encyclopedia, according to the press release.
SNT.5942.8764	With an average of 2,500 characters per article, Wikipedia contains 1.25 gigabytes of raw text, which if printed on double-sided letter-size paper would form a stack about 66 feet or more than six stories tall.
SNT.5942.8765	Other recent additions to its English-language edition include hundreds of full-length songs, almost a gigabyte of new images, and subject-specific portals.
SNT.32490.8766	In response to recent accusations that United States government employees have engaged in Wikipedia vandalism and other forms of perceived negative editing of articles, Wikipedia editors have set up a webpage listing all Wikipedia edits made through IP addresses that are allocated to the United States House of Representatives and other United States government agencies.
SNT.32490.8767	The House IP address was briefly banned from editing Wikipedia articles in the wake of the initial controversy, but the ban was lifted on January 30 after Wikipedia administrators decided that there have been a number of valuable contributions made through the House and Senate IP addresses in addition to the controversial edits.
SNT.32490.8768	On January 31 and February 1, however, the U.S. House of Representatives' common IP address, 143.231.249.141, were banned again for three hours due to vandalism.
SNT.32490.8769	Because the IP address is shared by House staff members, it is uncertain whether or not the same person(s) responsible for the previous vandalism are also responsible for the latest.
SNT.32490.8770	After the block from Wikipedia expired, the House of Representatives user continued to edit the article on Chris Shays.
SNT.32490.8771	Chris Shays had co-sponsored a bill with Marty Meehan, whose staffers had previously been found to have been negatively editing Wikipedia entries, The American Civil Liberties Union said of the bill "key elements of Shays-Meehan violate the First Amendment right to free speech because the legislation contains provisions that would violate the constitutionally-protected right of the people to express their opinions about issues through broadcast advertising if they mention the name of a candidate."
SNT.32490.8772	All mentions of the bill were removed from the article.
SNT.32490.8773	Also removed was a paragraph about Chris Shays raising $70,000 with House Speaker Dennis Hastert at a country club event.
SNT.32490.8774	Again, the IP address was blocked for an eight-hour period.
SNT.32490.8775	Wikipedia edits in Congress are not coming from the House of Representatives alone.
SNT.32490.8776	An edit from the Senate in July removed references to a plagiarism scandal with Senator Joe Biden, who has informally said he may seek a Democratic nomination for president in 2008.
SNT.32490.8777	As of February 4, 2006, the edit has not been fixed by Wikipedia users.

SNT.102155.8781	The Central Tibetan Administration, headed by the Dalai Lama, says that at least 80 people have been killed in protests by supporters of Tibet against Chinese rule, despite China's claim that only ten people are dead.
SNT.102155.8782	"As the Tibet uprising continues, reliable sources have confirmed that at least 80 people were killed on 14th March 2008 in Lhasa," the website Tibet.net reported.
SNT.102155.8783	They also said that many dead bodies have been stashed in front of a Public Security Department office in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital where most of the unrest occurred.
SNT.102155.8784	The report from Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, was much different.
SNT.102155.8785	"In Friday's riot, at least ten civilians died, mostly from burns caused by the roving mobs and some others were injured," Xinhua said, citing the Tibetan Regional Government's report.
SNT.102155.8786	Additionally, they reported that police in Lhasa had saved 580 people, including an entire school, from the violent array of sabotage.
SNT.102155.8787	Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama, condemned China's reaction to the protests, calling it a "cultural genocide".
SNT.102155.8788	At a press conference in Dharamsala, seat of the Tibetan government in exile, he said, "They simply rely on using force in order to simulate peace, a peace brought by force using a rule of terror."
SNT.102155.8789	He also called for an international organization to investigate the situation in Tibet.
SNT.102155.8790	China has declared a "People's War" against the protesters, vowing to "expose" the Dalai Lama.
SNT.102155.8791	"We must wage a people's war to beat splittism and expose and condemn the malicious acts of these hostile forces and expose the hideous face of the Dalai Lama group to the light of day," officials were quoted as saying.
SNT.102155.8792	China also prevented access to video website YouTube after many international videos of the protests were posted on the website.
SNT.102155.8793	YouTube is normally easily accessible in China, which blocks other pornographic or subversive sites with its 'Great Firewall'.

SNT.323136.8800	The British government have vowed to ban payment fees and other hidden and excessive credit card charges.
SNT.323136.8801	They hope to do so by the end of 2012, following a consultation in the new year.
SNT.323136.8802	Hidden fees are often not shown until the end of an ordering process on the web which prevents consumers from making an informed choice and comparing the actual prices of different products and services according to the Office of Fair Trading.
SNT.323136.8803	Plans are also underway to bring in Europe-wide regulation of credit card fees in 2014.
SNT.323136.8804	Mark Hoban, a Treasury Minister, said consumers "have a right to understand the charges they may incur up front and not be hit through a hidden last-minute payment surcharge."
SNT.323136.8805	He said the plans announced today will increase "transparency" for consumers, and that consumers currently "feel ripped off".
SNT.323136.8806	The Office of Fair Trading have listed some examples of particularly high charges: with EasyJet charging £8, Ryanair £6, and thetrainline.com £3.50 extra to pay for tickets with credit cards.
SNT.323136.8807	The consumer group Which? claimed that these surcharges were increasing the cost of air travel by £265,000 a day (or about £97 million per year).
SNT.323136.8808	The OFT stated that the figure was £300m a year.
SNT.323136.8809	A Wikinews reporter contacted Which? about this disparity but they had not responded at the time of publication.
SNT.634633.8810	Former Roman Catholic priest Bartley Sorensen of the US state of Pennsylvania was yesterday sentenced to eight years and one month in federal prison after pleading guilty to child pornography charges in May 2012.
SNT.634633.8811	Sorenson, now aged 63, was discovered to be downloading child pornography by an employee of his parish at the St. John Fisher Church in Churchill, Allegheny County in December 2011.
SNT.634633.8812	The employee had been tutored on how to distinguish predators.
SNT.634633.8813	Police investigating the case found some 5,000 child pornography images in Sorenson's church office.
SNT.634633.8814	Following Sorenson's release, he will also be supervised for five years.
SNT.634633.8815	Sorenson has also been ordered to pay a fine of $25,000.
SNT.634633.8816	He claimed that he wanted to be caught and left the image on his computer screen in order to be found out and required to go to counselling, but was unaware that it was illegal.

SNT.102990.8821	The Cassini–Huygens spacecraft has discovered "organic material" and water spewing from a geyser on one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus.
SNT.102990.8822	According to NASA, the discovery was made when Cassini flew by the moon on March 12.
SNT.102990.8823	"A completely unexpected surprise is that the chemistry of Enceladus, what's coming out from inside, resembles that of a comet.
SNT.102990.8824	To have primordial material coming out from inside a Saturn moon raises many questions on the formation of the Saturn system," said Hunter Waite, principal investigator for the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer at the Southwest Research Institute located in San Antonio, Texas.
SNT.102990.8825	The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer saw a much higher density of volatile gases, water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as organic materials, some 20 times denser than expected.
SNT.102990.8826	This dramatic increase in density was evident as the spacecraft flew over the area of the plumes.
SNT.102990.8827	New high-resolution heat maps of the south pole by Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer show that the so-called tiger stripes, giant fissures that are the source of the geysers, are warm along almost their entire lengths, and reveal other warm fissures nearby.
SNT.102990.8828	These more precise new measurements reveal temperatures of at least minus 93 degrees Celsius (minus 135 Fahrenheit.)
SNT.102990.8829	That is 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than previously seen and 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than other regions of the moon.
SNT.102990.8830	The warmest regions along the tiger stripes correspond to two of the jet locations seen in Cassini images.
SNT.102990.8831	"Enceladus has got warmth, water and organic chemicals, some of the essential building blocks needed for life.
SNT.102990.8832	We have quite a recipe for life on our hands, but we have yet to find the final ingredient, liquid water, but Enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more," said Dennis Matson, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
SNT.102990.8833	At closest approach, Cassini was only 30 miles from Enceladus.
SNT.102990.8834	When it flew through the plumes it was 120 miles from the moon's surface.
SNT.77620.8835	India have beaten England by nine runs in the second One-Day International of the series at the County Ground, Bristol, England.
SNT.77620.8836	India, having won the toss and elected to bat first, raced to 113 runs after the first twenty overs.
SNT.77620.8837	Sourav Ganguly was caught off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff, who finished the innings as the top performing England bowler, taking 5-56.
SNT.77620.8838	Sachin Tendulkar fell just short of a century, being caught behind on 99 runs.
SNT.77620.8839	Tendulkar was surprised at the decision, and television replays were inconclusive as to whether the ball had hit his glove or not.
SNT.77620.8840	Yuvraj Singh and Rahul Dravid added 63 runs before Singh was dismissed for 49.
SNT.77620.8841	Dravid finished on 92 not out, helping India to an imposing total of 329-7 after fifty overs.
SNT.77620.8842	In reply England started quickly, recording 75 runs off the first ten overs.
SNT.77620.8843	However Munaf Patel took two wickets in two balls to dismiss both the England opening batsmen.
SNT.77620.8844	The England wickets fell regularly after that, with Kevin Pietersen and Paul Collingwood bowled by Piyush Chalwa for 25 and 27 runs respectively.
SNT.77620.8845	Andrew Flintoff was dismissed for just nine runs, and despite 64 runs from Ian Bell, England needed 90 runs from the last eight overs with just three wickets remaining.
SNT.77620.8846	Dimitri Mascarenhas hit 52 runs, including five sixes, and Stuart Broad hit 20 runs off the final over, but it came too late and England fell ten runs short of the 330 run target.
SNT.77620.8847	The third match will be played at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on August 27.
SNT.60231.8848	Anna Nicole Smith, who was born as Vickie Lynn Hogan, was found unconscious in the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida in her 6th floor hotel room.
SNT.60231.8849	One of her attorneys has confirmed that she was pronounced dead at a hospital less than an hour later.
SNT.60231.8850	Paramedics are reported to have performed CPR on the actress and had to have breathing equipment inserted into her chest after a nurse found her passed out in her hotel room and witnesses say that Smith was receiving CPR while the ambulance took her to the hospital around 2:00 p.m. [EST].
SNT.60231.8851	Smith's bodyguard is reported to have given Smith "cardiopulmonary resuscitation" before paramedics arrived.
SNT.60231.8852	This is just tragic and that's all you can say right now and I don't know anything further," said one of Anna Nicole's lawyers, Ron Rale.
SNT.60231.8853	Smith was taken by ambulance to Memorial Regional Hospital and "checked in Monday [to the hotel] at 8 p.m. as a guest.
SNT.60231.8854	She was due to check out tomorrow," said cafe spokeswoman, Danielle Giordaano.
SNT.60231.8855	"Our rescue crews got there, and they were escorted to a bedroom, where they found a female alone in her room and unresponsive.
SNT.60231.8856	We then began our normal protocol for dealing with a non-breathing individual.
SNT.60231.8857	According to Broward County Medical Examiner's Office investigator, Edwina Johnson, an autopsy will be performed on Smith on Friday and that her death is currently being investigated.
SNT.60231.8858	Authorities are not yet treating her death as a crime.
SNT.60231.8859	One of Smith's attorneys, Howard K. Stern, is reported to have been staying with Smith in her room, but authorities have yet to locate Mr. Stern.
SNT.60231.8860	I don't know where he's at right now," said Charlie Tiger the chief of the Seminole Police Department also adding that Smith's 5 month old baby was not with them.
SNT.60231.8861	Smith was a spokeswoman for the company TRIMSPA when she passed, and TrimSpa has removed all content from their site for now, shutting it down and posting only a message in response to her death.
SNT.60231.8862	"Today, Anna Nicole Smith’s grief stricken and tumultuous personal life came to an end.
SNT.60231.8863	Anna came to our Company as a customer, but she departs it as a friend.
SNT.60231.8864	While life for Anna Nicole was not easy these past few months, she held dear her husband, Howard K. Stern, her daughter, Dannielynn Hope, her most cherished friends, beloved dogs, and finally, her work with TRIMSPA.
SNT.60231.8865	Anna knew both the joy of giving life, and the heartache of losing a child.
SNT.60231.8866	We pray that she is granted the peace that eluded her more recent days on earth, and that she find comfort in the presence of her son, Daniel," said the statement on TRIMSPA's website posted by Alex Goen, CEO and Founder of TRIMSPA.
SNT.60231.8867	Smith was rushed to the hospital in November of 2006 after she was suffering from symptoms of pneumonia.
SNT.60231.8868	Smith's son, Daniel Smith, died on September 10, 2006 shortly after Anna gave birth to a baby girl 5 months ago.
SNT.60231.8869	Smith was shopping for a new boat in Florida and reports say she felt ill and had a fever for at least a day.
SNT.62043.8870	A full crowd showed up at the Guiseppe Meazza in Italy today to watch AC Milan take on Scottish side Celtic.
SNT.62043.8871	The first leg of the matches ended in a goalless draw, as both teams were spirited in defense.
SNT.62043.8872	Kaka and Inzaghi played as frontmen for AC, while Vennegoor of Hesselink and Jiri Jarosik were the strike pair for Celtic.
SNT.62043.8873	Milan had the first chance of the game early when Kaka found room and flashed a shot towards the bottom corner, but keeper Artur Boruc got down well to make the stop.
SNT.62043.8874	Celtic then had a valid penalty claim after only 6 minutes when Jarosik's volley looked to be blocked by the hand of Maldini, but referee Konrad Plautz waved away the appeals.
SNT.62043.8875	Celtic's defense continued to play well, and they limited Milan's chances to long ranged shots.
SNT.62043.8876	Lee Naylor then performed defensive heroics for Celtic as he took the ball away from the open Inzaghi, who was waiting to tap the ball in at the back post.
SNT.62043.8877	Kaka had two more shots from range at the net, but neither were on target.
SNT.62043.8878	Naylor again saved Celtic by clearing the ball off the line from a Kaka attempt.
SNT.62043.8879	Over an hour had passed when Gordon Strachan sent Thomas Graveson on for Celtic in place of Jarosik, and the Dane almost scored right away.
SNT.62043.8880	He struck a fine shot at the net, but Massimo Oddo did well to block the attempt.
SNT.62043.8881	Milan counter attacked quickly, and Kaka saw his attempt also blocked by a defender.
SNT.62043.8882	McManus and Naylor were forced to clear headers off the line from Ambrosini and Inzaghi, both occurring after corners.
SNT.62043.8883	Maldini then had a header at the Celtic net, but Boruc was again in the right place to make the stop.
SNT.62043.8884	Celtic had another claim for a penalty when Nakamura was brought down in the area, but the Austrian referee again waved away all appeals.
SNT.62043.8885	Boruc was again forced into action from a Seedorf free kick, which he was able to deflect out with a hand.
SNT.62043.8886	Kaka then shot towards the goal, but the crossbar saved Celtic from going a goal down.
SNT.62043.8887	As 90 minutes approached, Celtic had two well positioned free-kicks, but could take advantage of neither, and the game entered extra time.
SNT.62043.8888	It took Milan little time to go ahead in the extra period, and the scorer would be no other than the Brazilian Kaka.
SNT.62043.8889	The youthful striker put on a burst of speed to beat out the tired Celtic defenders and blasted the ball through Borucs legs to give the homeside the lead.
SNT.62043.8890	The game continued however, as the Champions League works on full extra time, and Celtic still had 27 minutes to equalize.
SNT.62043.8891	It was Milan who pushed however, and Andrea Pirlo twice forced Boruc to make saves.
SNT.62043.8892	Then Kaka, in search of a brace, sent a volley over the net after being left alone during a corner kick.
SNT.62043.8893	Gravesen's long effort for Celtic was easy pickings for Dida, and Craig Beattie headed a good chance over the bar.
SNT.62043.8894	Celtic vainly tried to tie the game, bringing on Kenny Miller, but AC finished the game comfortably, and advanced to the next round of the tournament.
SNT.659688.8895	Residents of Santa Clara County, California expressed their opposition at a public hearing Thursday January 31 to a local detainment provision of the Secure Communities program of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
SNT.659688.8896	Secure Communities includes a provision that ICE can ask state and local detention facilities to hold anyone arrested who might be in the US without adequate documentation until ICE has time to review their case.
SNT.659688.8897	The comments came in a public hearing of a policy working group of the Public Safety and Justice Committee, convened to discuss a November 7 recommendation by District Attorney Jeff Rosen to honor ICE detainer requests for serious and violent offenders.
SNT.659688.8898	Since October 18, 2011, Santa Clara County has refused ICE requests to detain individuals who would otherwise be released.
SNT.659688.8899	Another opportunity for public comment on this occurred this Thursday, at the monthly meeting of the Public Safety and Justice Committee of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors.
SNT.659688.8900	Supporters of DA Rosen's proposal had earlier asked their people to email the supervisors and attend this meeting and the Board of Supervisors' Meeting next Tuesday, February 12.
SNT.659688.8901	The January 31 hearing began with comments by approximately 25 of the audience of roughly 35–40, all of which opposed the DA's proposal.
SNT.659688.8902	They said public safety was enhanced under the current policy because many in the immigrant community have less reason to fear that they or people they care about would be deported if the police were called.
SNT.659688.8903	Sheriff Laurie Smith then described an individual who is now in prison with a rape conviction for an event that would have been prevented if the detention request from ICE had been honored.
SNT.659688.8904	Several in the audience replied by asking how many other criminals would go free because people refused to report or testify as a result of increased fear of deportation.
SNT.659688.8905	Comments supporting the current policy have been made by people who did not attend.
SNT.659688.8906	The San Jose Mercury News for January 31 includes an op ed by Supervisor Dave Cortese, acting Public Defender Molly O'Neal, and Director of the Domestic Violence Advocacy Consortium Cynthia Hunter.
SNT.659688.8907	They wrote, "There is nothing more valuable to public safety than community trust in local law enforcement because it establishes residents' willingness to report crimes and cooperate with police.
SNT.659688.8908	But that trust will break down immeasurably in immigrant communities if residents face the debilitating fear of deportation.
SNT.659688.8909	This is especially true in Santa Clara County, where two-thirds of residents live in immigrant households."
SNT.659688.8910	Since the January 31 hearing, support for the position of the Sheriff and the DA has begun to materialize with at least one conservative group asking their followers to email the supervisors and attend public meetings such as the one this Thursday and the Board of Supervisors' meeting next Tuesday, February 12.
SNT.659688.8911	The policy adopted October 18, 2011 stated Santa Clara County would honor ICE detention requests "for individuals who have been convicted of a serious or violent felony," provided ICE agreed in writing to reimburse the county for the additional expense.
SNT.659688.8912	DA Rosen's November 7 presentation claimed honoring ICE holds would "produce an undetermined amount of cost savings by reducing probation costs", as individuals otherwise on probation would be transferred to federal detention.
SNT.659688.8913	Reports from Colorado and Los Angeles have claimed that ICE holds averaged over 20 days.
SNT.659688.8914	ICE claims an official limit of at most two days.
SNT.659688.8915	Los Angeles is currently being sued over questionable detentions of a number of individuals including a British filmmaker named Duncan Roy, who was held for 89 days.
SNT.659688.8916	If Los Angeles loses, it appears local taxpayers may be liable.
SNT.659688.8917	After DA Rosen's presentation on November 7, the Santa Clara County Public Safety and Justice Committee referred this issue to its policy review working group, which held various private meetings, failed to reach a consensus, and then organized the public meeting of January 31.
SNT.659688.8918	The next official action on this issue is currently scheduled for the March 7 meeting of the Public Safety and Justice Committee.
SNT.248695.8919	United States soldier Bradley Manning, accused of leaking US state secrets to WikiLeaks and detained under restrictive conditions at the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia since July 2010, was ordered Wednesday to sleep stripped of all clothing.
SNT.248695.8920	According to his attorney, this condition was imposed because Manning made a "sarcastic quip" about the harsh conditions of his confinement.
SNT.248695.8921	For most of the eight months he has been held there, Manning has been required to sleep only in his boxer shorts because he has been under "prevention of injury watch," according to First Lieutenant Brian Villiard, a spokesman for the Quantico facility.
SNT.248695.8922	David Coombs, Manning's legal representative for the upcoming court marshal, said that on Wednesday Manning complained of his clothing restrictions and joked that if he wanted to, he might be able to harm himself "with the elastic waistband of his underwear or with his flip-flops."
SNT.248695.8923	On Wednesday night, the brig commander determined that Manning must give up his boxer shorts also.
SNT.248695.8924	Villiard said, "The intention is to ensure the safety and security of the detainee and make sure he is able to stand trial."
SNT.248695.8925	Villiard, citing privacy rules designed to protect the detainees, did not explain how Manning could harm himself if allowed to wear his underwear.
SNT.248695.8926	Coombs said Manning was not put under a suicide watch because that would have required the decision of a mental health professional.
SNT.248695.8927	As a result of the tightening of Manning's conditions, he will be required for the indefinite future to sleep naked in his cell, and endure, according to Coombs, the "humiliation of standing naked at attention for the morning roll call".
SNT.248695.8928	In a statement, Senator John Kerry suggested recent publicity will cast light on Manning's situation and the balance between humane treatment and suicide prevention: "I think that a lot of people are now reviewing this very, very closely, people have weighed in, myself included, I think that analyses are being made.
SNT.248695.8929	And I'm convinced that there will be real scrutiny with respect to that issue."
SNT.53644.8930	On November 13, Torontoians will be heading to the polls to vote for their ward's councillor and for mayor.
SNT.53644.8931	This ward's candidates include Francis Ahinful, Ted Berger, Anthony Caputo, Suzan Hall (incumbent), Andre Lucas, Rosemarie Mulhall, Brian Prevost, and Sonali Verma.

SNT.131075.8933	Police in Kenya have arrested a man thought to be the organiser of an attack by up to 30 men armed with clubs and spears that killed internationally renowned Scottish gemstone expert Campbell Bridges.
SNT.131075.8934	The 71-year-old was ambushed last week near Voi where he owns several mines.
SNT.131075.8935	Bridges' family had received death threats for years over a dispute over access to his gemstone mines.
SNT.131075.8936	Regional police chief Herbert Khaemba anounced today: "The suspect believed to be the main organiser of the brutal murder was arrested by the police at the Kenyan border town of Taveta in hiding.
SNT.131075.8937	The police are still pursuing other suspects who were armed with crude weapons during the attack."
SNT.131075.8938	The arrested man is reported to be the chairman of a group of local small-scale miners.
SNT.131075.8939	He is thought to have been intending to flee to neighbouring Tanzania.
SNT.131075.8940	The area's minerals have been disputed ever since Bridges discovered the locally unique stone Tsavorite in the 1960s.
SNT.82106.8941	The Pakistani army says that at least 150 to 200 Taliban militants, along with 50 Pakistani troops have been killed in recent battles between al-Qaeda, Taliban fighters and Pakistani troops along the border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan in an area known as North Waziristan.
SNT.82106.8942	At least 20 other troops were injured and at least 15 are reported to be missing.
SNT.82106.8943	"We have told them to surrender and give up their weapons," said Major General of the Pakistani army, Waheed Arshad.
SNT.82106.8944	Militants say that they are going to attempt to overthrow the government and take the newly elected Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf out of power.
SNT.82106.8945	The battles began on Saturday October 6 in the town of Mir Ali and have lasted three days so far.
SNT.82106.8946	Army officials say that they will "continue punitive action until complete peace is restored."
SNT.82106.8947	The battles were triggered after several Pakistani officials were targeted and peace talks with officials in Islamabad failed to go forward.
SNT.82106.8948	In September, Osama bin Laden issued a new audio tape in which he told militants to resist Pakistani troops and rebel against the army.
SNT.82106.8949	He also asked militants to seek revenge for the assault on the Red Mosque when almost 100 were killed by militants and troops.
SNT.39106.8950	Major distributors of the operating system Linux have agreed on a new standard that includes common elements for desktop software, in a move to make Linux a more effective competitor to Microsoft Windows.
SNT.39106.8951	The Free Standards Group (FSG) will unveil the Linux Standard Base (LSB) 3.1 on Tuesday at the Desktop Linux Summit in San Diego.
SNT.39106.8952	The first distribution to include LSB 3.1 support, Xandros, is expected to be released on May 1, followed shortly by versions by Red Hat, Novell, and others.
SNT.39106.8953	The status of Ubuntu's upcoming version is still unclear .
SNT.39106.8954	The standards aim to resolve difficulties that programmers face in developing software for Linux.
SNT.39106.8955	Because Linux, developed by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, defines the kernel or core of the operating system, there is a wide variety of graphical interfaces for it and differing software libraries.
SNT.39106.8956	LSB 3.1 standardizes core pieces of Linux to make development easier.
SNT.39106.8957	"One of the big things that's difficult is consistency, and that's Windows' biggest strength," Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Free Standards Group, told the Associated Press.
SNT.39106.8958	"If you buy a Windows program, you know it will run on a Windows computer, and Linux needs to work the same way.
SNT.39106.8959	If you really want to become a broadly adopted and used technology, you have to have that degree of standardization," he said.
SNT.1039242.8960	Samer al-Issawi, a Palestinian prisoner who went on a hunger strike in an Israeli prison as a protest against his imprisonment, was released on Monday to his home in .
SNT.1039242.8961	Issawi returned Monday to his home in the Issawiyeh neighborhood in East Jerusalem after his release from the Shatta prison in northern Israel.
SNT.1039242.8962	Hundreds of people came to welcome him home and celebrate his release, despite an Israeli order given to his family not to have a public party for his arrival.
SNT.1039242.8963	After his release, Issawi said during a TV interview, "It is our obligation as freedom fighters to free all the Palestinian political prisoners!".
SNT.1039242.8964	Issawi was arrested in 2002 in , during the by the Israeli army for shooting at Israeli vehicles and reportedly also charged with making pipe bombs.
SNT.1039242.8965	He was sentenced to more than 25 years in prison.
SNT.1039242.8966	In 2011, during a prisoner exchange deal Israel made with Hamas, Issawi was released along with over a thousand other Palestinian prisoners.
SNT.1039242.8967	He was released under restrictive conditions and forbidden to go outside of Jerusalem, his residence.
SNT.1039242.8968	However, after only nine months from his release date he was arrested again for breaking the conditions.
SNT.1039242.8969	He was required to serve the rest of the 2002 sentence and stay in prison till 2029.
SNT.1039242.8970	As a protest against the punishment, Issawi began a publicized hunger strike.
SNT.1039242.8971	For more than 260 days he was fed water, vitamins, and additional materials only by infusion.
SNT.1039242.8972	According to the Los Angeles Times, Israel decided to start a negotiation lest Issawi's death in the Israeli prison cause violence from the Palestinians in the .
SNT.1039242.8973	In the end, Issawi agreed to stay in the Israeli prison for an additional eight months to serve the administrative arrest he was under and in exchange he stopped his hunger strike.
SNT.55919.8974	Kevin Rudd has been elected as leader of the Labor party by the party's caucus.
SNT.55919.8975	His running-mate Julia Gillard was elected unopposed to the deputy leadership.
SNT.55919.8976	The vote was called on Friday after Kevin Rudd challenged former leader Kim Beazley for the leadership.
SNT.55919.8977	Rudd becomes the party's third leader since the 2004 election, where the Howard government won a fourth consecutive term in government.
SNT.55919.8978	Long-serving deputy leader Jenny Macklin did not contest the deputy leadership following the defeat of Mr Beazley.
SNT.55919.8979	Mrs Macklin has been deputy leader under three leaders since 2001.
SNT.55919.8980	The party will elect its shadow ministry in a separate ballot on Thursday.
SNT.55919.8981	Premier of Queensland Peter Beattie has said that the leadership change "will herald in a new period of stability for the party."
SNT.55919.8982	"It's important that if you have good policy and good government, it's important you also have stability in leadership," said Beattie.
SNT.55919.8983	"I'd urge everyone to get behind Kevin - having a Queenslander as the alternative prime minister is good for the state and good for Australia."
SNT.55919.8984	Labor MP Dick Adams said even though he voted for Beazley to remain as leader, he supports the party's new leadership.
SNT.55919.8985	"There'll be a lot more harmony and a lot more opportunity of ideas," he said.
SNT.55919.8986	"I think the new ideas need to flow and I think if it's opened up, as some people have said, they want those ideas to come forward, but I think we'll have some interesting policy direction to take to the people."
SNT.55919.8987	Sharan Burrow, the president of the ACTU - the peak union body in Australia said Mr Rudd will be a strong leader.
SNT.55919.8988	"I have no doubt that Kevin Rudd will say that these laws have to go, that they will be replaced by a policy that reinstates rights," Ms Burrow has told Sky News.
SNT.55919.8989	Government MP, Christopher Pyne said that the new leadership was a poor choice for the party.
SNT.55919.8990	"The combination of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard will have all the hallmarks of the mongoose and the cobra.
SNT.55919.8991	It shows Labor is obsessed about leadership rather than policy and strategy," Mr Pyne said.
SNT.55919.8992	In a poll released by Newspoll today, a Rudd-Gillard leadership team had 48 percent support of the public, compared to the outgoing Beazley-Macklin team's 27 percent.
SNT.198363.8993	Two games of round 16 of the Gippsland Football League split the round over the weekend.
SNT.198363.8994	On Saturday, Sale defeated Moe by 75 points, while on Sunday, Warragul lost to Drouin.
SNT.198363.8995	The split round will be completed next weekend with Leongatha traveling to Maffra and Morwell travelling to Wonthaggi.
SNT.198363.8996	The preliminary ladder has, in order, Maffra on top followed by Traralgon, Morwell, Drouin and Leongatha in the the top five.
SNT.198363.8997	Moe and Sale need to win both of their remaining games and have other results go their way to make the finals.
SNT.198363.8998	The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major Australian rules football competition in the rural region east from Melbourne to the New South Wales border, according to the Victorian Country Football League.
SNT.117104.8999	At 10:30pm on November 23, 2008, near the airport in McGregor, Texas, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) tested their new Falcon 9 rocket at full thrust for nearly 3 minutes (160 seconds).
SNT.117104.9000	The engineers then shut down two of the nine engines — in order to limit potential damage to the launch pad — and continued the test for 18 more seconds before finally shutting the rocket down.
SNT.117104.9001	"We ran the engines just like they would run during flight, but instead of being up in the air, they were held down.
SNT.117104.9002	They weren’t moving," said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX's manager for business development.
SNT.117104.9003	This was the Falcon 9's first major test firing, and it marks a milestone for the company in its plans to capture a section of the commercial launch market.
SNT.117104.9004	The test reportedly shook the windows of houses 5 miles away, causing agitation among residents who felt that they had not received adequate warning.
SNT.117104.9005	"I appreciate the fact that the company notified [the City of] McGregor, but did they not think the test would affect the surrounding communities?" asked commenter Lorena Resident on the website for the Waco Tribune-Herald.
SNT.117104.9006	The Falcon 9 rocket, and its smaller sibling the Falcon 1, are the first rockets capable of entering Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to have their design be privately funded in its entirety.
SNT.117104.9007	According to SpaceX the Falcon 9 can generate 4 times the maximum thrust of a Boeing 747 while firing in a vacuum, and will eventually be able to perform interplanetary missions in addition to its initial role as an orbital launch vehicle.
SNT.117104.9008	SpaceX is also designing a crew and cargo capsule for the Falcon 9, which it has named the "Dragon".
SNT.117104.9009	SpaceX is a contender for future commercial contracts from various government run space agencies, with NASA expressing particular interest.
SNT.117104.9010	NASA will be retiring their fleet of Columbia Class Space Shuttles in 2010, but will not have the Shuttles' replacements (the Ares I and Ares V rockets) ready until at least 2014.
SNT.117104.9011	NASA hopes to fill some of this gap using commercial launches from companies such as SpaceX.
SNT.117104.9012	SpaceX has already reached an agreement with NASA to conduct three test flights of the Dragon capsule in conjunction with the Falcon 9.
SNT.117104.9013	Elon Musk, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, said, "The full mission-length test firing clears the highest hurdle for the Falcon 9 first stage before launch.
SNT.117104.9014	In the next few months, we will have the first Falcon 9 flight vehicle on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, preparing for lift-off in 2009."
SNT.11728.9015	French police are holding a 31-year-old who managed to convince social workers and fellow students that he was a 15-year-old Spanish orphan and spent a whole month attending school.
SNT.11728.9016	Frederic Bourdin's alias was discovered when a teacher watched a television program about his exploits and his numerous identities.
SNT.11728.9017	Claire Chadourne, headmistress at the College Jean-Monnet, said, "He seemed a little older than his classmates, two or three years at the most.
SNT.11728.9018	Bourdin, who speaks at least five languages, told social workers and classmates that his name was Francisco Hernandez-Fernandez and that his parents had been killed in a car crash in 2000 and that he'd spent three months in a coma.
SNT.11728.9019	He claimed that after being placed into foster care, he was sexually abused and that he escaped to France.
SNT.11728.9020	He told his teacher that he had horrible scars that he wished to hide and was given special permission to wear a cap to hide his balding.
SNT.11728.9021	In 1997, Bourdin was arrested and imprisoned for six years in the United States for posing a Texas couple's 14-year-old son, who disappeared three years earlier.
SNT.11728.9022	He managed to convince the couple that he was their son even though he had brown eyes and a heavy French accent.
SNT.11728.9023	Bourdin lived with the couple for three months before a journalist exposed him and his lies were confirmed by a DNA test.
SNT.11728.9024	Returning from the United States in 2003, Bourdin showed up in the southeastern Alps, where he claimed to be Leo Balley, who went missing in 1996 when he was seven-years-old and camping with his father.
SNT.11728.9025	He says he assumes other identities as a way of receiving the attention he never got as a child.
SNT.8821.9026	Children who spend more time playing with other children are less likely to end up getting childhood cancers, a UK study published today in the British Medical Journal has found.
SNT.8821.9027	The finding supports the researchers' theory that reduced exposure to common infections in the first year of life increases the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
SNT.8821.9028	A total of nearly 10,000 children took part in the study, located in 10 regions across the UK.
SNT.8821.9029	Amount of time spent in daycare and social activity, during the first year of life, were used to gauge the level of exposure of the infants to common infections such as cold and flu.
SNT.8821.9030	Day care in the first year of life for at least two days a week, with at least three other kids, halved a child's chance of contracting ALL.
SNT.8821.9031	Those who were rated in the category "any social activity" still had an improvement over the children rated as "no social activity": they had about 3/4 the chance of getting the disease.
SNT.8821.9032	The study describes that effect was "more striking" for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia — a cancer affecting blood and the immune system — than it was for the set of all other cancers.
SNT.8821.9033	Increasing levels of activity saw decreasing chances of childhood cancers, when compared against children who during their first year had no regular social activity outside the home.
SNT.8821.9034	Theories have been around since the 1940s that childhood exposure to infection was related to the development of childhood leukaemia — one, like the working theory of the UK study, said that lack of immune challenge was a factor, another that leukaemia developed as a delayed result of some type of infection.
SNT.8821.9035	The research was conducted by the Institute of Cancer Research in London and in Sutton, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of York, Christie Hospital and Central Manchester and Manchester Children's University Hospitals NHS Trusts, and the University of Edinburgh.
SNT.72501.9036	Team New Zealand have defeated Swiss syndicate Alinghi in the second race of the 32nd America's Cup Challenge on Sunday, making the overall score equal with one win for each team.
SNT.72501.9037	Team New Zealand, racing with NZL-92, crossed the start line three seconds ahead of Alinghi's yacht, SUI-100.
SNT.72501.9038	But Alinghi led the race at the first mark by 13 seconds, though near the ending of the race, Team New Zealand managed to overtake Alinghi to lead the final leg of the race by 28 seconds.
SNT.72501.9039	Former Alinghi and Team New Zealand skipper, Russell Coutts said that the latest win for Team New Zealand will act as a big boost for them.
SNT.72501.9040	Ray Davis, Team New Zealand after-guard, said, "It’s been huge for the team to get a win on the board in the America’s Cup.
SNT.72501.9041	It has been a long time coming for Emirates Team New Zealand."
SNT.72501.9042	Dan Cowie, Team New Zealand trimmer, said, "As we said yesterday there are two very even boats out there.
SNT.72501.9043	The next race is scheduled for tomorrow, Monday being a race-off day.
SNT.72501.9044	The last time Alinghi and Team New Zealand fought for the America's Cup was when Team New Zealand was defending the trophy in Auckland, New Zealand.
SNT.72501.9045	The past three consecutive America's Cup challenges have been all whitewash victories, and five of the last six challenges have also been whitewashes.
SNT.10985.9046	After its first appearance in the 3rd Division, Pavlos Melas Soccer Club finished in the 14th position and was relegated, despite its 2-1 victory over Doxa Dramas Football Club, with 36 points in 32 games.
SNT.10985.9047	The team from Salonika, Greece will be a serious contender for the championship in the 4th Division.
SNT.10985.9048	Former Olympiacos SFC player Alekos Tatsis, almost Anderlecht, Belgium's starlet, was released free by OSFC.
SNT.10985.9049	Pavlos Melas was planning to sign him, but after the relegation, Tatsis probably won't join the "Greens".
SNT.117257.9050	An Airbus A320 airliner owned by Air New Zealand crashed into the Mediterranean Sea near Perpignan, killing at least two of a crew of seven, French officials reported on Thursday.
SNT.117257.9051	The aircraft crashed at about 5 p.m. local time (1600 UTC) during a test flight.
SNT.117257.9052	The twin-engine jet airliner had just undergone maintenance at Perpignan in preparation for its return to Air New Zealand by German airline XL Airways, which had been operating it on lease.
SNT.117257.9053	The seven on board included two XL Airways crew, Civil Aviation Authority inspector Jeremy Cook of Wellington, and four Air New Zealand personnel.
SNT.117257.9054	Air New Zealand has identified involved personnel as Captain Brian Horrell and Murray White of Auckland, and Michael Gyles and Noel Marsh of Christchurch.
SNT.117257.9055	No additional passengers were on board for the flight, which was part of a maintenance test procedure.
SNT.117257.9056	Though rescue efforts persisted into the night, there is no hope of the remaining five crew members being found alive, according to French officials.
SNT.117257.9057	The pilots may have attempted an emergency landing on water.
SNT.117257.9058	French, German, and New Zealand aviation authorities and investigators have been dispatched to the site to investigate the incident.
SNT.117257.9059	Manufacturer Airbus, based in Toulouse, will aid the investigation, Airbus spokespersons stated.
SNT.117257.9060	A Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson stated that the incident does not cast any doubt on the airworthiness of the A320 design, a popular aircraft which has been involved in only ten fatal accidents since its introduction in 1987.
SNT.56382.9061	A Japanese official has stated that Japan is opposed to re-entering into six-party talks between the United States, China, Russia, South Korea, and North Korea in regards to the N. Korean nuclear weapons program stating that N. Korea must "compromise."
SNT.56382.9062	"It's fine if North Korea can bring some contribution to peace, but simply starting talks is not meaningful," said the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council in Japan, Shoichi Nakagawa.
SNT.56382.9063	"The situation has changed since the last six-party talks in September last year.
SNT.56382.9064	North Korea has conducted missile test launches and undertaken a nuclear test.
SNT.56382.9065	North Korea successfully tested a nuclear missile on October 9, 2006.
SNT.56382.9066	We believe it is necessary for North Korea to show concrete actions toward the abandonment of all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs," said Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan.
SNT.56382.9067	Six-party talks are said to resume on December 18, 2006.
SNT.37974.9068	Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced a five year plan costing AU$1.8 billion to address issues with the country's mental health system.
SNT.37974.9069	The plan follows a commitment made at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting in February.
SNT.37974.9070	The federal government will improve access to clinical and health services, increase the number of mental health professionals in Australia, create mental health work teams consisting of GPs, psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health nurses, provide respite services for people suffering mental illness and their carers, and introduce new programs for community awareness.
SNT.37974.9071	Mr Howard said the plan addresses issues which fall into its area of responsibility.
SNT.37974.9072	He hopes that the states and territories will complement the federal government's package by investing in supported accommodation, hospital and emergency services, crisis care services and the provision of mental health care in gaols.
SNT.37974.9073	Under the federal government's plan, psychologists will play a greater role in the mental health system.
SNT.37974.9074	From November, Patients will be able to claim a rebate from Medicare (Australia's universal healthcare scheme) for the services of psychologists if they have been referred by a GP or psychiatrist.
SNT.37974.9075	At present patients pay around $100 for a standard 30 minute consultation.
SNT.37974.9076	Mr Howard claims that there is an issue for mental health professionals in treating patients with a substance abuse problem and mental illness.
SNT.37974.9077	To address this the government will provide extra funding for drug and alcohol rehabilitation services.
SNT.37974.9078	The government will increase the mental health workforce by funding an additional 400 mental health nursing and 200 clinical psychology places.
SNT.37974.9079	The government has promised increase funding for telephone counselling and suicide prevention services, living skills programs and additional support for those with a mental illness who are having difficulty finding or keeping work.
SNT.37974.9080	The government will also provide 900 personal helpers and mentors, increase funding for living skills programs and provide additional employment assistance to those who have difficulty finding or retaining employment due to their illness.
SNT.23801.9081	The Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, despatched an additional 1,000 troops to the south of the country to help deal with the widespread violence.
SNT.23801.9082	This brings the total number of security forces operating in the three troubled provinces to approximately 30,000.
SNT.23801.9083	Mr. Shinawatra's recent visit to the region was followed by further shootings.
SNT.23801.9084	In Narathiwat Province a 40 year old village worker was shot while helping a neighbour repair a fence.
SNT.23801.9085	Friday saw the shooting of an assistant village head in Yala Province, and an elderly couple were shot in Pattani Province whilst returning from a local market.
SNT.23801.9086	The insurgency and campaign for an independent Muslim state in the southern provinces has resulted in an exodus from the area.
SNT.23801.9087	Estimates put the number of Thai Buddhists who have fled the area at 34,000.
SNT.23801.9088	There are also some reports that Muslim inhabitants of the area have been seeking refuge in Malaysia.
SNT.23801.9089	The state of emergency imposed last month has had a mixed reception.
SNT.23801.9090	Largely favoured by Buddhists in the provinces, this grants additional powers to the Prime Minister and follows on from martial law having been in place since January 2004.
SNT.23801.9091	Despite these security measures, over 1,000 people have died in the insurgency.
SNT.143640.9092	An aide to ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya said that a deal designed to end the country's political crisis has failed, after interim leader Roberto Micheletti announced the formation of a new cabinet.
SNT.143640.9093	Micheletti said late on Thursday that he is installing a national unity government without the participation of Zelaya, who has declined to name any cabinet members.
SNT.143640.9094	The two signed an agreement last week to resolve the four-month political standoff.
SNT.143640.9095	Zelaya warned on Thursday the accord was at risk of collapsing unless the Honduran Congress held a vote to restore him to power immediately to serve out his term that ends in January.
SNT.143640.9096	Congress must vote on Zelaya's restitution, but has not yet done so.
SNT.143640.9097	The recently signed pact does not stipulate a deadline for the Congressional vote.
SNT.143640.9098	The United States, a major broker in the mediation efforts, said this week the next step in the political crisis is up to Honduras.
SNT.143640.9099	The governments of several countries have threatened not to recognize the presidential elections if Zelaya is not first returned to power.
SNT.143640.9100	Zelaya was ousted in a military-backed coup in June, but returned to Honduras in September, where he has taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa.
SNT.78092.9101	Thousands of Greeks gathered last night in Syntagma square in front of the parliament building in Athens to protest over the political response to the fires.
SNT.78092.9102	An estimated 8,000 people attended, after a call for a silent protest had been distributed through e-mail, text messages and eventually the media.
SNT.78092.9103	Although general elections are taking place in two and a half weeks time, the protest was meant to be apolitical.
SNT.78092.9104	Some protesters taunted riot police, who responded with stun grenades.
SNT.167648.9105	Wikipedia, one of the top ten websites on the internet, will soon be receiving a face lift.
SNT.167648.9106	The first part of the change is a new skin called Vector.
SNT.167648.9107	This skin, currently used on Wikinews, will be enabled for Wikipedia on April 5th and provide a more updated look and feel.
SNT.167648.9108	The second part will change the toolbar when editing, and is intended to ease common tasks.
SNT.167648.9109	Both changes are important to encourage new people to edit and update content.
SNT.167648.9110	The improvements have been tested by more than 500,000 beta-testers.
SNT.167648.9111	The wiki code will also be altered; editors will be able to change tables data and other elements with what is intended as an easier form, in addition to editing an article while watching it.
SNT.167648.9112	On the other hand, the staff of Wikimedia requested more editors to add and update articles in their wikis.
SNT.167648.9113	Wikipedia is a website maintained by users in unprecedented numbers.
SNT.167648.9114	Maintenance and updating processes are dependent on just one percent of their users.
SNT.167648.9115	Based on some statements, fewer than a thousand users do the maintenance and updating work.
SNT.41402.9116	According to family, former United States senator for Texas and former Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen has died at the age of 85 in his home located in Houston, Texas.
SNT.41402.9117	Bentsen is most famous for his words during a Vice Presidential debate on October 5, 1988.
SNT.41402.9118	Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, the Republican candidate for Vice President, compared his congressional experience to that of former President John F. Kennedy when he sought the presidency.
SNT.41402.9119	The sharp rebuke, however, didn't save Bentsen, as George H.W. Bush and Quayle defeated Michael Dukakis and Bentsen in the 1988 elections.
SNT.41402.9120	In 1998, Bentsen suffered a small stroke, which he said was caused by a 3-month long trip to 15 different nations.
SNT.41402.9121	Bentsen was born on February 11, 1921 and represented the state of Texas for 28 years.
SNT.141897.9122	The French government confirmed on Wednesday that it has expelled illegal Afghan immigrants in its first joint deportation flight with the UK, in a move criticised by the opposition and human rights groups.
SNT.141897.9123	The deportation was widely anticipated, but the French government had refused to confirm that it would be expelling Afghan illegal immigrants until Wednesday.
SNT.141897.9124	Immigration Minister Eric Besson told Europe One radio that three Afghan men had been put on a plane that had been chartered by the British government.
SNT.141897.9125	The plane was also carrying illegal Afghan immigrants living in Britain.
SNT.141897.9126	Besson said a fourth Afghan had been slated to be expelled as well, but was held back at the last minute.
SNT.141897.9127	He said those expelled had lost their appeals against deportation, including one before the European Court of Human Rights.
SNT.141897.9128	He said that he will not rule out future deportation flights with Britain.
SNT.141897.9129	The expulsions have sparked widespread outcry on the part of human rights groups and opposition politicians, including Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe.
SNT.141897.9130	The French rights group France Terre d'Asile has gathered thousands of signatures in a petition against deportation.
SNT.141897.9131	Marie-Helene Senay, communications director for France Terre d'Asile, said she opposed the deporting of Afghans back to their country, which has been torn by conflict, even if they do not meet asylum requirements in France.
SNT.141897.9132	The French government, however, has argued that it is only trying to crack down on human smuggling rings and that illegal immigrants are given every legal recourse to remain in France.
SNT.141897.9133	Immigration Minister Besson defended the decision, saying that "if France never sends people back, it becomes the target for people traffickers."
SNT.141897.9134	He added that the three men put on the flight were from the Afghan capital of Kabul, "where there is no risk for them", and would be given monetary assistance to help them settle back into Afghanistan.
SNT.108659.9135	The three 100 foot reinforced concrete sugar storage silos around which the investigation into the 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion is centred have been demolished.
SNT.108659.9136	The February industrial disaster killed 13 people when the Imperial Sugar refinery at Port Wentworth, United States exploded.
SNT.108659.9137	The initial investigation concluded the disaster to have been a dust explosion that ignited under the silos, but investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) have been hampered as OSHA declared them to be unsafe after the accident.
SNT.108659.9138	A 7,000lb wrecking ball has now been brought in and demolished the structures, which were 18 inches thick.
SNT.108659.9139	This will allow access for investigators, and make way for replacement silos and a new sugar packaging building, which are scheduled to be in place by Summer 2009.
SNT.108659.9140	The refinery hopes to restart sugar processing by the end of the year.
SNT.108659.9141	Imperial vice president Brian Harrison, who is overseeing reconstruction at the site, said of the move "Several people have indicated to me it's a passage from the old to the new and a significant sign of the progress we're making to rebuild."
SNT.108659.9142	2.8 million pounds of fire-hardened sugar were still present in one silo, and 500,000 pounds in another.
SNT.108659.9143	Imperial brought in a crane with a bucket to retrieve this and intends to recycle it for ethanol production.
SNT.108659.9144	Four workers are still hospitalised after the explosion, three in critical condition.
SNT.108659.9145	The disaster is also blamed for a $15.5 million loss Imperial posted in this year's first quarter.
SNT.784189.9146	The United Kingdom House of Commons voted 272–285 last night against proposed possible military action against Syria following claims the Assad regime used chemical weapons against civilians.
SNT.784189.9147	The government motion was defeated by opposition from the Labour Party, as well as rebel MPs from both the Conservative and Liberal Democratic parties.
SNT.784189.9148	David Cameron argued the recent events in Syria were a "humanitarian catastrophe, and if there are no consequences for it, there is nothing to stop Assad and other dictators from using these weapons again and again".
SNT.784189.9149	The motion rejected by the Commons said the House "agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action", and such action would be "legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria's chemical weapons".
SNT.784189.9150	Thirty Conservative MPs and nine Liberal Democrats voted against their party against military intervention.
SNT.784189.9151	Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the proposal to go to war was an "ill-thought through action", it lacked international support, and Cameron had acted in a "cavalier and reckless" manner.
SNT.784189.9152	Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg said the sole intention of the government's motion was to "relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring and disrupting the further use of chemical weapons".
SNT.784189.9153	"President Obama's intentions are highly limited and so are ours."
SNT.784189.9154	The former foreign secretary and Conservative MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind said during the debate: "The Assad regime in Damascus are watching very carefully as to whether they will get away with what they have done."
SNT.784189.9155	Opposition came also from Britain's smaller parties: Caroline Lucas from the Green Party said the actions "cannot be justified", and expressed concern that the United Kingdom would be "flouting international law" by going into Syria.
SNT.784189.9156	Respect MP George Galloway argued there was "no compelling evidence" of Syrian government involvement in the chemical weapons attack.
SNT.784189.9157	Labour proposed an opposing motion that called for the government to present "compelling" evidence before action, which was rejected as well as the government's motion.
SNT.784189.9158	The defeat of the government motion for military intervention has surprised some.
SNT.784189.9159	Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said "Parliament is entirely unpredictable sometimes and I don't think many people saw this coming."
SNT.784189.9160	Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, confirmed that following the vote, the country would not participate in any action in Syria, but he noted he expected the United States to carry on without the UK, anticipating "the US and other countries will continue to look at responses to the chemical attack."
SNT.784189.9161	"They will be disappointed that Britain will not be involved."
SNT.784189.9162	"I don't expect that the lack of British participation will stop any action."
SNT.784189.9163	Hammond noted the rejection of military intervention would strain the "special relationship" between Britain and the United States.
SNT.784189.9164	The former leader of the British Army, General Lord Dannatt, said the vote in the Commons was a "victory for common sense".
SNT.784189.9165	The United States has said they will still seek military action against the Syrian regime.
SNT.784189.9166	US defense secretary Chuck Hagel said the US would seek to build an "international coalition".
SNT.784189.9167	Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House, reacted to the British vote by saying: "The US will continue to consult with the UK Government — one of our closest allies and friends."
SNT.784189.9168	Hayden said that President Obama "will be guided by what is in the best interests of the United States", and that Obama "believes that there are core interests at stake for the United States... countries who violate international norms regarding chemical weapons need to be held accountable".
SNT.784189.9169	Representative Eliot Engel, a Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the White House had told them "beyond a doubt [...] chemical weapons were used, and used intentionally by the Assad regime", and that there is evidence from intercepted communications of involvement by "high-level Syrian officials".
SNT.784189.9170	The Parliamentary vote on intervention in Syria is on the front pages of many of the national newspapers in Britain, with The Times claiming Cameron was "humiliated" by the vote.
SNT.64513.9171	It was an unusual ending to Thursday's game at U.S. Cellular Field between the Chicago White Sox and the Cleveland Indians.
SNT.64513.9172	With the game tied in the bottom of the ninth inning, Cleveland pitcher Roberto Hernández hit batter A.J. Pierzynski with the bases loaded, walking in the winning run.
SNT.64513.9174	Grady Sizemore got things started for the Indians by hitting a solo home run in the first, but the Sox would tie it up in the second on a Paul Konerko RBI groundout.
SNT.64513.9175	Another Indian homer came from the bat of Jason Michaels, but the Sox again tie it up in the fourth with Tadahito Iguchi hitting an RBI sacrifice fly.

SNT.64513.9179	Chicago starter Mark Buehrle left the game in the second inning suffering from bruising on his forearm after being hit just below the elbow of his pitching arm.

SNT.64513.9181	Matt Thornton is credited a blown save for giving up Chicago's one run lead in the eighth.
SNT.64513.9182	Cleveland starter Jeremy Sowers pitched the first six innings, giving up just a hit and two runs.

SNT.102789.9184	The government of China has claimed that the Dalai Lama is cooperating with Islamic extremists as part of a plot to bring the country into crises before the Olympic Games, which are due to be half in Beijing this Summer.
SNT.102789.9185	The official newspaper of the government of China claimed that "the Dalai Lama is scheming to take the Beijing Olympics hostage to force the Chinese government to make concessions to Tibet independence."
SNT.102789.9186	This move comes after Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, vowed to step down from his position if things "get out of control" in Tibet, where violent demonstrations against China have killed anywhere from 13 to 100 people.
SNT.102789.9187	The protests, which began in Lhasa, have since spread to neighboring provinces.
SNT.102789.9188	"Earlier today, the whole town was teeming with police and soldiers," he said.

SNT.102789.9191	The international community has repeatedly urged China to use restraint in dealing with protesters, and to start talks with the Dalai Lama.
SNT.102789.9192	United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Monday, "We have really urged the Chinese over several years to find a way to talk with the Dalai Lama, who is a figure of authority, who is not a separatist, and to find a way to engage him and bring his moral weight to a more sustainable and better solution of the Tibet issue."
SNT.115617.9193	Djibouti and Eritrea have spoken to the United Nations security council on Thursday to discuss a border dispute.
SNT.115617.9194	Djibouti has said that unless the UN intervenes there will be war.
SNT.115617.9195	The dispute dates back to June when violence erupted between the nations in the border region of Doumeira.
SNT.115617.9196	The unmarked border remains disputed, and the nations have built up troops on each side of the border, keeping the situation tense.
SNT.115617.9197	Djibouti's ambassador to the UN, Roble Olhaye, has accused Eritrea of avoiding mediation on the problem.
SNT.115617.9198	Djibouti's President Omah Guelleh told the UN security council "Continued inaction in whatever form not only will encourage but will benefit Eritrea's attitude."
SNT.115617.9199	"This would only give my country one option, the option of war."
SNT.115617.9200	The Eritrean ambassador to the UN, Araya Desta, claimed to have peaceful intentions and that his nation had no wishes to take new territory.
SNT.115617.9201	He claimed his country desired "the cultivation of good neighbourly relations with Djibouti," and said that "Contrary to the claims made, Eritrea has not taken any land that belongs to Djibouti and it does not have any territorial ambitions."
SNT.115617.9202	Desta accused Ethiopia of worsening the situation by preparing military forces to help Djibouti.
SNT.115617.9203	"Ethiopia has built from the Djiboutian side a network of winding roads up the mount and deployed offensive long-range artillery and heavy equipment directed at Eritrea," he said.
SNT.115617.9204	Olhaye dismissed the idea of Ethiopia's involvement with the claim "Whatever the Eritrean ambassador has said is hogwash."
SNT.115617.9205	The UN security council has urged both nations to show restraint; it was the UN who called on the nations to agree to a ceasefire in June.
SNT.246010.9206	Veteran striker Pat "Bam Bam" Healy put an end to the undefeated streak of Lyle "Fancy Pants" Beerbohm in a close main event fight that went to the judges' decision at the Strikeforce Challengers 14 event at Cedar Park Center in Cedar Park, Texas on Friday night.
SNT.246010.9207	Veteran fighter Carlo "Neo" Prater also prevailed in his Strikeforce debut against Bryan Travers.
SNT.246010.9208	Ryan Couture, son of MMA legend Randy Couture, remained undefeated in his second-ever bout.
SNT.246010.9209	Lyle Beerbohm came into the main event bout with an undefeated 15-0-0 record, in addition to his 8-0-0 amateur record.
SNT.246010.9210	"This is going to be a fun, tough, hard fight that I expect will go everywhere," stated Beerbohm in a pre-fight media workout on Wednesday.
SNT.246010.9211	"My time has come and I am really looking forward to the fight."
SNT.246010.9212	Beerbohm also stated he wanted to eventually fight for a Strikeforce Lightweight title, but recognized that he first needed to move past his veteran opponent, Pat Healey, who came into the fight with a record of 25-17-0, who was making his return to action since his loss to Josh Thompson via submission in 2010.
SNT.246010.9213	The bout was very close, going the distance through all three rounds.
SNT.246010.9214	While Beerbohm pushed a lot of the action, especially with grappling on the ground, Healey was able to land more effective strikes and weathered persistent take-down attempts from Beerbohm.
SNT.246010.9215	The action was back-and-forth, neither fighter never able to clearly dominate the other.
SNT.246010.9216	The last few minutes of the fight proved to be the best for Healey, who wore down Beerbohm's strength and left him gasping for air, allowing Healey to attempt more submissions on the ground.
SNT.246010.9217	The three judges scored the bout 29-28, 29-28, and 29-28 to give Healey the unanimous decision win.
SNT.246010.9218	After the match, Beerbohm was upbeat, but felt he had won the bout.
SNT.246010.9219	"I thought going into the third we'd each won a round, but I definitely thought I won that last round."
SNT.246010.9220	"But that's what happens when you let it go to the hands of the judges."
SNT.246010.9221	Healey complimented his opponent, "Beerbohm fought a good fight but I think I outworked and outhustled him."
SNT.246010.9222	Healey also welcomed the idea of a rematch, stating, "He talked a lot of trash, but if he wants a rematch, I'll give him one anytime."
SNT.246010.9223	Asked who he wanted to face next, Healey stated he wanted to fight the winner of the Billy "Cyborg" Evangelista and Jorge "Gamebred" Masvidal on March 5, noting that both fighters had previously defeated his brother, Pat Healey.
SNT.246010.9224	The co-main event for the show featured Carlo "Neo" Prater, a veteran fighter with a 25-10-1 record making his Strikeforce debut against the 14-3-0 Bryan Travers.
SNT.246010.9225	The bout was over in just 38 seconds as Prater used his superior reach to jab Travers several times before using a trip to take Travers to the ground and submitting him with an Anaconda Choke.
SNT.246010.9226	Prater showed a lot of emotion in his post-fight interview.
SNT.246010.9227	"My record shows I'm not a perfect fighter, but when you're down you get up," Prater said.
SNT.246010.9228	"This was a good win, I'll get better off this fight, but I'll be right back in the gym soon."
SNT.246010.9229	Ryan Couture, the son of MMA legend Randy "the Nature" Couture, pushed his fight record to 2-0-0 with a victory over 2-0-0 opponent Lee Higgins.
SNT.246010.9230	Most of the first round featured very little action until Higgins attempted to take down Couture, and found himself fighting off Guillotine Choke and a D'Arce Choke in the last minute of the round.
SNT.246010.9231	Couture dominated nearly all of the second round with superior stand-up striking and ground control.
SNT.246010.9232	Higgins fared little better in the third, as Couture was able to put Higgins against the cage and stop Higgins' take-down attempts, and then eventually control Higgins on the ground before submitting him with a Rear Naked Choke with 20 seconds left in the bout.
SNT.246010.9233	The main card was broadcast in the United States on premium broadcast network Showtime.
SNT.246010.9234	The Showtime Strikeforce Challengers series highlights mixed martial arts fights between up-and-coming fighters as well as veteran fighters who are looking to move up towards the larger Strikeforce events.
SNT.43904.9235	Mauritanians voted in favour of a new Constitution by an overwhelming majority in a referendum held on June 26, according to results announced by Interior Ministry officials today.
SNT.43904.9236	The new Constitution sets limits on the number of presidential terms a leader can serve, in contrast to several sub-Saharan countries, where several leaders have amended their Constitutions to retain power.
SNT.43904.9237	The Interior Minister, Mohamed Ahmed Ould Mohamed Lemine said that over 96 percent votes cast were in favour of the new Constitution.
SNT.43904.9238	The turnout was over 76 percent of the close to One million registered voters, who constitute about a third of the country's population.
SNT.43904.9239	The referendum will now lead to municipal and legislative elections to be held in November, followed by elections to the parliamentary upper house and the President's post in 2007.
SNT.43904.9240	The new Constitution provides for a presidential form of government, with the President commanding significant powers, including the appointment of the prime minister.
SNT.43904.9241	The Parliament though, can vote for no confidence in the government or censure it.
SNT.43904.9242	The Constitution disallows members of the present junta from running for the President's post and requires future leaders to swear on the Qur'an that they will not amend the Constitution to stay in power.
SNT.43904.9243	International observers from the African Union and the Arab League said that the referendum appeared to have gone smoothly, but have yet to make their final reports.
SNT.43904.9244	President Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, who also voted in the referendum said, "This is a great day and a rebirth for Mauritania ..."
SNT.43904.9245	"I am sure that all Mauritanians feel the same way and that for this reason the Constitution will receive massive support."
SNT.43904.9247	The Constitution has the backing of most civic and political groups, though two small parties called for a boycott of the referendum, saying the proposed Constitution ignores slavery, which is officially banned but still persists according to activists; and issues of "cohabitation between the different national communities" (such as Blacks and Arabs).
SNT.28615.9248	An Australian man arrested last December near the Cambodian border in Vietnam, Trinh Huu, has been sentenced to death by a Vietnamese People's Court for smuggling 2kg of heroin.
SNT.28615.9249	Amnesty International has urged the Australian Federal Government to do everything it can to help the man.
SNT.28615.9250	The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs has said that Trinh was receiving consular assistance, but that it was too early to negotiate for clemency as his case is still subject to appeal.
SNT.28615.9251	The government has reiterated its long standing opposition to the death penalty.
SNT.169326.9252	According to reports, multiple Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have injured three children, including one infant.
SNT.169326.9253	According to a reporter for Al Jazeera, at least six locations were attacked by the strikes; meanwhile, Palestinian sources told the BBC that there were a total of at least thirteen strikes.
SNT.169326.9254	A correspondent for the BBC reported that the attacks were the most serious in the area in over a year.
SNT.169326.9255	Israel's military commented that it was targeting weapon storage areas in the centre of the Gaza Strip, and that their move was a reaction to rockets fired from Gaza.
SNT.169326.9256	"Israel will not tolerate terroristic activity inside Gaza that threatens Israeli citizens," read a statement by the armed forces.
SNT.169326.9257	According to Palestinian news agencies, Israeli aircraft threw leaflets around areas of Gaza yesterday, cautioning people that there would be retaliation for clashes near Khan Yunis last week, which killed two Israeli troops.
SNT.169326.9258	Hamas officials and witnesses reported that farms, a milk factory, small areas belonging to the Hamas military, and metal workshop facilities were targeted.
SNT.14335.9259	MSNBC translator Jacob Keryakes has stated that the claim of responsibility for the London bombings of July 7, supposedly made by a militant Islamist group, contains an error in one of the Quranic verses that it cites, suggesting that the claim may be phony.
SNT.14335.9260	The claim of responsibility by The Secret Organization of al-Qaida in Europe for the London attacks has also been questioned on the grounds that the rhetoric is not consistent with militant Islamic ideology.
SNT.14335.9261	The statement asked "the Nation of Islam and the Nation of Arabism to rejoice" about the attacks.
SNT.14335.9262	According to the Associated Press, Islamic expert Mishari al-Thaidi wrote in an essay published Saturday in the London-based Arabic Asharq Al Awsat newspaper: "What strikes attention here is addressing the Arab nation."

SNT.7284.9267	U.S. media giant Time Warner plans to increase the international reach of its HBO television empire with an expansion of television offerings in Asia.
SNT.7284.9268	The channels will be available via both wired cable services and by satellite, which is more popular in Asia than it is in the United States.
SNT.7284.9269	"Cable operators throughout Asia are preparing to dramatically expand channel capacity on many of their systems through digital technology," Jonathan Spink, CEO of HBO Asia said in a World Screen News report.
SNT.7284.9270	He said HBO plans to be one of the first programmers to take advantage of increased channel capacity.
SNT.7284.9271	The first new channel HBO plans to launch in Asia is HBO Signature, which is targeted to women.
SNT.7284.9272	It is planned to debut in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau and Sri Lanka by the end of the year.
SNT.7284.9273	According to reports, HBO already has struck deals for carriage in all of those countries except Macau.
SNT.7284.9274	In addition to programming HBO Signature to women, the company said it plans on two other genre-based channels, but did not disclose what niches they would market toward.
SNT.7284.9275	A clue could be to look to the U.S. where HBO's niche channels include HBO Family for children-friendly programming and the self-explanatory HBO Comedy channel.
SNT.7284.9276	Like the parent HBO Asia channel, along with limited original programming, the new genre channels are expected to offer top Hollywood fare dubbed into local languages.
SNT.7284.9277	This is the largest expansion of HBO Asia, which has been operating in Asia since 1992 and serves 25 countries, since the launch of Cinemax Asia in 1996.
SNT.171476.9278	British Airways (BA) and the Spanish airline Iberia have signed a merger deal, which will create one of the largest air carrier groups in the world.
SNT.171476.9279	The two announced the merger yesterday, and said that the deal, which has been expected for a long time, is to be implemented by the end of 2010.
SNT.171476.9280	The move will make a group with a market value of US$8 billion.
SNT.171476.9281	Under the plan, both companies keep their own brands and operations, but will be owned by International Airlines Group, a new holding company.
SNT.171476.9282	It will be listed in London, but taxed in Spain.
SNT.171476.9283	The airlines believe the merger will save $530 million annually.
SNT.171476.9284	In February, BA reported a loss of $102.4 million for the final three quarters of 2009, whilst Iberia posted an operating loss of $629 million.
SNT.171476.9285	Meanwhile, investors in BA will receive an IAG share for every BA share they own, and stockholders in Iberia 1.0205 shares for each share in the Spanish airline; thus, BA shareholders will take 55% of IAG.
SNT.171476.9286	"The merged company will provide customers with a larger combined network," commented BA chief executive Willie Walsh.
SNT.171476.9287	"It will also have greater potential for further growth by optimising the dual hubs of London and Madrid and providing continued investment in new products and services."
SNT.171476.9288	Meanwhile, Iberia chief executive Antonio Vázquez remarked: "This is an important step in creating one of the world's leading global airlines that will be better equipped to compete with other major airlines and participate in future industry consolidation."
SNT.171476.9289	Independent aviation specialist James Halstead said he believed the merger was necessary for BA to remain competitive amongst other European air carriers.
SNT.171476.9290	"BA's unique position at Heathrow could help it survive for a short while, but in the long run it needs more than just Heathrow."
SNT.171476.9291	"The main point of the Iberia deal is to be able to cut costs and put the combined company in the position that Air France-KLM and Lufthansa are already in," he said, quoted by The Independent.
SNT.497600.9292	Artistic gymnastics events at the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games concluded yesterday with two gold medal wins for China and gold medals for the Netherlands and the United States.
SNT.497600.9293	China's Feng Zhe won gold in the men's parallel bars, just narrowly beating out the German gymnast Marcel Nguyen by 0.166 points.
SNT.497600.9294	China also claimed a gold with Deng Linlin scoring a 15.600 in the women's beam.
SNT.497600.9295	The balance beam proved treacherous for some: Gabrielle Douglas, considered a favourite for the event, came seventh after a dramatic fall.
SNT.497600.9296	The United States did manage to get a bronze on the beam thanks to Alexandra Raisman who pulled off a routine that received enormous applause.
SNT.497600.9297	She initially got less points than Romania's Catalina Ponor, but took the bronze after an appeal.
SNT.497600.9298	The men's horizontal bar event was a volley of high-scoring, high-difficulty routines.
SNT.497600.9299	Danell Leyva from the United States started with a strong 15.833 point routine.
SNT.497600.9300	China's Zhang Chenglong then grabbed the lead by earning 16.266 points.
SNT.497600.9301	The German gymnast Fabian Hambuchen raised the bar even further with a 16.400 routine.
SNT.497600.9302	The Dutch gymnast Epke Zonderland performed a near-flawless and immensely difficult routine that earned 16.533 points, earning him both a gold medal and a standing ovation from the audience in the North Greenwich Arena.
SNT.497600.9303	Zonderland's performance makes him the first Dutch gymnast to win gold at the Olympics since the win for the Dutch women's team at the Amsterdam Games in 1928.
SNT.497600.9304	Hambuchen got a silver medal and the Chinese gymnast Zou Kai took bronze.
SNT.497600.9305	In the women's floor event, the eighteen-year-old United States gymnast Alexandra Raisman secured a second gold after her success in the women's team event last week.
SNT.497600.9306	As in the beam event, she narrowly beat out Catalina Ponor from Romania with a score of 15.600 to 15.200.
SNT.497600.9307	Aliya Mustafina from Russia took home bronze for her 14.900 point routine.

SNT.17187.9309	The arrest has been confirmed by the Italian Minister of the Interior.
SNT.17187.9310	Hussein is a UK citizen who was born in Somalia, and later moved to Britain and naturalized.

SNT.145523.9313	The Wiltshire town beat 24 others in a competition to become the first ever to be twinned with the famous resort.
SNT.145523.9314	Rebecca Warren, a local building society worker, created a poem and video praising Swindon which won over the judges.
SNT.145523.9315	Among other features she highlighted the town's well-known Magic Roundabout, a complicated junction composed of five interlinked mini-roundabouts, comparing it to Disney World's teacup rides.
SNT.145523.9316	A sign marking the twinning is planned for the roundabout.
SNT.145523.9317	Ms. Warren will travel to Florida with her eleven-year-old nephew and five-year-old niece to unveil a similar sign at the resort.
SNT.145523.9318	A celebration will be held in Swindon in January, and it will also be the focus of an exhibit at Walt Disney World's Epcot park.
SNT.145523.9319	"Britain clearly has a love for Walt Disney World and long-standing affinity with the parks and their magic, which is probably why the number and quality of entries received was so high," said Disney's Hugh Wood.
SNT.145523.9320	Other towns shortlisted in the competition included Aberdeen, Blackpool, Milton Keynes, and Cambridge.
SNT.81472.9321	The jury in the Isiah Thomas sexual harassment trial revealed a guilty verdict Tuesday, ruling that the current New York Knicks coach subjected former Madison Square Garden executive Anucha Browne Sanders to unwanted sexual advances and verbal insults.
SNT.81472.9322	In a minor victory for Thomas, the ruling also said that Thomas will not have to pay punitive damages.
SNT.81472.9323	However, Thomas' employer, Madison Square Garden, was also found guilty of harassment and will have to pay millions dollars worth of punitive damages to Browne Sanders.
SNT.81472.9324	The ugly three-week trial originated with a US$10 million lawsuit filed by Browne Sanders, the former senior vice president of marketing and business operations for the Knicks.
SNT.81472.9325	She was fired by the team in December of 2006, and following her dismissal she filed the explosive lawsuit alleging that Madison Square Garden fostered an environment of sexism and inequality, personified by the conduct of Isiah Thomas.
SNT.81472.9326	She stated that Thomas repeatedly called her a "bitch" and a "ho", and pressured her to kiss him and said that he loved her.
SNT.81472.9327	She also stated that the firing was the result of her filing a complaint about Thomas.
SNT.81472.9328	Madison Square Garden, and the coach known for his charismatic and emotional demeanor, denied the charges.
SNT.81472.9329	After the guilty verdict was read, a relieved Browne Sanders hugged her family and friends who were present at the trial.
SNT.81472.9330	Thomas met with his lawyers, and while leaving the courthouse stated, "I'm innocent, very innocent, and I did not do the things she has accused me in this courtroom of doing."
SNT.81472.9331	"I'm extremely disappointed that the jury did not see the facts in this case."
SNT.81472.9332	"I will appeal this, and I remain confident in the man that I am and what I stand for and the family that I have."
SNT.81472.9333	Madison Square Garden is also expected to appeal the decision.

SNT.16889.9346	President Bush is lobbying the U.S. House of Representatives to pass the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which is scheduled for a vote Wednesday night.
SNT.16889.9347	Similar to the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, CAFTA would create a free trade zone putting an end to most trade barriers between the United States and six additional countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.
SNT.16889.9348	Many Republicans who represent agricultural Corn Belt or industrial Rust Belt and southern textile states in Congress also have stated opposition to the bill.
SNT.16889.9349	But with a Republican majority in the House large enough to ensure passage of CAFTA, party leaders are trying to shore up enough votes to ensure CAFTA's passage.
SNT.16889.9350	This has prompted last minute action by the President to lobby individual members of the House, reminding them that Central American countries have committed troops and other resources to fight the U.S. War on Terror.
SNT.16889.9351	Other Republican leaders have been using the party's traditional pro-business message and linking it to homeland security issues.

SNT.62598.9362	The New Zealand Police have issued a warning to state broadcaster TVNZ (Television New Zealand) for not telling them that they knew where a rapist on the run from police was.
SNT.62598.9363	However, he did turn himself in after giving the interview.
SNT.62598.9364	John Clarke, the convicted rapist, was on the run from police after leaving his home while he was on home detention on Monday, and two probation officers were also present.
SNT.62598.9365	One News, owned by TVNZ, were interviewing John Clarke yesterday, meanwhile a lot of time and effort from police was going into trying to hunt him down.
SNT.62598.9366	After they have finished the interview, Mr Clarke handed himself in to the Greymouth police, which One News also recorded.
SNT.62598.9367	"He wandered in off the street with a TV film crew," said Greymouth Sergeant David Cross.
SNT.62598.9368	A spokeswoman for TVNZ, Megan Williams said that they would only agree to the interview with Mr Clarke if he handed himself into police after they had finished.
SNT.62598.9369	She said that if he had not handed himself in, they would then have gone to the police.
SNT.62598.9370	The police say that they would have expected TVNZ to have called them "...to say 'look Gary, perhaps if you pull back some of your resources at 5 o'clock, this guy's going to give himself up'," said Sergeant Cross.
SNT.62598.9371	Sergeant Alison Eleam, Christchurch's central area commander, says that she is not impressed with the way TVNZ acted.
SNT.62598.9372	TVNZ say that they are now happy to talk to the police.

SNT.88707.9382	"Ben was a good guy, a funny fellow and I will never forget him."
SNT.88707.9383	"For one, I can't even imagine how thrilled I was when he took off his own personal, extremely limited Cranial Impalement (early band demo) long-sleeve and threw it my way, saying, 'Hey bro, it's yours.'"
SNT.88707.9384	"This is just one of many perfect examples that showed what kind of humble person Ben was."
SNT.88707.9385	"My condolences go out to friends, family and band members."
SNT.504780.9386	London, England— Australia lost Sunday night to Canada 50–57 in the women's wheelchair basketball at the Olympic Park in London.
SNT.504780.9387	Poor shooting doomed the Australian Gliders' hopes of a third victory in a row at the Basketball Arena; they only managed to make only 23 out of 68 shots at the basket, a miserable 34%.

SNT.66363.9411	A camera set up in the jungles of Malaysian Borneo in Sabah by the World Wide Fund for Nature or WWF, has captured, for the first time, a Borneo Rhino on videotape.
SNT.66363.9412	"This astonishing footage captures one of the world's most elusive creatures."
SNT.66363.9413	"Tremendous progress has been made in recent years to secure the rhino's habitat but so much more needs to be done considering this species may very well disappear in the next 10 years," said President and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund in a press release, Carter Roberts.
SNT.66363.9414	"In the video, the rhino comes out of the jungle brush and then proceeds to sniff the camera and equipment surrounding it."
SNT.66363.9415	"The video also shows the rhino getting a bite to eat."
SNT.66363.9416	It is estimated that there are only 25 to 50 of the rhinos alive on the planet, and they can only be found in the jungles of Sabah, or better known as the "Heart of Borneo."
SNT.66363.9417	For the past 20 years, the rhino has not been reported anywhere else in Sabah and researchers say that it is likely "extinct" in the rest of Malaysia.
SNT.66363.9418	Researchers say that poaching to use the rhino's horn in medicine and encroachment into their habitats are causing them to decline.
SNT.66363.9419	Researchers also say that because the rhino is so isolated from the rest of Malaysia, that they are rarely able to breed together.
SNT.66363.9420	"The rhino is very sensitive to the presence of human beings."
SNT.66363.9421	"Till now, we can still see the rhino, but if we cannot develop any kind of protection method, I think the rhinos will survive less than 10 years," said a project manager for the WWF for elephants and rhinos in the Borneo region, Raymond Alfred.
SNT.66363.9422	In 2006, the first ever still image was captured of the rhino.
SNT.102602.9423	Just hours after firing two contract employees and disciplining a third for inappropriately examining the passport file of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told Sen. Hillary Clinton that her passport file was also breached in 2007.
SNT.102602.9424	Sen. John McCain, the Republican candidate for president, also had his file breached — this time by one of the same individuals who had examined Obama's records.
SNT.102602.9425	Both Clinton and McCain were informed that their files were improperly accessed, according to their Senate offices, after Rice called to apologize to Barack Obama for the incident hours before.
SNT.102602.9426	"I told him I was sorry and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if anyone had looked at my passport file and that, therefore, I will stay on top of this," Rice said.
SNT.102602.9427	"We are going to do an investigation through the inspector general."
SNT.102602.9428	"None of us want us to have a situation where any American's passport file is accessed in an unauthorized way."
SNT.102602.9429	According to Assistant Secretary of State, Sean McCormack, at least one breach occurred during a training session, with a contract employee brought in to deal with a large backlog of passport applications.
SNT.102602.9430	"We do feel that the system worked, but the system isn't perfect," McCormack said.
SNT.102602.9431	Obama's response to the incident was "One of the things that the American people count on in their interactions with any level of government is that if they have to disclose personal information, then it is going to stay personal and stay private."
SNT.102602.9432	He also told reporters he expects a full and thorough congressional investigation.
SNT.102602.9433	McCain, who was in France after recently traveling to Iraq responded to the incident stating, "The United States of America values everyone's privacy and corrective action should be taken."
SNT.46870.9434	In testimony given before a U.S. military hearing, criminal investigator Benjamin Bierce narrated his account of how an incident involving five soldiers involved the serial rape of a 14-year-old Iraqi girl prior to shooting her.
SNT.46870.9435	The hearing will determine whether four current U.S. soldiers have to face a court martial hearing; an additional former soldier allegedly involved in the incident, Steven D. Green, was recently discharged from the military and has pleaded not guilty to rape and murder charges in federal court in Kentucky.
SNT.46870.9436	According to Bierce, a U.S. Special Agent investigating the incident, the brutal attack which saw Abeer Qassim al-Janabi slain and her parents and younger sister murdered was premeditated.
SNT.46870.9437	Citing a sworn statement from Army Specialist James Barker, the five accused were said to have plotted the rape whilst drinking whisky and playing cards.
SNT.46870.9438	According to Agent Bierce, Spc. Barker said that Pte. Spielman grabbed the girl while Pte. Green seized her father and they then took them into the house and Sgt. Cortez and Spc. Barker followed them inside.
SNT.46870.9439	Pte. Green supposedly led the father, mother and younger sister into the bedroom and closed the door, while the teenage girl remained in the living room with the other Americans, Spc. Barker's statement said.
SNT.46870.9440	Cortez then allegedly pushed the girl to the floor, pulled up her dress and tore off her underwear while she was struggling, Bierce said, again citing Spc. Barker's statement.
SNT.46870.9441	Cortez appeared to then rape Abeer and afterward, Spc. Barker tried to rape the girl, the statement said.
SNT.46870.9442	Then Pte. Green came out of the bedroom with an AK-47 rifle and announced: "They're all dead."
SNT.46870.9443	Cortez held Abeer down while Pte. Green raped the girl; according to Spc. Barker's statement.
SNT.46870.9444	Pte. Green then picked up the AK-47 and shot Abeer once, waited, and then shot her a few more times, the U.S. official, Agent Bierce, said, quoting from Spc. Barker's statement.
SNT.46870.9445	Spc. Barker said that he then poured kerosene lamp fuel on the girl's body but Barker did not say who set it on fire.
SNT.46870.9446	Gary Griesmyer, another Special Agent, quoted Sgt. Cortez as telling him that the teenage girl was crying and talking in Arabic and that Spc. Barker told her to "shut up."
SNT.46870.9447	Private Justin Watt testified that Pte. Howard told him before the incident that Pte. Green, Sgt. Cortez and Spc. Barker were planning to rape a girl, and Pte. Howard was going to be the lookout.
SNT.46870.9449	Watt testified that he heard Mr. Green say, "I want to kill and hurt a lot of Iraqis."
SNT.46870.9450	Green has been discharged from the military and has pleaded not guilty in a federal court in Kentucky where he will stand trial; he will not be facing a court martial regardless of what occurrs in the Baghdad hearing.
SNT.46870.9451	"If you have the power to make something right, you should do it."
SNT.46870.9452	"But if something went down -- something terrible like that -- then it's my obligation to come forward," Watt said.
SNT.46870.9453	Watt also said life for some of the soldiers in the B Company, 1st Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, was horrible while they were manning a military post in nearby Yusufiyah.
SNT.46870.9454	Some lived in a "dilapidated, abandoned water treatment facility" he said.
SNT.46870.9455	Pfc. Watt, who is identified as the whistle-blowing soldier who disclosed the attack during a counseling session, also said; "I feared for my safety at the TCP (traffic control point)."
SNT.46870.9456	"It's like this, I find out that guys in my squad, guys I trusted with my life, are allegedly responsible for one of the most brutal rapes/murders I've ever seen."
SNT.46870.9457	Pfc. Justin Cross testified that deadly attacks by insurgents sapped morale and raised combat stress in the U.S. Army unit that included the soldiers accused of raping and murdering Abeer.
SNT.46870.9458	He said that the "mentally draining" living conditions of the combat unit was a factor.
SNT.46870.9459	"You feel like every step you might get blown up."
SNT.46870.9460	"You just hit a point where you're like, 'If I die today, I die.'"
SNT.46870.9461	An article 32 hearing, like this, seeks to determine if a soldiers should face court martial.
SNT.46870.9462	Its similar to that of a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding in civilian law.
SNT.56772.9463	Two men were arrested today by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) at a Caledonia rally at about 12:00 p.m. ET after entering the disputed land in Caledonia, Ontario waving Canadian flags.
SNT.56772.9464	One was Gary McHale, a Richmond Hill, Ontario man who entered the occupied land in Caledonia, Ontario to organize a rally against the ongoing aboriginal occupation.
SNT.56772.9465	Vandermaas was forced to the ground by police officers, who ripped the flag out of his hand when he crossed the police line.
SNT.56772.9466	According to news reports, McHale intended to put the Canadian flag across the street from DCE (Douglas Creek Estates) where the aboriginal occupation has been ongoing for 10 months.
SNT.56772.9467	Back in late October the aboriginals had already put up their flags across from the DCE property and the OPP made no attempt to stop them.
SNT.56772.9468	However, on Dec. 2 residents of Caledonia attempted to put up Canadian flags with Yellow ribbons in various areas in Caledonia.
SNT.56772.9469	When they tried to put up a Canadian Flag across from DCE property the OPP sent in 100 officers to stop them.
SNT.56772.9470	Mr. McHale called for people to gather on Dec. 16 to try to put up Canadian Flags across from DCE property on the same hydro poles that Natives already had put up their flags.
SNT.56772.9471	Mr. McHale stated, "I have asked 2 dozen OPP officers why it is legal to have a Native Flag up along the highway but illegal for a Canadian Flag to be up and I have never received an answer."
SNT.56772.9472	"The OPP set up a line just about a hundred yards away from that site and several people were able to cross that line."
SNT.56772.9473	"They got through a farmer's field on far left side of where I'm standing here," said CTV reporter Joel Bowey.
SNT.56772.9474	"We're hearing that Mr. McHale got in the middle of the street and put a flag down there, and that's when he and the other man from London, Ont. were arrested."
SNT.56772.9475	"So far all we know is that those two men have been arrested and there are no other arrests at this point."
SNT.56772.9476	The OPP said the men were arrested for "breaking the peace" and noted that it is not a criminal offence.
SNT.56772.9477	Police had warned them about crossing into the disputed land before.
SNT.56772.9478	"I've now said that Mr. McHale's plans were counterproductive and potentially dangerous to what we've been trying to do there, and that is to reach a peaceful settlement," said David Ramsay, Ontario's minister of aboriginal affairs.
SNT.56772.9479	"I've twice now offered Mr. McHale the opportunity to protest at Queen's Park [the site of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario building]."
SNT.56772.9480	"In fact, I said I would sponsor his rally and set up a platform and a microphone, a PA system for him."
SNT.56772.9481	Mayor Marie Trainer of Haldimand County, were Caledonia is located, said: "The next meeting or two will be wasted on frivolous stuff again instead of getting down to business."
SNT.56772.9482	Trainer also says that he should not be entering the town and did not specify what side she is on or if she is not taking any side.
SNT.56772.9483	This was not the first time Gary McHale entered the disputed land.
SNT.56772.9484	On October 15, 2006, McHale with approximately 2000 (as reported by local newspapers) participants rallied in Caledonia, but the OPP blocked the entrance to the occupied site.
SNT.56772.9485	"Our fight is not with the natives, we're just trying to be equal in a democratic Canada," said Christine McHale, wife of Gary McHale.
SNT.56772.9486	"When a native commits a serious crime or any crime, they stand by and watch the crime take place and will not do anything to stop the crime."
SNT.56772.9487	"When a resident does the simplest thing, even putting up a Canadian flag or drinking a coffee in a lawn chair across some magic line, they will send in scores of officers to arrest the person," said Gary McHale.
SNT.56772.9488	"We have to take a stand and say to police forces that there is one set of laws for all citizens."
SNT.56772.9489	"Police have one set of policies for natives and another set of policies for non-natives," he said before the rally.
SNT.56772.9490	"It's against our Charter of Rights, that clearly says there's not to be any discriminations based on their religion, beliefs, race or their skin colour."
SNT.56772.9491	McHale has been long critical of the Ontario Provincial Police over the land claim saying that they treat aboriginals differently.
SNT.56772.9492	McHale and his wife operate a website called Caledonia Wake Up Call.com, were they detail what they describe as police bias.
SNT.81859.9493	France have defeated New Zealand 18-20 in the quarter-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, Wales.
SNT.81859.9494	New Zealand led 13-3 at half time, after Dan Carter kicked two penalties and Luke McAlister scored a try.
SNT.81859.9495	France missed chances to score with Lionel Beauxis and Jean-Baptiste Élissalde both missing penalties and Damien Traille missing a drop goal attempt.
SNT.81859.9496	Lionel Beauxis scored France's first points with a penalty just before half time.
SNT.81859.9497	However, New Zealand centre Luke McAlister was harshly sin-binned early in the second half for illegally blocking a French player and preventing a try scoring opportunity.
SNT.81859.9498	France took advantage of having the extra man, and levelled to 13-13 by the time the 10 minute suspension had elapsed with Lionel Beauxis adding a penalty and Thierry Dusautoir scoring a try.
SNT.81859.9499	The teams slogged it out for 15 minutes, but New Zealand could not make a breakthrough.
SNT.81859.9500	Luke McAlister missed a last minute drop goal attempt as France held on to win.
SNT.81859.9501	Some New Zealand fans blamed the loss on English referee Wayne Barnes due to alleged bias towards the French team.
SNT.81859.9502	Controversial decisions included Luke McAlister's sin binning and an apparent forward pass that led to France's second try, allowing them to take the lead.
SNT.81859.9503	However, most neutrals also noted an apparent forward pass in the build up to an earlier New Zealand try and consider Barnes to have done a reasonable job in such a high profile game.
SNT.81859.9504	France advance to the semi-final stage of the tournament and will play England, who defeated Australia 12-10 earlier today, in a repeat of the 2003 semi-final.
SNT.122075.9505	Raymond Lee Oyler of California, United States has been convicted of the murders of five US Forest Service firefighters killed while attempting to control a wildfire he had lit.
SNT.122075.9506	Oyler, 38, set the Esperanza Fire out of anger his dog had been impounded, according to prosecutors.
SNT.122075.9507	The October 2006 blaze destroyed 34 houses and 20 outbuildings, scorching over 17,400 hectares.
SNT.122075.9508	Prosecutors also alleged Oyler started the fire at night specifically to leave firefighters "on their own" without aerial support.
SNT.122075.9509	He was identified as the arsonist behind the fire after a security camera saw his car several times and samples taken from the scene matched those found in his girlfriend's house.
SNT.122075.9510	Oyler, an unemployed car mechanic, was also identified by the owner of a local petrol station as having stood in a car park and watched the fire's spread.
SNT.122075.9511	The five firefighters that were killed died when their truck was overrun by the flames.
SNT.122075.9512	Oyler was convicted of murdering them on Friday March 6 after a six-week trial in Riverside California.
SNT.122075.9513	The twelve-member jury took nearly a week of deliberation before returning the guilty verdict, and will meet to hear arguments regarding Oyler's sentence on Tuesday.
SNT.122075.9514	His defense had admitted Oyler likely started several fires in the Riverside County area, but denied he had started the one that killed the firefighters.

SNT.45017.9532	This appointment has been congratulated by the United Nations (UN) Secretary General, Kofi Annan.
SNT.45017.9533	Horta said the main priority for his government will be "restoring security and moving 150,000 people in refugee camps back home."
SNT.55658.9534	The Canadian House of Commons will re-open the debate on same-sex marriage next Wednesday, December 6th, when it debates a resolution to reconsider the Civil Marriage Act that was passed by the previous Liberal-led parliament in 2005.
SNT.55658.9535	In the intervening election, the victorious Conservatives promised that if they were elected parliament would hold a free vote on whether to amend or repeal the Act.
SNT.55658.9536	Several surveys have suggested that MPs in the minority parliament will overwhelmingly reaffirm support for same-sex marriage once a vote has held.
SNT.55658.9537	The pro-same sex marriage group Canadians for Equal Marriage estimates that the motion will be defeated by at least 35 votes.
SNT.55658.9538	This has prompted supporters of same-sex marriage to urge that a vote be held as soon as possible while opponents of gay marriage have been urging the government to delay the vote until the next election, expected early in 2007, in hopes of the election of a Conservative majority that would repeal the act.
SNT.55658.9539	A number of Conservative MPs and strategists have supported an early vote, however, in the belief that the same-sex issue would hurt the Tories in an election campaign by emphasizing a social conservative agenda that is unpopular in urban areas and Quebec.
SNT.65888.9540	Andrew Burris, from Curtis, Ohio, and member of Carpenters Local 1138, died in Toledo, Ohio when the construction platform he was on fell around 9:15 a.m. EST.
SNT.65888.9541	The platform was attached to the northbound side of the Veterans' Glass City Skyway, a new bridge on Interstate 280.
SNT.65888.9542	The platform was clamped to the side of the bridge, and broke off.
SNT.65888.9543	Burris fell about 95 feet to the ground, where he landed on the east side of the roadway.
SNT.65888.9544	Authorities from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration do not know why the platform broke free from the bridge.
SNT.65888.9545	The Toledo Police department does not suspect foul play, and considers the death to be accidental.
SNT.65888.9546	The $220 million bridge is scheduled for opening in June, 2007, and is the largest construction project in the history of Ohio.
SNT.65888.9547	"On behalf of Director Beasley and the Ohio Department of Transportation, we extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Andrew Burris," said ODOT District 2 director, Dave Dysard.
SNT.65888.9548	"We also extend our condolences to his relatives, friends and his fellow workers who have made us proud through their commitment and dedication to their work."
SNT.65888.9549	"Andrew was a part of the team that took the pylon to the top back in 2005."
SNT.65888.9550	"For four-and-a-half years, he was an integral part of the team that worked to complete this vital link for our community."
SNT.65888.9551	On Presidents' Day in 2004, five workers were killed and four were injured when a crane collapsed.
SNT.65888.9552	Mr. Burris was from a line of carpenters, and kept a scrapbook of the project.
SNT.65888.9553	His mother, Ruth, was quoted as saying "I think he felt closer to heaven there."
SNT.15962.9554	The British Parliament approved the first stage of the new Crossrail underground railroad through London as a £15 billion construction project earlier this month.
SNT.15962.9555	Crossrail is the first major new train line to be built in London in decades.
SNT.15962.9556	The rail line being implemented as a hybrid bill in Parliament.
SNT.15962.9557	After a second reading in Parliament, it was voted upon and decided that the government will commit to the project so that the line will be built.
SNT.15962.9558	The next issue before Parliament of to ensure that the implementation of the bill so it is consistent with private interests of neighborhoods to be affected by Crossrail.
SNT.15962.9559	This is when residents can petition Parliament to change the way the line is constructed.
SNT.15962.9560	As a result of construction of the Crossrail line, hundreds of homes will have new tunnels excavated beneath them.
SNT.15962.9561	On contacting Crossrail, they have indicated approximately £50 will be offered to each landowner to buy all the land rights-of-way to build the train tunnel more than 9 meters below the residential buildings.
SNT.15962.9562	The average value for properties in the affected areas is £350,000.
SNT.15962.9563	Under UK compulsory purchase laws to be used in this bill, the residents are entitled to the difference in the value of the whole property with and without a tunnel under it.
SNT.15962.9564	If the offer given by Crossrail is not accepted by any of the residents, the residents can take the case to the Land Tribunal, where the fair value will be established.
SNT.15962.9565	Crossrail does not indicate that it will attempt to assign a fair value in the original offer and instead is only going to offer around £50 per property in the hope that not many people take the matter to the Land Tribunal.
SNT.231311.9566	A Florida man was killed and another man hospitalized after their boat sank off Cape May, New Jersey, US.
SNT.231311.9567	The Sea Wolf sent a distress signal via emergency satellite beacon at about 1:35 AM on Thursday, seven miles off Cape May.
SNT.231311.9568	A member of the State Police informed the Coast Guard who sent out an MH-65 rescue helicopter and two rescue launches.
SNT.231311.9569	The helicopter managed to save Steve Hopkins of the District of Columbia but was unable to do the same for Gregory Arlotta of Florida.
SNT.231311.9570	The 62 year old disappeared among the debris in eight-foot waves.
SNT.231311.9571	Arlotta had recently bought the vessel in New York; its previous owner was in his seventies and had decided to sell the ship.
SNT.231311.9572	The Sea Wolf had been operating for a couple of decades prior to the sinking, and was described by one local as unfit for the voyage it was undertaking to New Orleans.
SNT.231311.9573	A 1963 Gilligan, it was designed for use within ten miles of shore for fishing.
SNT.129751.9574	Mark Webber set up a third place for Red Bull, while his team-mate Sebastian Vettel was out of the race due to problems with the car's suspension.
SNT.129751.9575	Nico Rosberg drove his Williams up to fourth place, while the second McLaren of Heikki Kovalainen came fifth.
SNT.129751.9576	Championship leader Jenson Button gained two points for Brawn by finishing 7th and is now 18.5 points ahead of Webber, who has moved into second place ahead of Vettel.
SNT.129751.9577	He split the two Toyota cars of Timo Glock and Jarno Trulli, who completed the top eight.
SNT.101585.9578	The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body that decides on the laws of the game, has decided to discontinue all experiments involving technology, and for the first time has also decided on the exact size of a soccer field.
SNT.101585.9579	Instead of pursuing the idea of using cameras or microchips in the ball to see if it has crossed the goal-line, the International Board wants to see if the introduction of two extra assistant referees can improve the quality of referee's decisions.
SNT.101585.9580	FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke declared: "We have decided to freeze for the time being the goal-line technology and all technology experiments."
SNT.101585.9581	"We will look on these two additional referees and we avoid considering any goal-line technology during this time."
SNT.101585.9582	FIFA President Sepp Blatter said the move was necessary to maintain the universal spirit of the game: "We have 260 million people directly involved in the game."
SNT.101585.9583	"If we maintain the laws of the game ... it's so easy to understand ..."
SNT.101585.9584	"We have to live with errors, football has to keep its human face."
SNT.101585.9585	"We have to maintain the laws of the game in their simplicity."
SNT.101585.9586	"Do you want technical devices to take decisions? That's why, after three years of tests with no conclusions, I am in favour of putting the whole thing on ice," Blatter explained.
SNT.101585.9587	UEFA president Michel Platini agreed: "Football should stay human, but two more officials can help, especially around the goal."
SNT.101585.9588	Platini made the suggestion to freeze all investigations into technology and to try two additional assistants behind each goal.
SNT.101585.9589	Blatter said the system using the microchip "was very complicated, needing electrified lines on the field of play and other devices including antennae and when we tested it in Tokyo last year there was one mistake during the seven matches we used as an experiment at the Club World Championship."
SNT.101585.9590	With regards to the system using cameras, he pointed to "problems with players obscuring the views of the cameras, or of flares or weather conditions."
SNT.101585.9591	The system of the extra referees will be tested at an upcoming FIFA or UEFA tournament, and a final ruling is expected at next year's meeting, according to FIFA's Jerome Valcke.
SNT.101585.9592	Hawk-Eye, the company that was working on the goal-line technology that is already being used for line calls in tennis, reacted with disappointment: "I'm livid, it is completely out of the blue..."
SNT.101585.9593	"A year ago they met and gave us four criteria to meet and we have met all of them, yet they have kicked it out now..."
SNT.101585.9594	"We have invested an awful lot of money and now we have no return on that investment," director Paul Hawkins said.
SNT.101585.9595	He said he was encouraged to continue research on the project only 10 days ago at a private showing for IFAB members at Reading's Madejski Stadium.
SNT.101585.9596	While the Welsh FA were also against the idea, the English Football Association supported the use of technology and was hoping to start using it by next season.
SNT.101585.9597	The FA clubs and referees supported the use of Hawk-Eye technology, said Mike Foster, general secretary of the English Premier League.
SNT.101585.9598	A spokesperson of the Premier League said that "A lot of time, money and effort has gone into developing a system that meets all the criteria laid down last year."
SNT.101585.9599	The Scottish and Northern Irish FA also voted in favour of the goal-line technology.
SNT.101585.9600	FA chief executive Brian Barwick expressed his disappointment at the annual meeting of the IFAB in Gleneagles, Scotland: "We were in favour of goal-line technology but there will be no more experiments and it will not be back on the agenda next year, or in the foreseeable future."
SNT.101585.9601	FIFA President Blatter denied ulterior motives for the decision: "There has been no change of heart."
SNT.101585.9602	"I have defended goal-line technology but it has become clear that such systems are too complicated and very costly."
SNT.101585.9603	"Nor would they necessarily add anything positive to the game and could harm the authority of the referee."
SNT.6792.9604	Johnnie Cochran, U.S. lawyer famous for getting O.J. Simpson acquitted of murder charges in the 1990s, died Tuesday afternoon in his home in Los Angeles, California.
SNT.6792.9605	He had been suffering from complications of an inoperable brain tumor.
SNT.6792.9606	"The family of Attorney Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr. and members of The Cochran Firm are deeply saddened by the passing," his family said in a statement to the press.
SNT.6792.9607	"The world has lost not only a legendary attorney, but an outstanding humanitarian."
SNT.129665.9608	Gidget, the chihuahua featured in the Taco Bell adverts in the United States has died from a stroke.
SNT.129665.9609	The dog died at the age of 15 on Tuesday night.
SNT.129665.9610	Sue Chipperton, the owner and trainer of Gidget commented saying, "She made so many people happy."
SNT.129665.9611	The dog was featured in the 1990s adverts that ran from 1997 to 2000.
SNT.129665.9612	Gidget was portrayed as a male dog and is remembered for the dubbed saying "Yo quiero Taco Bell" which is Spanish for "I want Taco Bell."
SNT.129665.9613	The advert was meant to be shown only once but was turned into a campaign.
SNT.129665.9614	Gidget was also featured in Legally Blonde 2 and adverts for the board game Trivial Pursuit.
SNT.18951.9615	Israeli soldiers are in the process of removing Jewish protesters from synagogues in Neve Dekalim and Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip as part of an operation to force the evacuation of settlements.
SNT.18951.9616	The settlement of Neve Dekalim was founded in 1983 and was home to 500 Orthodox Jewish families.
SNT.18951.9617	It also was occupied earlier before back in the 1940s, settled by a couple Jewish families who were able to hold off the Eygptian army.
SNT.18951.9618	Around 1,500 protesters inside the synagogue refused to leave despite warnings from the soldiers.
SNT.18951.9619	Many protesters have been retaliating to the soldiers' commands, and have even started shoving and punching a few guards.
SNT.18951.9620	The protesters have linked their arms in a chain to attempt to prevent themselves being removed.
SNT.18951.9621	The protesters are mostly not Gaza settlers, but are extremist youths from the West Bank and Israel.
SNT.18951.9622	After several hours of unsuccessful negotiations unarmed security forces entered the complex to begin removing people to buses waiting outside.
SNT.18951.9623	Those who did not go as instructed were usually escorted by two or three guards each to the buses.
SNT.18951.9624	Meanwhile, all male protesters have been removed from the building while the female protesters are still inside the synagogue.
SNT.18951.9625	In another Gaza town, Kfar Darom, protesters are also making their last stand in a synagogue, and thousands of troops have surrounded the buildings.
SNT.18951.9626	There, soldiers entered the synagogue as well and are dragging protesters out of the building.
SNT.18951.9627	They were, however, hampered by protesters on the roof, who, among other things, threw caustic soda at the soldiers.
SNT.18951.9628	Consequently, the rooftop was taken by security forces as well.
SNT.18951.9629	Seventy seven people have been injured, two moderately on the roof of the synagogue.
SNT.722550.9630	Researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital have created laboratory-grown rat kidneys that function when transplanted into rats according to a study published online yesterday in the medical journal Nature Medicine.
SNT.722550.9631	The kidneys were capable of urine production and excretion without blood clots in both the laboratory and inside living rats.
SNT.722550.9632	The researchers were able to create the functional kidneys by using a donor kidney and using a detergent to remove the rats' kidney cells, then used new cells to cause the kidney to grow around the remaining "scaffolding," the natural protein-based structure of the kidney that remained after washing the kidney.
SNT.722550.9633	These kidneys would also be of the patient's tissue avoiding issues of organ rejection and would increase the pool of kidneys available for human transplant.
SNT.722550.9634	The researchers incubated the kidneys in a specialized oven for 12 days to mimic the insides of a rat.
SNT.722550.9635	The researchers reported that these kidneys produced urine at 23% of the normal levels of properly working kidneys.
SNT.722550.9636	The lead researcher of the study published in Nature Medicine, Dr. Harald C. Ott, says this partial functionality is enough, saying, "If you're on haemodialysis then kidney function of 10% to 15% would already make you independent of hemodialysis."
SNT.722550.9637	"It's not that we have to go all the way."
SNT.722550.9638	The techniques developed by Ott and the team of researchers still have to be further researched before it can be applied for use in humans.
SNT.722550.9639	When it comes time for use in humans, Ott says that pigs' kidneys would be used as the templates for making human-usable kidneys.
SNT.722550.9640	Ott said, "You'd take a kidney matrix off the shelf."
SNT.722550.9641	"Then in an ideal world, you'd take cells from that patient and create a kidney on demand."
SNT.722550.9642	Roughly 100,000 patients in the United States need an immediate kidney transplant, with 500,000 more on dialysis.
SNT.36626.9643	In one of the most contentious Democratic primary races of the season, Iraqi war veteran Tammy Duckworth garnered 44% of the vote in the 6th Illinois congressional district, beating out Christine Cegalis (40%) and Lindy Scott (16%).
SNT.36626.9644	Duckworth's victory earns her a spot in the race against Republican state Senator Peter Roskam, who won the Republican nomination to replace retiring Congressman Henry Hyde.
SNT.36626.9645	Cegalis ran for the seat in 2004, garnering 44% of the vote, the best achieved by a Democrat against Hyde.
SNT.36626.9646	Working off of momentum gathered in that race, she continued to increase her grassroots organization and her Internet campaigning to gain support from Democrats across the nation.
SNT.36626.9647	Cegalis, a software engineer, was running unopposed for the nomination until Duckworth joined the race in December.
SNT.36626.9648	Supported by the Democratic establishment, Duckworth quickly out-fundraised her opponents, receiving support from prominent Democrats such as John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Rahm Emmanual, and Barack Obama.
SNT.36626.9649	The race became strongly contested between self-proclaimed progressive activists supporting Cegalis and Democrats who preferred to work with the party candidate.
SNT.36626.9650	Duckworth, who lost her legs in Iraq in 2004, received a strong showing of support from outside the district, including large fundraisers in New York and Chicago.
SNT.36626.9651	Scott, a former pastor of an evangelical church in Des Plains, attempted to paint the race in religious terms.
SNT.36626.9652	His campaign was run on the principle that he could win votes through his moderate, religious views, which he said would attract Republican voters in the district.
SNT.87701.9653	Wikinews reporter David Shankbone is currently, courtesy of the Israeli government and friends, visiting Israel.
SNT.87701.9654	This is a first-hand account of his experiences and may — as a result — not fully comply with Wikinews' neutrality policy.
SNT.87701.9655	Please note this is a journalism experiment for Wikinews and put constructive criticism on the collaboration page.
SNT.87701.9656	Dr. Yossi Vardi is known as Israel's 'Father of the Entrepreneur', and he has many children in the form of technology companies he has helped to incubate in Tel Aviv's booming Internet sector.
SNT.87701.9657	At the offices of Superna, one such company, he introduced a whirlwind of presentations from his baby incubators to a group of journalists.
SNT.87701.9658	What stuck most in my head was when Vardi said, "What is important is not the technology, but the talent."
SNT.87701.9659	Perhaps because he repeated this after each young Internet entrepreneur showed us his or her latest creation under Vardi's tutelage.
SNT.87701.9660	I had a sense of déjà vu from this mantra.
SNT.87701.9661	A casual reader of the newspapers during the Dot.com boom will remember a glut of stories that could be called "The Rise of the Failure"; people whose technology companies had collapsed were suddenly hot commodities to start up new companies.
SNT.87701.9662	This seemingly paradoxical thinking was talked about as new back then; but even Thomas Edison—the Father of Invention—is oft-quoted for saying, "I have not failed."
SNT.87701.9663	"I have just found ten thousand ways that won't work."
SNT.87701.9664	Vardi's focus on encouraging his brood of talent regardless of the practicalities stuck out to me because of a recent pair of "dueling studies" The New York Times has printed.
SNT.87701.9665	These are the sort of studies that confuse parents on how to raise their kids.
SNT.87701.9666	The first, by Carol Dweck at Stanford University, came to the conclusion that children who are not praised for their efforts, regardless of the outcome's success, rarely attempt more challenging and complex pursuits.
SNT.87701.9667	According to Dweck's study, when a child knows that they will receive praise for being right instead of for tackling difficult problems, even if they fail, they will simply elect to take on easy tasks in which they are assured of finding the solution.
SNT.87701.9668-1	Only one month earlier the Times produced another story for parents to agonize over, this time based on a study from the Brookings Institution, entitled "Are Kids Getting Too Much Praise?"
SNT.87701.9668-2	Unlike Dweck's clinical study, Brookings drew conclusions from statistical data that could be influenced by a variety of factors (since there was no clinical control).
SNT.87701.9669	The study found American kids are far more confident that they have done well than their Korean counterparts, even when the inverse is true.
SNT.87701.9670	The Times adds in the words of a Harvard faculty psychologist who intoned, "Self-esteem is based on real accomplishments."
SNT.87701.9671-1	"It's all about letting kids shine in a realistic way." 
SNT.87701.9671-2	But this is not the first time the self-esteem generation's proponents have been criticized.
SNT.87701.9672	Vardi clearly would find himself encouraged by Dweck's study, though, based upon how often he seemed to ask us to keep our eyes on the people more than the products.
SNT.87701.9673	That's not to say he has not found his latest ICQ, though only time—and consumers—will tell.
SNT.87701.9674	For a Web 2.User like myself, I was most fascinated by Fixya, a site that, like Wikipedia, exists on the free work of people with knowledge.
SNT.87701.9675	Fixya is a tech support site where people who are having problems with equipment ask a question and it is answered by registered "experts."
SNT.87701.9676	These experts are the equivalent of Wikipedia's editors: they are self-ordained purveyors of solutions.
SNT.87701.9677	But instead of solving a mystery of knowledge a reader has in their head, these experts solve a problem related to something you have bought and do not understand.
SNT.87701.9678	From baby cribs to cellular phones, over 500,000 products are "supported" on Fixya's website.
SNT.87701.9679	The Fixya business model relies upon the good will of its experts to want to help other people through the ever-expanding world of consumer appliances.
SNT.87701.9680	But it is different from Wikipedia in two important ways.
SNT.87701.9681	The altruistic exchange of information is somewhat dampened by the knowledge that somebody, somewhere, is profiting from whatever you give.
SNT.87701.9682	Second, with Wikipedia it is very easy for a person to type in a few sentences about a subject on an article about the Toshiba Satellite laptop, but to answer technical problems a person is experiencing seems like a different realm.
SNT.87701.9683	"People really want to help other people," said the presenter, who marveled at the community that has already developed on Fixya.
SNT.87701.9684-1	"Another difference from Wikipedia is that we have a premium content version of the site."
SNT.87701.9684-2	Their premium site is where they envision making their money.
SNT.87701.9685	Customers with a problem will assign a dollar amount based upon how badly they need an answer to a question, and the expert-editors of Fixya will share in the payment for the resolved issue.
SNT.87701.9686	Whereas Wikipedia editors are judged by how they are perceived in the Wiki community, the amount of barnstars they receive and by the value of their contributions, Fixya's customers rate its experts based upon the usefulness of their advice.
SNT.87701.9687	The site is currently working on offering extended warranties with some manufacturers, although it was not clear how that would work on a site that functioned on the work of any expert.
SNT.87701.9688	Another collaborative effort product presented to us was YouFig, which is software designed to allow a group of people to collaborate on work product.
SNT.87701.9689	This is not a new idea, although may web-based products have generally fallen flat.
SNT.87701.9690	The idea is that people who are working on a multi-media project can combine efforts to create a final product.
SNT.87701.9691	They envision their initial market to be academia, but one could see the product stretching to fields such as law, where large litigation projects with high-level of collaboration on both document creation and media presentation; in business, where software aimed at product development has generally not lived up to its promises; and in the science and engineering fields, where multi-media collaboration is quickly becoming not only the norm, but a necessity.
SNT.87701.9692	For the popular consumer market, Superna, whose offices hosted our meeting, demonstrated their cost-saving vision for the Smart Home (SH).
SNT.87701.9693	Current SH systems require a large, expensive server in order to coordinate all the electronic appliances in today's air-conditioned, lit and entertainment-saturated house.
SNT.87701.9694	Such coordinating servers can cost upwards of US$5,000, whereas Superna's software can turn a US$1,000 hand-held tablet PC into household remote control.
SNT.87701.9695	There were a few start-ups where Vardi's fatherly mentoring seemed more at play than long-term practical business modeling.
SNT.87701.9696	In the hot market of WiFi products, WeFi is software that will allow groups of users, such as friends, share knowledge about the location of free Internet WiFi access, and also provide codes and keys for certain hot spots, with access provided only to the trusted users within a group.
SNT.87701.9697	The mock-up that was shown to us had a Google Maps-esque city block that had green points to the known hot spots that are available either for free (such as those owned by good Samaritans who do not secure their WiFi access) or for pay, with access information provided for that location.
SNT.87701.9698	I saw two long-term problems: first, WiMAX, which is able to provide Internet access to people for miles within its range.
SNT.87701.9699	There is already discussion all over the Internet as to whether this technology will eventually make WiFi obsolete, negating the need to find "hot spots" for a group of friends.
SNT.87701.9700-1	The second problem is if good Samaritans are more easily located, instead of just happened-upon, how many will keep their WiFi access free?
SNT.87701.9700-2	 It has already become more difficult to find people willing to contribute to free Internet.
SNT.87701.9701	Even in Tel Aviv, and elsewhere, I have come across several secure wireless users who named their network "Fuck Off" in an in-your-face message to freeloaders.
SNT.87701.9702	Another child of Vardi's that the Brookings Institution might say was over-praised for self-esteem but lacking real accomplishment is AtlasCT, although reportedly Nokia offered to pay US$8.1 million for the software, which they turned down.

SNT.83075.9708	Nearly 330,000 people in San Diego County, California located in the United States are being ordered to evacuate after massive wildfires started to spread and grow.
SNT.83075.9709	As a result, U.S. President George W. Bush has declared a state of emergency in California clearing the way for federal aid assistance.
SNT.83075.9710	"All of us across this nation are concerned for the families who have lost their homes and the many families who have been evacuated from their homes."

SNT.83075.9713	Firefighters now fear that the fires could merge into one giant blaze if the Santa Ana Winds continue sending close to if not over 500,000 people running for safety.
SNT.83075.9714	One person has died as a result of the fires with 42 injured.
SNT.83075.9715	16 of those are reported to be firefighters who were battling the blazes.

SNT.48681.9726	India's nominee for the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations, Shashi Tharoor has revealed a four-point plan to tackle the problems the international body is facing.
SNT.48681.9727	He said that the biggest hurdle faced by the UN is that it has to deal with a large number of issues at the same time.
SNT.48681.9728	The United Nations with its "impressive achievements" and "haunting failures" has changed but needs to change further, he said in an article in Newsweek International.
SNT.48681.9729	Tharoor's proposal is concentrated on four areas- making democracy a priority; bolstering the ranks (of the United Nations); prioritising and streamlining; and healing wounds.
SNT.48681.9730	He talked about the crisis in the Middle East, and the nuclear standoff between the U.N and countries like North Korea and Iran, referring to them as "obvious and trying".
SNT.48681.9731	He also pointed out "problems without passports" such as climate change, narcotics smuggling and human rights violations.
SNT.48681.9732	Tharoor, a leading candidate to succeed Kofi Annan, said that strengthening the capacities of both the UN and its member-states was the best way to deal with these problems.
SNT.48681.9733	Tharoor stated that further efforts were needed to promote democracy and good governance the world over.
SNT.48681.9734	"We now have a Democracy Fund to help us do that, financed not just by the rich West but by countries like India," he said.
SNT.48681.9735	He also pointed out that the UN should try and stand up more for human rights by making sure the Human Rights Council did its job more effectively than the "over-politicised" Human Rights Commission it replaced.
SNT.48681.9736	He said the UN should support the efforts bodies like NATO and the EU were making in their peacekeeping.
SNT.48681.9737	Tharoor also spoke about the conflict in Iraq, saying "And where the task, like enforcing peace in Iraq, is clearly beyond us (the UN), we should let wars be fought by warriors, not peacekeepers,"
SNT.48681.9738-1	In reference to "healing wounds", he pointed out the danger of the Cold War divisions being replaced by a North-South divide at the UN.
SNT.48681.9738-2	"The new secretary-general must urgently combat this."
SNT.48681.9739	"I would focus on building issue-based coalitions to deal with specific practical problems (things like management inefficiencies, procurement policies, information technology, outsourcing) that have little to do with ideological politics," he said.
SNT.48681.9740	Tharoor is currently the UN's Under Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information.
SNT.48681.9741	He and South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki Moon are considered frontrunners in the race to succeed Annan, whose term ends at the end of the year.
SNT.48681.9742	Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai and former UN disarmament chief Jayantha Dhanapala from Sri Lanka are also official candidates for the top UN job.
SNT.5272.9743	An analysis of melatonin studies has upheld the controversial supplement's effectiveness as a sleep aid.
SNT.5272.9744	The analysis, which included 17 peer-reviewed scientific papers, was aimed at determining whether supplements of the hormone can improve sleep among insomniacs, older adults and others.
SNT.5272.9745	"A meta-analysis essentially tells 'yes' or 'no'—that a treatment does or does not have a significant effect," says Richard Wurtman of MIT, the study's principal investigator.
SNT.5272.9746	"When a meta-analysis says 'yes,' there should no longer be any controversy about whether the treatment works."
SNT.5272.9747	Previous studies by Wurtman and colleagues showed that small doses of melatonin, about 0.3 milligrams, are necessary for restful effects.
SNT.5272.9748	The researchers found, however, that commercially available melatonin pills can contain 10 times the effective amount.
SNT.5272.9749	At that dose, says Wurtman, the hormone's effects end after a few days because melatonin receptors in the brain become unresponsive when exposed to too much of the hormone.
SNT.5272.9750	Such inadvertent overdosing, say the researchers, has contributed to controversy over melatonin's efficacy.
SNT.5272.9751	But the new meta-analysis shows that melatonin does indeed have positive effects on sleep—even though some of the analyzed studies also involved high doses of the hormone.
SNT.5272.9752	The research is reported in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews.
SNT.245885.9753	India won the first match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh by 87 runs on February 19.
SNT.245885.9754	The Group B match was played at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Bangladesh.
SNT.245885.9755	In the Indian innings, Virender Sehwag scored the highest total, 175 runs off 140 balls, his highest one-day international score and Virat Kolhi played his debut World Cup match and scored a century, while remaining unbeaten on 100.
SNT.245885.9756	The first referral of the World Cup came after the 4th ball of the 2nd innings was bowled.
SNT.245885.9757	India's Shanthakumaran Sreesanth had bowled a yorker and the umpire declared it not out.
SNT.245885.9758	Dhoni referred it to the TV umpire and a replay showed it might have missed the leg stump, so the original decision was upheld.
SNT.245885.9759	The match marked the debut of the controversial umpire referral system in World Cup cricket.
SNT.33019.9760	German police are embarrassed after a 27-year-old man, whom they had just booked for burglary, walked out of the police station and stole an unmarked police vehicle.
SNT.33019.9761	"It's not just unusual, it's embarrassing," said a spokesman for police in the town of Eschwege.
SNT.33019.9762	It is thought that the man stole the key from an officer at the station.
SNT.33019.9763	When he was booked and released, he was observed by officers getting into the unmarked police car.
SNT.33019.9764	Three vehicles (including the stolen police car) were damaged during the pursuit.
SNT.33019.9765	The stolen vehicle was recovered upon arrest of its unlawful driver.
SNT.34317.9766	The FBI has confirmed that the chunky substance discovered in the Moore-Hill dormitory at the University of Texas on Thursday is not the poison ricin.
SNT.34317.9767	Ricin is one of the most deadly poisons in the world and can exist in the form of a pellet, mist, or powder.
SNT.34317.9768	Some symptoms of exposure can include vomiting and dehydration, sweating, nausea, fever, cough and difficulty of breathing.
SNT.34317.9769	An earlier report by the Associated Press had said tests had found the substance might be ricin.
SNT.34317.9770	Such tests are designed to error on the side of caution, thus ensuring that possible poisoning victims receive treatment in time.
SNT.34317.9771	Last year there were similar false positive reports of ricin in London, which were further publicized by Vice President Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
SNT.15803.9772	The Speaker of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Thierse, welcomed the decision and urged the parties to conduct fair campaigns.
SNT.15803.9773	Chancellor Schröder also paid his respect to Köhler, calling his decision confident and again expressed that he intents to resume the good way on which Germany is heading under his leadership.
SNT.15803.9774	The Chair of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and her party's candidate for chancellor, Angela Merkel, welcomed the call for early elections and wants to get Germany on the right track if her party gets to power in September.
SNT.15803.9775	The dissolving is the result of a long political muddle that began on May 22th when Schröder's Social Democrats (SPD) lost the most populous state of Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, to the CDU, the biggest opposition party.
SNT.15803.9776	Minutes after the early projections were in, SPD chair Franz Müntefering announced that his party would seek re-election in fall of 2005.
SNT.15803.9777	However, the Basic Law of Germany does not permit the self-dissolving of the Bundestag.
SNT.15803.9778	The only way to achieve early elections is when the chancellor loses a motion of confidence.
SNT.15803.9779	All major parties, including the opposition, support the call for early election.
SNT.15803.9780	Polls also indicate that 75% of the population support going to the ballots in September.
SNT.15803.9781	However, some MP's, most notably Werner Schulz of SPD's coalition partner, The Greens, say that the procedure was unconstitutional because the loss of confidence was orchestrated.
SNT.15803.9782	They announced that they will sue against the dissolving before the Constitutional Court of Germany.
SNT.15803.9783	Germany has been struggling with high unemployment for several years and the reforms Schröder introduced were criticized as being neo-liberalistic by unions and also by members of his own party.
SNT.15803.9784	Current polls see the CDU at 44%, while the SPD can only expect 27%.
SNT.15803.9785	The liberal FDP, CDU's possible coalition partner, can expect 7%, The Greens 8% and the Party of the Left (formerly PDS) 11%.
SNT.15803.9786	The governing SPD-Green coalition is faced with an overwhelming opposition majority in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber, that is able to block most bills.
SNT.15803.9787	Schröder claims that the CDU is engaging in a policy of blockade rendering him unable to make laws and implement policy changes while Angela Merkel, says that Schröder's government is simply incapable to take action.
SNT.32893.9788	The Albuquerque Academy eighth grade basketball team used tough defense to close out the 2005-2006 season with a win, 46-30 over Los Lunas.
SNT.32893.9789	The Chargers spread things evenly in the first quarter; five players scored for the team in the period.
SNT.32893.9790	Both forward Jon Cabarrus and guard Dylan Gordon followed their own shots and scored on putbacks.
SNT.32893.9791	Forwards Xavier Moya and Chris Thompson provided tough inside defense on one possession.
SNT.32893.9792	While Los Lunas managed several rebounds, they were unable to get any baskets over the outstretched arms of Moya and Thompson.
SNT.32893.9793	Cabarrus scored on another putback for his fourth points of the game late in the quarter, helping Academy to a twelve to eight lead at the end of the first.
SNT.32893.9794	The second period was a low scoring one for both teams.
SNT.32893.9795	The Chargers scored just nine points, but also held Los Lunas to only three.
SNT.32893.9796	Both offenses were struggling when guard Andrew Matthew stole the ball and made a pass to Gordan, who threw another pass to fellow guard Jordan Fleisher, who took the ball and scored on a layup.
SNT.32893.9797	With a minute in the half, reserve Matt Brown took a pass and drove the length of the court for a layup.
SNT.32893.9798	Academy ended the second half with a twenty-one to eleven lead.
SNT.32893.9799	Academy again spread the ball around in the second half, with eight Charger players scoring.
SNT.32893.9800	Leading the way in the second half was Patrick Zacharias, who scored seven points in the half.
SNT.32893.9801	Gordon connected with Thompson on a play that gave Thompson a layup.
SNT.32893.9802	Gordon stole the ball away from Los Lunas and made a pass to Thompson while sandwiched between two Los Lunas defenders.
SNT.32893.9803	Thompson received the pass under the basket and scored on a layup.
SNT.32893.9804	Los Lunas came back with a three pointer by #24 and some layups by other players.
SNT.32893.9805	The quarter ended with Academy still holding the lead, 33-22.
SNT.32893.9806	AA was again playing tough defense midway through the fourth quarter until #32 hit a three pointer, sparking a small Los Lunas rally, but it was not enough to overcome the offense and defense of the Chargers.
SNT.32893.9807	Zacharias scored on a tip in of a Gordon shot that hung on the rim and fell out.
SNT.32893.9808	Zacharias was also fouled on the shot and made the free throw to complete the three point play.
SNT.32893.9809	Team manager Lincoln Stanfield also saw action in the game, and even scored his first points of the season at the end of the fourth quarter.
SNT.32893.9810	With less than fifteen seconds left, Stanfield received a pass underneath the basket.
SNT.32893.9811	His shot didn't fall, but he was fouled with seven seconds left.
SNT.32893.9812	Stanfield's first free throw bounced up after hitting the rim but didn't fall through.
SNT.32893.9813	His second shot bounced high in the air two times before falling through the hoop.
SNT.32893.9814	Stanfield threw his arms up in celebration over his made shot, putting an end to Academy's 14-1 season.
SNT.78043.9815	Arung Samudera, the Indonesian naval tall ship that was recently grounded off Queensland, Australia, has been salvaged from the beach at Inskip Point and is currently being towed to Brisbane for repairs.
SNT.78043.9816	The 35m vessel has been stranded since last Thursday, when she was grounded whilst on her way to the APEC meeting in Sydney.
SNT.78043.9817	The ship is expected to berth in Brisbane near the naval barracks at approximately 11 a.m. (AEST).
SNT.78043.9818	The tri-masted sailing training vessel, built in New Zealand, is believed to be seaworthy, but has serious damage to her keel and rudder.
SNT.78043.9819	After the completion of repairs, the ship is expected to continue to Sydney, although it will not reach it in time for the APEC meeting.
SNT.78043.9820	The ship's 18-man crew are said to be "very happy" with developments.
SNT.78043.9821	According to the Australian Navy's Commander Forbes Peters, Indonesian officials are as pleased as the ships crew, with Peters saying "The naval attache and the first secretary to the ambassador are on site here and they cuddled Lieutenant Commander Larry Cook."
SNT.78043.9822	"They are over the moon and I'm sure the commanding officer is as well, even though he's currently at sea on his ship."
SNT.47244.9823	Palestinian gunmen have reportedly kidnapped two foreign journalists working for Fox News, a news company owned by parent-company News Corp.
SNT.47244.9824	A Palestinian witness who worked with the journalists, said that American reporter Steve Centanni, and Olaf Wiig, a cameraman from New Zealand were taken against their will.
SNT.47244.9825	New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokeswoman Helen Tunnah said that the ministry had not received any information on the kidnapping.
SNT.47244.9826	Fox News said that they did not know who captured the journalists but said that "We can confirm that two of our people were taken against their will in Gaza," and that "negotiations were under way to secure their release."
SNT.47244.9827	The incident began when two vehicles blocked the transmission truck, labelled 'TV', and their bodyguard was forced to the ground at gunpoint by a masked man.
SNT.47244.9828	Hamas, the Islamic militant group that heads Gaza's government, did not claim responsibility, and condemned the kidnapping.
SNT.47244.9829	Fox News Vice President John Moody said in an internal message to Fox News personnel that "The rumors are true: two of our employees have been abducted in Gaza."
SNT.47244.9830	"Do not comment officially and of course, not on the air, about it."
SNT.140446.9831	Parties to a lawsuit against Amazon.com agreed September 25 to a proposed settlement resolving claims that Amazon unlawfully deleted content from users' Kindle reading devices.
SNT.140446.9832	Justin Gawronski, a Michigan high school senior, and Antoine Bruguier, a California engineer, had sued on July 30, after Amazon deleted George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four from their Kindles.
SNT.140446.9833	Gawronski also said his digital notes lost value because they were no longer associated with the relevant text.
SNT.140446.9834	The plaintiffs argued that Amazon had breached its terms of service and violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Washington Consumer Protection Act.
SNT.140446.9835	Amazon had first claimed it was forced to delete the books when it learned it did not have the right to sell them.
SNT.140446.9836	However, it apologized on July 23 and on September 7 offered affected customers either US$30 or a copy of the deleted book.
SNT.140446.9837	The proposed settlement includes a commitment that Amazon will only delete e-books remotely under four circumstances: the user consents, the user fails to pay or gets a refund, the government mandates it, or the deletion is necessary to "protect" the consumer, device, or network.
SNT.140446.9838	Amazon would also pay KamberEdelson, the plaintiffs' firm, US$150,000 in legal fees, with the proviso that it go to charity.
SNT.140446.9839	Michael Aschenbrener, an attorney at KamberEdelson, described the agreement as a "great settlement" that "provides protection for Kindle users and provides confidence to them that the books, newspapers and magazines they purchase will not be subject to remote deletion by Amazon."
SNT.140446.9840	"It sends a message to digital media purveyors of all kinds that sellers really need to respect users' rights to that content."
SNT.783.9841	Hassan Rowhani, head of the Supreme National Security Council for Iran, announced Monday that the country would temporarily suspend conversion of uranium as of November 22.
SNT.783.9842	"Iran is planning to suspend uranium conversion activities from November 22," Rowhani said during a news conference.
SNT.783.9843	Uranium is a chemical element which can be used in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.
SNT.783.9844	The process of conversion modifies the uranium oxides into uranium hexafluoride.
SNT.783.9845	The purpose of such a conversion process is usually an intermediate step in the production of nuclear fuel.
SNT.783.9846	Uranium hexafluoride cannot itself be used in a nuclear weapon, but can be enriched into weapons-grade uranium, or it can be converted into plutonium in a nuclear reactor.
SNT.783.9847	Iran has claimed to be using its nuclear program for only peaceful nuclear energy, rather than for nuclear weapons, but there are concerns in the European Union and the USA as to whether they are being truthful.
SNT.104790.9848	Software giant Microsoft has been attempting to purchase Internet giant Yahoo! in hopes of leveraging the internet presence of Yahoo! in Microsoft's battle with Google.
SNT.104790.9849	The original offer for Yahoo! was $44 billion; however since this offer Microsoft has seen a revenue drop this last quarter which could greatly affect the software giant's ability to up the price again in hopes Yahoo! would accept.
SNT.104790.9850	This includes a 24% drop in revenue from the Windows Operating System alone.
SNT.104790.9851	Stock prices of both Microsoft and Yahoo! have decreased during the merger discussions.
SNT.104790.9852	Microsoft's next move is unknown but there has been talk of potentially going directly to the Yahoo! shareholders with a buyout plan.
SNT.104790.9853	It is too early to tell how this will end, but Microsoft has made it known that it will try all available routes; up to and including a hostile takeover.
SNT.104790.9854	Recent comments from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and CFO Chris Liddell have mentioned that not acquiring Yahoo! is also an option.
SNT.104790.9855	Whatever Microsoft's plan is, the longer this takes, the more competitor Google will likely use this to their advantage is obtaining both clients and employees, says Juan Carlos Perez of IDG.
SNT.61264.9856	The state broadcaster of New Zealand, Television New Zealand (TVNZ), has announced its plans to fire at least 160 people because they have falling revenue, mainly from their NZ$9.3 million advertising loss.
SNT.61264.9857	A memorandum, or "memo", was circulating the 1,100 employer, TVNZ yesterday from CEO, Rick Ellis, which stated that their "guesstimate" of job losses was around 130-160.
SNT.61264.9858	50 of the job losses will be from the news and current affairs department, where a total of 350 people currently work.
SNT.61264.9859	The numbers are not set in stone, according to a spokesperson for TVNZ.
SNT.61264.9860	The lay-offs have been expected since late last year where he announced it to a parliamentary select committee.
SNT.61264.9861	The union which represents some of the staff working at TVNZ, Engineering Printing and Manufacturing Union, said that some of the staff are asking themselves how TVNZ will be able to start and manage the new digital 24 hour news channel with fewer staff.
SNT.61264.9862	In two weeks time, staff will be asked what they think of the proposed changes, which also includes a top level management restructuring.
SNT.61264.9863	Steve Mahery, broadcasting minister, said, "The restructuring of TVNZ is an operational issue, and I expect they'll meet their charter requirements."
SNT.61264.9864	"How they structure the company to achieve this is entirely up to them."
SNT.54060.9865	It is reported that Margaret Beckett, UK Foreign Secretary, is considering becoming the first UK Government Minister to admit to a link between the invasion of Iraq and the threat of terrorism in UK.
SNT.54060.9866	This follows a leak last week of Cabinet papers that demand "a significant reduction in the number and intensity of the regional conflicts that fuel terror activity".
SNT.54060.9867	Prime Minister Tony Blair has always claimed that the war in Iraq has not fuelled terrorism in UK; that there was terrorism long before the invasion.
SNT.54060.9868	This despite the posthumous video recording of one of the 7/7 bombers, Shehzad Tanweer who said his actions were provoked by British foreign policy and that attacks would continue until British soldiers were withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan.
SNT.54060.9869	Beckett is considering admitting the link between Iraq and terrorism in UK when discussing the problem of Muslim youth becoming influenced by international terrorists.
SNT.54060.9870	She has already disagreed openly with Prime Minister Blair recently by demanding that there be public debate into the need for the replacement of the Trident missile system and the Royal Navy's Vanguard class submarines, by apologising for the Iraq invasion and by not disagreeing with General Sir Richard Dannatt, who said that British troops in Iraq were provoking trouble.
SNT.82530.9871	According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 4.2 earthquake with a depth of just under two miles, has struck California approximately 3 miles (5 kilometers) northeast of Wrightwood.
SNT.82530.9872	The USGS states that there could be some damage, but that it would likely be "very light," but so far the San Bernardino County Fire Department says that no damage has been reported.
SNT.82530.9873	There are no reports of any injuries, but witnesses say that they were awoken from their sleep as far away as Los Angeles.
SNT.4877.9874	Some 500,000 people gathered today in Rome to march silently, demanding the liberation of Giuliana Sgrena, a reporter who was kidnapped on February 4 in Iraq.
SNT.4877.9875	Politicians, associations and citizens took part in the gathering, set up by the Communist newspaper Il Manifesto, Sgrena's employer.
SNT.4877.9876	According to demonstrators there were 500,000 people, while the Police estimates a turnout of 200,000.
SNT.4877.9877	"The march is a way to say, loud and clear, that we want Giuliana Sgrena to be freed... to say no to terrorism and violence", Piero Fassino, leader of the Democratici di Sinistra (Democrats of the Left) party, said.
SNT.4877.9878	Giuliana Sgrena was kidnapped near Baghdad's University on February 4 while she was covering Iraqi elections for Il Manifesto.
SNT.4877.9879	On February 15 Associated Press Television received a video showing Sgrena demanding help from Italian politicians and people, and asking for Italian troop's withdrawal from Iraq.
SNT.25891.9880	British Prime Minister Tony Blair could face a House of Commons inquiry into claims that chief police officers were pressured to support a political agenda during Wednesday's vote to extend detention without charge.
SNT.25891.9881	Chief police officers were asked to lobby MPs wavering over the introduction of a controversial new law allowing police to detain a terror suspect for 90 days without charge.
SNT.25891.9882	Although the proposal was rejected by the House of Commons, the lobbying has provoked criticism from senior members of the opposition Conservative Party, who are pushing for an inquiry into the behaviour of government ministers towards the police and for 'embroiling them in politics'.
SNT.25891.9883	Former Tory cabinet minister Peter Lilley said: "Every chief constable knows their job is up for re-selection in the next year or so."
SNT.25891.9884	Home Office minister Hazel Blears denied the claims: "It is entirely proper that the police were there to make their case and for Parliament to consider it."
SNT.25891.9885	"Certainly, as a Member of Parliament I would want to have the benefit of the best professional advice I could get before reaching my decision."
SNT.44365.9886	Asteroid 2004 XP14, a half-mile wide chunk of hard rock travelling at 40 000 miles an hour, will miss the Earth by a few hundred thousand miles, Monday.
SNT.44365.9887	Dr David Asher from the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland said if the rock, discovered in 2004, were to hit the Earth the result would be devastating.
SNT.44365.9888	"It would probably be big enough to wipe out a small country," he said.
SNT.44365.9889	Amateur astronomers with 6-inch telescopes would be able to follow the speeding space debris in Europe and North America at its closest approach to the planet at 0425 UTC.
SNT.44365.9890	At this time it would be at a safe distance of 268,624 miles from Earth - closer to the Earth than the Moon would be at its farthest extent in its orbit.
SNT.44365.9891	2004 XP14 is named as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA), along with 782 known others by Astronomers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Harvard.
SNT.44365.9892	Zipping about in the solar system no PHAs have yet been found on direct collision course with the Earth.
SNT.44365.9893	Still, "For something of this size to come this close is unusual," said Don Yeomans, the head of NASA's Near Earth Object Program.
SNT.44365.9894	An expert at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said it was the closest approach by such a massive object for over 80 years - since 1925.
SNT.44365.9895	Before 2004 XP14's exact orbital path around the sun was known with more precision, there were concerns it would hit the Earth.
SNT.44365.9896	In the near future Jon Giorgini said such cosmic uncertainty would be much less and the public less alarmed.
SNT.44365.9897	"In the next 20 to 30 years, we'll have a complete catalog of hazardous objects," Giorgini said.
SNT.44365.9898	Edward Lu and Stanley Love, of Johnson Space Centre, Houston, also have allayed fears about a collision.
SNT.44365.9899	In a 2005 article in Nature they theorised a "gravity tractor" could move any known threat within a year.
SNT.11106.9900	After an investigation of allegations that Islam's holy book the Qu'ran was mishandled in front of inmates at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the Bush administration has acknowledged the credibility of some of these reports.
SNT.11106.9901	According to Robert Burns of the Associated Press, U.S. military officials acknowledged that, "a Muslim holy book was splashed with urine," and "a detainee's Quran was deliberately kicked and another's was stepped on."
SNT.11106.9902	The US government first denied a specific report that the Qu'ran had been flushed down a toilet at the prison facility, but on Friday agreed that similar allegations were indeed true.
SNT.11106.9903	On May 16, Newsweek magazine apologized to the victims of deadly riots that ensued due to a Newsweek article stating that U.S. officials defiled the Qur'an.
SNT.11106.9904	White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan criticized Newsweek's initial response to the incident, saying it was "puzzling."
SNT.11106.9905	Later that day, Newsweek retracted the story, which the White House said was a "good first step".
SNT.11106.9906	On May 20, the International Red Cross (IRC) revealed in a rare public announcement that it had documented and reported to the United States credible information concerning desecration of the Qur'an by Guantanamo Bay personnel.
SNT.11106.9907	Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman, acknowledged that allegations were made on "rare occasions" but were uncorroborated.
SNT.11106.9908	Simon Schorno, a Red Cross spokesman, disputed the Pentagon's denial saying, "All information we received were corroborated allegations."
SNT.11106.9909	Scott McClellan explained in a press conference that the White House is not trying to tell Newsweek what to print.
SNT.11106.9910	McClellan said, "Look, this report caused serious damage to the image of the United States abroad."
SNT.11106.9911	"We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story."
SNT.11106.9912	"Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report."
SNT.11106.9913	"But, no, you're absolutely right, it's not my position to get into telling people what they can and cannot report."
SNT.11106.9914	On May 25, Amnesty International called for the shutdown on Guantanamo Bay due to numerous human rights violations, saying "The 'war on terror' appeared more effective in eroding international human rights principles than in countering international 'terrorism'."
SNT.11106.9915	Amnesty International's view was shared by both the International Red Cross (IRC) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
SNT.11106.9916	The IRC has said it reported to the U.S. government detainee's reports of desecration of the Qur'an.
SNT.11106.9917	In the foreword of the report, written by Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan, Guantanamo was compared to a Soviet-era gulag in that it is "entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law".
SNT.11106.9918	White House spokesman Scott McClellan responded saying the report's allegations were "ridiculous and unsupported by the facts."
SNT.11106.9919	"The United States is leading the way when it comes to protecting human rights and promoting human dignity."
SNT.11106.9920	"We have liberated 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan."
SNT.11106.9921	"We have worked to advance freedom and democracy in the world so that people are governed under a rule of law and that there are... protections in place for minority rights, that women's rights are advanced so that women can fully participate in societies where now they cannot", as well as supporting the fight against AIDS in Africa.
SNT.11106.9922	About the allegations of abuse at Guantanamo, which McClellan has previously called isolated incidents, he said, "We hold people accountable when there is abuse."
SNT.11106.9923	"We take steps to prevent it from happening again, and we do so in a very public way for the world to see that we lead by example, and that we do have values that we hold very dearly and believe in."
SNT.11106.9924	On May 31, U.S. President George W. Bush dismissed the human rights report as "absurd" for its harsh criticism of U.S. treatment of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying the allegations were made by prisoners "who hate America."
SNT.11106.9925	"The United States is a country that promotes freedom around the world," Bush said of the Amnesty International report.
SNT.11106.9926	William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA, defended the report, saying, "What is 'absurd' is President Bush's attempt to deny the deliberate policies of his administration."
SNT.11106.9928	Irene Khan also responded saying, "The administration's response has been that our report is absurd, that our allegations have no basis, and our answer is very simple: if that is so, open up these detention centres, allow us and others to visit them."
SNT.11106.9929	And, on Friday, the U.S. military released the results of their investigation and confirmed that in 5 separate incidents, American guards at the Guantánamo Bay prison "mishandled" the Islamic holy book.
SNT.11106.9930	However, they stress that guards were usually "respectful" of the Qur'an.
SNT.11106.9931	One incident involved splashing a Koran with urine by urinating near an air vent while others involved kicking, stepping on and writing in Qur'ans.
SNT.11106.9932	Brigadier-General Jay Hood, the commander of the jail, looked into the allegations, published and then retracted by Newsweek, that American personnel flushed a Qur'an down a toilet.
SNT.11106.9933	He said that the inquiry did not find any evidence supporting this particular allegation.
SNT.11106.9934	"The inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Qur'an down a toilet."
SNT.769244.9935	A 'terrorist attack' took place yesterday in the form of reportedly at least four explosions at the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, India.
SNT.769244.9936	Four other explosions took place in the vicinity, including one near an eighty-foot tall statue of Buddha and three at Tergar Monastery.
SNT.769244.9937	Early reports claim little damage was done to the temple.
SNT.769244.9938	Police commented that Sundays are quiet days at the temple, or more could have been injured.
SNT.769244.9939	One suspect has been arrested based on closed circuit television that recorded two men placing bombs at the temple.
SNT.769244.9940	Mahabodhi Temple is considered one of the holiest sites in Buddhism and in India.
SNT.769244.9941	Totaling twelve acres, it is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.
SNT.769244.9942	The temple is located next to the Bodhi tree, where Buddhists believe that Buddha achieved enlightenment.
SNT.769244.9943	The bombs were described as "low-intensity but not crude," according to police.
SNT.769244.9944	The bombs used comprised of a small container with gas, a detonator, and an analog clock.
SNT.769244.9945	The bombs were timed to explode at 5:45 AM local time, when Buddhists start praying in the morning.
SNT.769244.9946	The bombs actually went off starting at 5:25 AM and ending at 5:58 AM local time.
SNT.769244.9947	Early reports state that while the temple suffered little damage, the staircase near the Bodhi tree suffered damage and windows were broken.
SNT.769244.9948	200 monks live at the monastery, where daily classes take place during the times when the explosions happened.
SNT.769244.9949	However, no classes were being held the morning of the attack.
SNT.769244.9950	The Ministry of Home Affairs has declared the explosions an act of terrorism.
SNT.769244.9951	In October members of the Indian Mujahideen claimed to have visited Mahabodhi Temple to plan a terrorist attack.
SNT.769244.9952	That led to the arrests of four suspects involved in the Indian Mujahideen, who were believed to have been involved in the 2012 Pune bombings.
SNT.769244.9953	The four suspects named other members of the terrorist group and claimed that they planned to attack Mahabodhi Temple.
SNT.769244.9954	The police in Delhi claim to have told the police in Bihar about the potential of a terrorist attack.
SNT.769244.9955	Political conflict has risen in the wake of the attacks between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress.
SNT.769244.9956	BJP is accusing the United Progressive Alliance, which is under the umbrella of the Indian National Congress, of ignoring the Indian Mujahideen's threats about attacking the temple.
SNT.769244.9957	The Ministry also believes that it could be tied to conflicts in Myanmar between Buddhists and Muslims, despite the rarity of violence against Buddhists in India.
SNT.769244.9958	Additional security has been placed at Buddhist temples and Tibetan communities in India after the explosions.
SNT.769244.9959	One suspect, Vinod Mistri, was arrested on Monday morning in Patna.
SNT.5882.9960	Two dog attacks in a week puts Spotsylvania County authorities in the spotlight to take action on pet owners for their dog's behavior.
SNT.5882.9961	In unrelated incidences, an elderly woman was killed and another woman was bitten.
SNT.5882.9962	An 82 year old woman was walking her Shih Tzu breed of dog in her front yard last week when she came under attack by three Pit Bulls.
SNT.5882.9963	She died being transported to the hospital after police responded and shot two of the attacking dogs.
SNT.5882.9964	More recently, a 31 year old woman was bitten on her hand during a fight that ensued between two Pit Bulls in her back yard.
SNT.5882.9965	Public outcry over the death of the elderly woman stirred procecutors to charge the dogs' owner, Deeana Large, with involuntary manslaughter.
SNT.5882.9966	This is a first for the Commonwealth of Virginia where charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years are leveled in a case involving a pet's owner.
SNT.5882.9967	In order to gain an indictment, prosecuters will have to prove the dogs' owner was criminally negligent.
SNT.5882.9968	In the biting incident, the attacking dog's owner faces a misdemeanor charge of letting the dog run at large.
SNT.5882.9969	Deeana Large, who initially said she owned only 1 of the 3 dogs involved in the mauling case, has not yet been formally charged and awaits indictment.
SNT.5882.9970	Investigators in the case say there were earlier reports of her dogs allegedly killing a German Shepard and a kittten in her neighborhood.
SNT.5882.9971	Complaints by neighbors spurred an animal control officer to be looking for the dogs at the time the woman was killed.
SNT.48772.9972	Following confirmation by Thailand's caretaker cabinet, a proposal to create a 77th province to honour the king's 80th birthday, will be the subject of a feasibility study.
SNT.48772.9973	Currently the country consists of 75 provinces, it is expected that the 76th province will be around the Suvarnabhumi International Airport which opens in September 2006.
SNT.81507.9974	On September 26, United States Representative Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) introduced a bill to prohibit federal grants to Columbia University in response to Columbia's decision to allow Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak on campus.
SNT.81507.9975	The bill arrived at the House of Representatives within two days after the speaking engagement.
SNT.81507.9976	A portion of the bill requests a denial of funds to the University, "for permitting State terrorist access to campus."
SNT.81507.9977	Iran's parliament, in September this year, labelled the U.S. forces as terrorists.
SNT.81507.9978	Hunter, who is seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, argued in favor of the bill last week.
SNT.81507.9979	"If the left-wing leaders of academia will not support our troops, they, in the very least, should not support our adversaries," he said.
SNT.81507.9980	"By hosting President Ahmadinejad, Columbia University openly insulted the thousands of servicemen and women serving in Iraq, most of whom are direct targets of the munitions that he is sending across the Iraq-Iran border."
SNT.81507.9981	Prior to Ahmedinejad's speech, U.S. President George W. Bush expressed a different view, saying that Columbia's invitation "really speaks to the freedoms of the country."
SNT.81507.9982	"I'm not so sure I'd offer the same invitation, but nevertheless, it speaks volumes about the greatness, really, of America."
SNT.81507.9983	"We're confident enough to let a person express his views," he said.
SNT.132079.9984	University of Oregon football's star running back, LeGarrette Blount, was suspended for the remainder of the season – and thereby the remainder of his college football career – after punching an opposing player after the opening game.
SNT.132079.9985	The University of Oregon Ducks opened their 2009 season with a 19–8 loss to rival Boise State Broncos.
SNT.132079.9986	The high-profile game was nationally televised on the ESPN network.
SNT.132079.9987	The volatile Blount, coming off a 1,000+ yard season in which he broke a school record for rushing touchdowns, had struggled in several 2008 games, including the encounter with the Broncos.
SNT.132079.9988	The Broncos, however, won 19–8 in their home field; and Blount and Oregon's offense failed to achieve a single first down for the game's first 37 minutes.
SNT.132079.9989	A few seconds after the end of the game, Boise State defensive end Byron Hout taunted Blount and pushed him on the shoulder pad.
SNT.132079.9990	But Blount responded with a swift punch to the jaw, knocking Hout to the ground.
SNT.132079.9991	Blount then pushed teammate Garrett Embry, who was attempting to restrain him.
SNT.132079.9992	Boise State replayed the punch on their large screen in the end-zone multiple times, before Blount had returned to the locker room.
SNT.132079.9993	As he was escorted to the locker room, Blount confronted jeering Boise State fans.
SNT.132079.9994	Two police officers and Oregon assistant coach Scott Frost restrained Blount and escorted him into the locker room.
SNT.132079.9995	Blount apologized after the incident, saying: "I just apologize to everybody that was watching this — ESPN, national TV — I just apologize to all of our fans, all the Boise fans."
SNT.132079.9996	"I lost my head, and I shouldn't have taken it that far."
SNT.132079.9997	Coach Chip Kelly suspended Blount for the remainder of the 2009 season.
SNT.132079.9998	Blount was not dismissed from the team, however, and will be permitted to attend practice and retain his scholarship.
SNT.132079.9999	The incident was seen an important test for a leadership team in its first year.
SNT.132079.10000	According to Oregon Athletic Director Mike Bellotti, the fact that the incident occurred after the game's conclusion made it the team's responsibility, rather than a Pac-10 issue.
SNT.132079.10001	Kelly, Bellotti, and University of Oregon President Lariviere had each just entered the first year of his position.
SNT.132079.10002	Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott, also in his first year, was in attendance at the game.
SNT.132079.10003	He consulted with Oregon officials in advance of Blount's suspension, and afterward, the Pac-10 expressed complete support for the suspension, while declining to comment on the Broncos, who are not part of the Pac-10.
SNT.132079.10004	As a result of his negative rushing total (-5 yards) in the one game he played in the 2009 season prior to the suspension, combined with 1,002 yards in 2008, Blount holds the unusual distinction of having a 1,000-yard season with the Ducks, but less than 1,000 yards over his entire NCAA career.
SNT.145349.10005	An explosion yesterday in a Russian nightclub killed at least 94 people and injured a further 139, according to police reports.
SNT.145349.10006	The incident happened in the "Lame Horse" bar in the city of Perm near the Ural mountains.
SNT.145349.10007	According to the regional security minister, Igor Orlov, the club's plastic ceiling caught fire, ignited by firecrackers.
SNT.145349.10008	Security officials, however, commented that the blast could not have been terrorism.
SNT.145349.10009	"We are not talking about a terrorist attack, we are talking about a failure to observe fire regulations," said an official for an investigative body, as quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency.
SNT.145349.10010	A reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency remarked: "Officials have been cited as saying that the incident may have been caused by pyrotechnics that caused an explosion leading to a significant loss of life."
SNT.42441.10011	On June 5, gunmen, who had posed as police officers, raided a bus station in central Baghdad and captured 50 people.
SNT.42441.10012	Attackers raided bus stations and seized travellers and local vendors.
SNT.42441.10013	This happened a day after 21 people were dragged off buses and killed in Diyala province.
SNT.42441.10014	Of the 50 people, there are two Syrians and one is an Interior Ministry official.
SNT.42441.10015	The gunmen rounded up people from the area including people from the many travel agencies that populate the area.
SNT.42441.10016	The people were then herded into cars and taken away.
SNT.42441.10017	"They took all the workers from the company and nearby shops," says Haidar Mohammed Eleibi, who works for the Swan Transportation Co. in the Salihiya business district.
SNT.42441.10018	Most of the buses at the station were headed to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

SNT.130474.10030	A five-story hotel building along the river in Taitung has collapsed due to the raging flood.
SNT.130474.10031	In some areas of the country, the storm dumped as much as two metres of water.
SNT.130474.10032	Morakot has resulted in the deaths of at least fourteen people in Taiwan and a further 22 deaths in the Philippines.
SNT.127775.10033	According to Iranian state run media, current Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has won re-election by a margin of 2 to 1.
SNT.127775.10034	According to the reports, the country's interior minister says Ahmadinejad won with 66% of the votes counted so far in the nation's election on Friday.
SNT.127775.10035	One of Ahmadinejad opponents Mir Hossein Mousavi, had earlier declared himself "definitely" the winner and said he may dispute the results.
SNT.127775.10036	At present, there are unconfirmed reports that Mir Hossein Mousavi may have been detained by "members of the intelligence community".
SNT.127775.10037	In addition, there are unconfirmed reports that Mousavi's Tehran campaign headquarters was surrounded by the intelligence service as well.

SNT.86815.10045	All Amtrak trains between Chicago and Michigan are currently cancelled while workers remove the locomotive from the scene and perform any needed repairs.
SNT.86815.10046	A National Transportation Safety Board "Go Team" led by Ted Turpin was dispatched to the scene to conduct a federal investigation into the crash.
SNT.567405.10047	The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, has become the first Arab leader to visit the Gaza Strip since its occupation by Israel in 1967.
SNT.567405.10048	He entered the strip by car from Egypt, to an enthusiastic welcome by Gazans.
SNT.567405.10049	Much of the strip's infrastructure was destroyed by Israeli bombing in 2008.
SNT.567405.10050	The Emir of Qatar called for unity of the various Palestinian groups.
SNT.567405.10051-1	Speaking at Gaza's Islamic University, he asked, "Why are you staying divided?"

SNT.567405.10053	Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas contacted the emir directly to point out the international community recognizes Mr Abbas as the Palestinian leader.
SNT.567405.10054	Spokesman Yigal Palmor for Israel's Foreign Ministry said, "This is more than strange, especially since Hamas is internationally recognized as a terror group."
SNT.567405.10055	"By hugging Hamas publicly, the emir of Qatar has thrown peace under the bus."
SNT.567405.10056	The emir founded the Al Jazeera international television news network.

SNT.129421.10064	Both sets of cases were confirmed from batches of 24 samples sent for testing.
SNT.129421.10065	The 8 cases confirmed on Wednesday were all men, 7 from Suva and 1 from Nadi.
SNT.129421.10066	All 16 of the cases confirmed on Thursday were from Suva, 8 men and 8 women.

SNT.107267.10068	2008 COMPUTEX, famed as the 2nd-largest ICT trade show in the world, started today at the Taipei World Trade Center, Taipei International Convention Center, and TWTC Nangang with 1725 companies' participation including top 5 nations - Hong Kong, South Korea, China, France, and Japan.
SNT.107267.10069	With the newly-launched TWTC Nangang, the COMPUTEX set its record with its exhibition scale expanding by 53% and the number of participating manufacturers increasing by 29%.
SNT.107267.10070	This year of COMPUTEX has some special features including "Design and Innovation Award of COMPUTEX", set to discover innovative designs world-wide, "Environment-related topics", highly respected by environmentalists and industrial businesspeople with many ICT products related to energy-efficiency and green technology showcased at "Mega Trends Pavilion".
SNT.107267.10071	With another concurrent trade show - "2008 WiMAX Expo Taipei", located at Taipei Show Hall 2, Taipei Computer Association, one of the show organizers, will mainly promote the "WING"-conceptual products like WiMAX, ICT crossovers, Notebooks, and Green IT products this year.
SNT.107267.10072	In addition, DRAMeXchange Compuforum, e21Forum, Taiwan Design Forum, and Next Generation Network Forum will be held in conjunction with the COMPUTEX to attract international businesspeople from vast industries.
SNT.21629.10073	At least two people have died at a Cypriot army aircraft crash in the village of Kolossi this morning, west of the island's southern coastal town of Limassol.
SNT.21629.10074	Kolossi is a community of some 2,000 Britons, Germans and Cypriots.
SNT.21629.10075	Director of the President's Press Office Marios Karoyan told CNA that the aircraft was a PC - 9 (Pilatus).
SNT.21629.10076	It is one of the two training military aircraft of the National Guard (Cyprus Army) and according to the first reports two people have died, believed to be the two pilots.
SNT.21629.10077	Defence Minister Kyriakos Mavronicolas and National Guard Commander Lieutenant-General Athanasios Nikolodemos have rushed to the area.
SNT.100161.10078	Steve Wright, yesterday convicted of the murder of five women in Ipswich, Suffolk, England, has today been sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court to life imprisonment.
SNT.100161.10079	The bodies of the five women who worked as sex workers in Ipswich were found around the town in December 2006.
SNT.100161.10080	The judge, Mr Justice Gross said that a "substantial degree of pre-meditation and planning" was involved meaning the requirments for a whole life sentence for Wright was met.
SNT.100161.10081	"It is right you should spend your whole life in prison."
SNT.100161.10082	Speaking after the sentencing, Deputy Chief Constable of Suffolk Police, Jacqui Cheer said, "At the start of the inquiry we could not have asked for anything more."
SNT.100161.10083	"It is a tribute to all the people who have been involved - not only police officers but their support teams and all the members of the public who phoned-in offering information."
SNT.197759.10084	A recent scientific review, involving more than 300,000 people across several previous studies, has revealed that inadequate social networking and frequent isolation can have negative effects on a person's health equal to that caused by smoking and alcohol abuse.
SNT.197759.10085	It was found that those who experience sufficient social interactions were 50 per cent more likely to be alive when re-examined eight years later than those who were more socially isolated.
SNT.197759.10086	The scientists on the project ranked having low-quality relationships with friends and family as equivalent to frequent substance abuse (that is to say, 15 cigarettes a day or heavy alcohol consumption) but worse for a person's health than not participating in exercise and being obese.
SNT.197759.10087	Timothy Smith, project leader from Brigham Young University (BYU), in Utah, claims that "the importance of having a network of friends and good family relationships is comparable to quitting smoking and exceeds many risk factors of mortality such as obesity, physical inactivity."
SNT.197759.10088	Related studies have shown that quality relationships stimulate mental and physical health.
SNT.197759.10089	Smith went onto suggest that General Practitioners should also examine a patient's social network to promote good health.
SNT.197759.10090	"Physicians, health professionals, educators and the public media take risk factors such as smoking, diet and exercise seriously."
SNT.197759.10091	"The data presented here make a compelling case for social relationship factors to be added to that list," he continued.
SNT.43482.10092	New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has accused Japan of creating a rift between Pacific Countries.
SNT.43482.10093	She accuses Japan of influencing the voting of some member nations of the Pacific Island Forum at the International Whaling Commission by supplying vast amounts of aid to certain small pacific nations.
SNT.43482.10094	New Zealand provides a total of $23 million a year in aid to three of the six Pacific nations – Kiribati, the Solomons, and Tuvalu.
SNT.43482.10095	Japan pledged approximately 45 billion yen (NZ $633 million) in aid for all Pacific nations.
SNT.43482.10096	New Zealand's annual budget for aiding pacific nations on the other hand totals merely NZ $173 million.
SNT.43482.10097	Miss Clark is quoted as saying "One would hope that over time Japan might reflect on the damage this is doing to [its] relationships around the world" and that it "sprayed a lot of money around" to garner support.
SNT.43482.10098	The Prime Minister has ruled out any retaliation against the islands, saying it would not affect any future aid funding.
SNT.221381.10099	An 18-year-old UK student suspected of throwing a fire extinguisher from the roof of the headquarters of the Conservative Party ('Tories'), 30 Millbank, London, was arrested on Monday.
SNT.221381.10100	He was today released on bail after a court appearance.
SNT.221381.10101	Edward Woollard, who is studying A-levels in Philosophy, Politics, and Classics, at Brockenhurst College in the New Forest, attended last Wednesday's student protests in London, before following a crowd of around 200 students into the Tory HQ and making it to the building's roof, whilst the rest of the building was vandalised.
SNT.221381.10102	Watched by thousands of students gathered outside, a fire extinguisher was thrown from the roof, giving glancing blows to two police officers on the ground 70 feet (21 metres) below.
SNT.221381.10103	Over sixty arrests have been made in conjunction with the protest.
SNT.221381.10104	The sixth-form student, who was wanted on suspicion of attempted murder earlier this week, handed himself in at his local police station and was taken to Belgravia police station for questioning.
SNT.221381.10105	Today, he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with violent disorder, speaking only to confirm his name age and address.
SNT.221381.10106	His lawyer, Matthew Foot, sought adjournment to examine video evidence, and the trial was adjourned until 24 November.
SNT.221381.10107	Until then, Woollard has been granted bail, on condition that he remains at his current address, and does not enter the City of Westminster.
SNT.4162.10108	A United Nations report has shown that sports footwear companies are making progress towards ending the use of sweatshops and are implementing more worker-friendly codes of practice than clothing companies and retailers.
SNT.4162.10109	The study, published by the International Labour Organisation, suggests that consumer pressure is behind the changes.
SNT.4162.10110	As a result of consumer's concerns, footwear companies have been diverting financial and human resources towards developing and implementing better codes of conduct for suppliers.
SNT.4162.10111	Large teams have been established within companies to work toward the goal of better conditions for factory workers.
SNT.4162.10112	The study, based upon interviews with hundreds of managers, activists, government officials, factory workers and worker representatives and visits to companies all over the world, goes on to suggest that workers should be given more powers to oversee conditions in their places of work.
SNT.4162.10113	Clothing companies have been failing to make such good progress due the large number of constantly-changing suppliers they use, with the ILO study describing progress as "spotty."
SNT.4162.10114	A major retailer may have a supply base of over 5,000 different companies, making it more difficult to establish stronger, more effective links with supply companies.
SNT.4162.10115	They have also assigned less manpower to the task of compliance with codes of practice.
SNT.4162.10116	In some areas of the retail industry, there has been almost no compliance with codes of practice.
SNT.253499.10117	India's 2011 census reports that its population has increased by 181 million in the span of one decade, a figure 17.6 percent greater than 2001.
SNT.253499.10118	The census results, publicised today, show the population of India now stands at 1.21 billion.
SNT.253499.10119	C. Chandramauli, the commissioner of the census, said India's population represents "over 17 percent of the world population, [while] India is 2.4 percent of the world’s surface area."
SNT.253499.10120	According to BBC News Online, the current population of the country is in excess of the populations of Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil and the United States put together.
SNT.253499.10121	While India's population has increased by more than 17 percent since the 2001 census, this growth rate is the lowest since India achieved independence in 1947.
SNT.253499.10122	Between 1991 and 2011, the population growth rate has steadily decreased.
SNT.253499.10123	Approximately 25 percent of Indians over the age of seven were found to be illiterate in the 2011 census, a decrease of 10 percent from the census held ten years ago.
SNT.253499.10124	The increase in literate females is greater than that of males, the new census reports.
SNT.253499.10125	The findings have suggested a preference of male over female children.
SNT.253499.10126	For every one thousand boys below the age of seven, there were 914 girls, a decrease from the 2001 census, which reported 927 female for every one thousand male children.
SNT.253499.10127	"This is the lowest ever in the demographic history of the country," he said, and noted "[t]he last census in 2001 had warned us about this, the tendency has worsened."
SNT.253499.10128	This pattern continues although the Indian government has prohibited hospitals from disclosing the gender of an unborn child.
SNT.253499.10129	According to The Washington Post, parents in much of India abort female fetuses and young female children for financial reasons.
SNT.253499.10130	Incidents like this occur more frequently in the better educated and the richer Indian states, including Punjab and Gujarat.
SNT.253499.10131	Pillai, the home secretary, has claimed that "[w]hatever policy measures we have been following in the last 40 years will need a complete review now."
SNT.253499.10132	There are now 940 female adults for every one thousand men, in contrast to 2001, when there were 933 women per thousand males.
SNT.253499.10133	However, in the capital, Delhi, only 866 females were counted for every one thousand males.
SNT.253499.10134	Throughout the states of India, the population growth rate varies significantly.
SNT.253499.10135	This results in an inequality in the allocation of funds and is a problem, experts say.
SNT.253499.10136	According to Management Institute of Population and Development consultant Devendra Kothari: "Our federal government sends funds to the states according to their population."
SNT.253499.10137	"This means that the states that have worked harder to reduce their population growth get less money from New Delhi".
SNT.253499.10138	Kothari continued: "The states with lesser population send fewer members to the Indian parliament."
SNT.253499.10139	Over the course of the approaching year, concluding census figures will be publicised, according to officials.
SNT.123966.10140	300 millimeters (11.8 inches) of rain fell in six hours resulting in flash flooding on the New South Wales mid-north coast in Australia trapping thousands.
SNT.123966.10141	"We're looking at a flood that is around the one in one hundred year flood level," said Phil Campbell, State Emergency Service spokesperson.
SNT.123966.10142	Ambulance crews spent the night rescuing stranded residents caught off guard by the sudden deluge.
SNT.123966.10143	As many as 2,700 residents had been trapped by the floodwaters.
SNT.123966.10144	420 people sought refuge in evacuation centres over night, of these all but 70 have returned home.
SNT.123966.10145	The Red Cross flood evacuation centre in Urunga was left without power but still harbours 300 who sought refuge there.
SNT.123966.10146	Inland floodwaters trapped more than 1,000 residents in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales over night.
SNT.123966.10147	"It does seem likely that we'll need to make a natural disaster emergency declaration and that's something which obviously then brings some resources in."
SNT.123966.10148	"The most immediate challenge of course is for the 3,000 or so people who are still isolated and over 300 who are in evacuation centres at the moment."
SNT.123966.10149	Residents are being urged not to travel through the flooded areas.
SNT.123966.10150	Floodwaters are starting to recede, however the Bureau of Meteorology does not see an end to the heavy rains.
SNT.97851.10151	A Russian Proton-M/Briz-M carrier rocket launched this morning at 00:18 UTC, carrying the Ekspress AM-33 (also known as Express AM-33) communication satellite.
SNT.97851.10152	Launch, from area 200/39 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan took place on schedule, and the satellite was successfully placed into an intermediate transfer orbit.
SNT.97851.10153	Operations to place the satellite into its final Geosynchronous orbit, through further burns of the Briz-M upper stage, should have been completed, however no official announcement has yet been made.
SNT.97851.10154	This is the third orbital launch of 2008, and the first to be conducted by Russia.
SNT.97851.10155	The satellite will provide C, L and Ku-band communication services.
SNT.97851.10156	It has a mass of 2600kg, and an expected orbital lifetime of 12 years.
SNT.97851.10157	It was constructed by NPO PM and Thales Alenia Space, and will be operated by the Russian Space Communication Company, and RKA.
SNT.97851.10158	It will be placed in a geosynchronous orbit, about 36,000 kilometres above the Earth, at a longitude of 95.5°E.
SNT.97851.10159	It will replace the AM-11 satellite, which malfunctioned in 2006.
SNT.110682.10160	A 54-year-old German farmer who lost both arms in a farming accident six years ago has become the first patient to receive a complete double arm transplant.
SNT.110682.10161	In a press statement released by the clinic, it was revealed that the patient had been thoroughly physically checked and had psychological counselling prior to the surgery to ensure he was mentally stable enough to cope with the procedure.
SNT.110682.10162	Since completion of the surgery, the patient has been on immuno-suppressant drugs to prevent rejection of the new limbs.
SNT.110682.10163	Indications from the clinic suggest that the double attachment went well, although it could be up to 2 full years before the patient is able to move the arms.
SNT.110682.10164	The donor arms came from an unnamed teenager, who is believed to have died in a car accident.
SNT.3981.10165	Microsoft released today the final version of its new service, MSN Search.
SNT.3981.10166	The new features that are available include tabs that allow consumers to target searches to the Web, news, images, music, desktop or Microsoft Encarta.
SNT.44704.10167	A retired Canadian military major, Michel Pilon, saw the man and two of his friends urinate on the memorial at about 11 p.m. Saturday.
SNT.44704.10168	The man was photographed urinating on the National War Memorial in Ottawa.
SNT.44704.10169	The 23-year-old was pictured smiling and making a hand gesture toward the camera.
SNT.44704.10170	Ottawa police are looking for the 23-year-old Montreal man and his two friends, both under the age of 18.
SNT.44704.10171	"This is a shrine to people who fought for us in the wars."
SNT.44704.10172	They could be charged with public urination or behaving in an offensive manner, and fined $125 or required to do a day of community work.
SNT.174271.10173	Journalist, counselor, painter, and US 2012 Presidential candidate Joe Schriner of Cleveland, Ohio took some time to discuss his campaign with Wikinews in an interview.
SNT.174271.10174	Schriner previously ran for president in 2000, 2004, and 2008, but failed to gain much traction in the races.
SNT.174271.10175	He announced his candidacy for the 2012 race immediately following the 2008 election.
SNT.174271.10176	Schriner refers to himself as the "Average Joe" candidate, and advocates a pro-life and pro-environmentalist platform.
SNT.174271.10177	He has been the subject of numerous newspaper articles, and has published public policy papers exploring solutions to American issues.
SNT.174271.10178	Wikinews reporter William Saturn‎ talks with Schriner and discusses his campaign.
SNT.381597.10179	The People's Republic of China called on Syrian government forces and opposition in the Syrian uprising, such as the Free Syrian Army, to end the violence.
SNT.381597.10180	Previously, China has opposed two attempts at United Nations Security Council resolutions to control the violence in Syria and to ask for President Bashar al-Assad to resign.
SNT.381597.10181	While the Arab League, the European Union, Turkey, and the United States all have pursued sanctions against the regime in Syria, China so far has been against the removal of the Syrian regime and has rejected sanctions.
SNT.381597.10182	The former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan has been newly appointed as a Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League, which has been endorsed by the Chinese statement.
SNT.381597.10183	"The fact that aid is prevented and access is refused to United Nations officials constitutes another crime," the minister said.
SNT.381597.10184	The Red Cross had been denied access to the city of Homs.
SNT.381597.10185	China has usually hesitated to support international intervention in national situations, as when a United Nations resolution was invoked to support the bombing of Libya by NATO forces last year.
SNT.78386.10186	Yesterday, Republican Fred Thompson confirmed his campaign for the United States presidential election, 2008.
SNT.78386.10187	The much expected announcement comes on the tail of criticism about his lobbying past and that he has waited too long to declare his intentions.
SNT.78386.10188	He is expected to file papers next Thursday to make his candidacy official.
SNT.78386.10189	Thompson much expected declarations comes after months of "testing the waters."
SNT.78386.10190	Already appearing in the top tier of GOP candidates, Thompson's announcement comes after staff changes and lack luster fundraising.
SNT.78386.10191	According to an advisor, Thompson will make the announcement on Leno opting not to appear at the Republican debate on September 5.
SNT.106586.10192	David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative Party and UK leader of the opposition today made a speech to the conference of the Scottish Conservative Party.
SNT.106586.10193	In the speech he addressed the issue of Scottish independence.
SNT.106586.10194	"I want to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - all of it, including Scotland."
SNT.106586.10195	"I absolutely believe we are stronger together, and weaker apart, and I will do anything and everything to keep our two countries as one," he said.
SNT.106586.10196	"Whether we like it or not, the ugly stain of separatism is seeping through the Union flag," said Cameron, stating his opinion on the movements for Scottish independence.
SNT.106586.10197	"The simple truth is that the Union between England and Scotland is under attack as never before."
SNT.106586.10198	"To play games by calling for a referendum right at the moment when people would take any opportunity to give the most unpopular Government in living memory a good kicking, isn’t clever... isn’t good politics …isn’t defending the Union."
SNT.106586.10199	"The Union is in danger for other reasons too," he claimed.
SNT.106586.10200	"The number of people who think themselves British – ahead of Scottish or English - is in decline."
SNT.106586.10201	"Britishness is a matter of instinct, not calculation, and the sooner we have a Government that is willing to stand up for, and take pride in, that instinct then the sooner we can fight the forces of separation," continued Cameron, speaking to his supporters.
SNT.106586.10202	Cameron also addressed Scottish First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party:
SNT.106586.10203	I know you think a Conservative government at Westminster will ignore what Scotland wants and needs, and that you will use such claims to promote your separatist agenda.
SNT.106586.10204	And to the people of Scotland, I make this guarantee.
SNT.106586.10205	Whatever the outcome in Scotland of the next General Election, a Conservative Government will govern the whole of the United Kingdom, including Scotland, with respect.
SNT.86992.10206	Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi have released Beast Loose in Paradise - which will be the soundtrack to the band's upcoming horror movie Dark Floors - as a downloadable single.
SNT.86992.10207	The song was originally intended to be released via Zed.fi, but for unknown reasons has not appeared on the site.
SNT.86992.10208	However, it has appeared on at least two other sites as a pay-to-download single - MSN Music Finland and MTV3.fi.
SNT.86992.10209	The song was one of two recorded last month, and will be released by Sony BMG Finland as an actual CD on January 8 .
SNT.86992.10210	The other song, titled Studs and Leather, was also written for the movie.
SNT.86992.10211	The cover art for the CD single has already been revealed.
SNT.86992.10212	It is a direct tribute to the KISS album Creatures of the Night.
SNT.86992.10213	Most of both songs were composed during Lordi's tour of the United States as part of Ozzfest, with the band's lead vocalist saying in an interview with MonsterDiscoHell.com that the main riff of Beast Loose in Paradise was written in Milwaukee, while the chorus of Studs and Leather was composed in St. Augustine.
SNT.86992.10214	He went on to say that Studs and Leather had originally been intended for Bend over and Pray the Lord!, an unreleased album from 1999 that had been intended to be Lordi's debut.
SNT.86992.10215	The verses from Beast Loose in Paradise had been decided on between the whole band during therapy sessions at Christmas 2006.
SNT.86992.10216	He said that he had written most of the rest between two US tours, the Ozzfest tour and a tour as the support act for American gothic doom metal band Type O Negative.
SNT.86992.10217	He continued to deny a recent rumour posted in Finnish music periodical Soundi that the new material was going to be "more brutal and raw" than that on Lordi's last album, The Arockalypse.
SNT.86992.10218	"Our music is not gonna get any brutal or heavier, but not any lighter [either]..."
SNT.86992.10219	Although Beast Loose in Paradise is more 'movie-esque' and 'horror-ish' on purpose.
SNT.86992.10220	And some might say it's even heavier, but at the very least the chorus will be familiar and melodic Lordi stuff.
SNT.86992.10221	And Studs and Leather is basically Heaven's on Fire (KISS song) meets Balls To The Wall (Accept song).
SNT.239066.10222	A father and son from Romania have been found guilty of a string of prostitution-related offences in the United Kingdom.
SNT.239066.10223	For four years, Marius "Mario" Nejloveanu and father Bogdan trafficked women into and around the UK, forcing their victims into prostitution.
SNT.239066.10224	Nejloveanu, 23, was also convicted of a series of rapes and headed the business with guidance from his 51-year-old father.
SNT.239066.10225	Five women were lured from Romania, the youngest in her teens, the oldest 27, with promises of work and romance with Marius.
SNT.239066.10226	Originally founding a brothel in their hometown of Birmingham, the pair met resistance from local rival pimps and relocated the women to Manchester.
SNT.239066.10227	There, they worked six or seven days each week, sleeping in brothels and having sex with eight-to-ten men each night against their will.
SNT.239066.10228	Typical fees from customers were around £40 but some may have paid as low as £10.
SNT.239066.10229	Around half of each fee went to the Nejloveanus and half to the brothel.
SNT.239066.10230	Police launched raids, rescuing the women after receiving a tip-off.
SNT.239066.10231	Bogdan was accused by Rachel Smyth, prosecuting, of giving advice and assistance to Marius; Smyth opened the trial last year telling Manchester Crown Court "[h]aving heard the evidence you [the jury] may conclude that the son, Marius, learnt this trade from his father and that this was a family business."
SNT.239066.10232	The woman were "threatened, beaten and degraded" and faced "extreme sexual violence and humiliation," the court heard.
SNT.239066.10233	Bogdan was convicted of seven offences - three counts of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation, three counts of trafficking into the UK for sexual exploitation and controlling prostitution for gain.
SNT.239066.10234	Marius was found guilty of five counts of trafficking women into the UK for sexual exploitation, one count of conspiracy to traffic a woman into the UK for sexual exploitation, two counts of trafficking women within the UK for sexual exploitation, one count of trafficking a woman out of the UK for sexual exploitation, four counts of rape, five counts of assault, two counts of causing a woman to engage in sexual activity without consent, five counts of controlling prostitution for gain, and one count of witness intimidation to total 27 offences.
SNT.239066.10235	The duo join two others who admitted lesser roles in the scheme.
SNT.239066.10236	Costel Maruntelu, 24, was previously jailed for five years and six months for sex trafficking crimes.
SNT.239066.10237	Juanita "Toni" Huntingdon, 41, helped set up the Birmingham brothel and acted as a receptionist at both sites and entered guilty pleas to five counts of controlling prostitution for gain.
SNT.46931.10238	New Zealand Māori leaders have said that they will try to get a Maori temporary tattoo kit from the Los Angeles store Halloween Town withdrawn from sale, as they find it insulting to the Māori culture.
SNT.46931.10239	The Halloween Town, a store that specializes in Halloween costumes and accessories, is selling the tattoo kit for NZ$16.
SNT.46931.10240	The store's website features a photograph of a full facial Tā moko (Māori tattoo) instead of their usual caricatures.
SNT.46931.10241	Aroha Mead, Victoria University of Wellington Māori business lecturer said that the Tā moko is not frightening, "And he doesn't look scary to me – he looks quite handsome,", but added "There didn't appear to be much that Māori could do."
SNT.46931.10242	"No-one likes to see their culture being denigrated but we are aware that the moko is in the public domain."
SNT.46931.10243	Rotorua acedmic Ngahihi o te ra Bidois, who has a full facial moko, has asked the Halloween Town store to remove the tattoo kits.
SNT.46931.10244	"It is insulting ... what they are doing is not portraying Māori correctly," Bidois said.
SNT.46931.10245	A full-face moko is traditionally restricted to male Māori and is used to represent mana (prestige).
SNT.102079.10246	A series of explosions have hit an Albanian arms depot near Tirana, leaving at least 155 people injured.
SNT.102079.10247	Juela Mecani, spokesperson for Albamian PM Sali Berisha, said to Reuters "We do not know the exact number (of casualties) but we fear the worst for the three teams, each of 21 people, working there at the time."
SNT.102079.10248	The three teams referred to were dismantling obsolete munitions stored there, as part of a programme to remove Stalinist era arms and modernize the military in order to qualify for an invitation to join NATO next month.
SNT.102079.10249	Injured people have been rushed to hospitals amid ongoing explosions, which Interior Ministry spokesman Avni Neza says have prevented helicopters landing in the area.
SNT.102079.10250	The wounded are suffering from burns, concussion, broken limbs and shrapnel injuries.
SNT.102079.10251	Meanwhile, Neza says police and army units are attempting to reach the area in armored cars.
SNT.102079.10252	Albanian health minister Nard Ndoka said that the 155 known to be hospitalized so far had to make their way to nearby villages as the ongoing explosions had also prevented road ambulances reaching the scene.
SNT.102079.10253	Tirana Airport spokesman Arlinda Causholli said glass windows and doors at the airport, a few kilometers from the site, were shattered by the initial series of explosions.
SNT.102079.10254	"We evacuated passengers from the affected area and suspended flights for around 30 minutes," he said.
SNT.102079.10255	"Terrified people are leaving the area on foot along the highway, women and children…"
SNT.102079.10256	"Cars with broken windows have been abandoned on the highway."
SNT.102079.10257	Local media reports Tirana residents rushing to donate blood to help with the emergency.
SNT.102079.10258	Explosions were felt in Tirana and in Durres, 20km (12 miles) from the base.
SNT.102079.10259	In the nearby village of Gerdec, some residents fled to the hills, while others sought shelter in concrete bunkers built by late Stalinist leader Enver Hoxha.
SNT.102079.10260	The initial blast was heard 150km away in Macedonia and Serbia
SNT.66765.10261	Statoil ASA (Statoil), a Norwegian state-owned oil company, entered into an agreement Friday to purchase all outstanding common shares of the privately held Canadian firm, North American Oil Sands Corporation (NAOSC).
SNT.66765.10262	The deal is reported to be worth CAD2.2 billion in an all-cash transaction.
SNT.66765.10263	It manages 1,110 square kilometres of oil sands leases located in northern Alberta.
SNT.66765.10264	It is estimated that the NOASC oil sands hold approximately 2.2 billion barrels of oil reserves.
SNT.66765.10265	The company is planning to develop an extraction project and an upgrading facility.
SNT.66765.10266	When the project is completed, NAOSC expects it to produce over 200,000 barrels of bitumen per day.
SNT.66765.10267	The upgrading facility would then process the bitumen into synthetic crude oil.
SNT.66765.10268	The NAOSC board of directors has approved the bid from Statoil unanimously, and has recommended that its shareholders accept the offer.
SNT.66765.10269	Paramount announced Friday that it had entered into a lock-up agreement with Statoil, which calls for Paramount to sell its 30.9% interest in NAOSC to Statoil ASA for a cash deal worth approximately $682 million.
SNT.66765.10270	"We are impressed by the performance and competence held by the employees in NAOSC,” said Helge Lund, chief executive of Statoil.
SNT.66765.10271	“Combined with Statoil’s experience and commitment to prudent operations, we are well-positioned to develop the resources in a sustainable manner, creating value for Statoil and its shareholders."
SNT.66765.10272	Statoil suggests that the development plans for the NAOSC oil sands includes an application of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) technology, which, according to the company, leaves a smaller environmental footprint than strip mining.
SNT.66765.10273	Statoil admits, however, that heavy oil production, such as is required in the oil sands, is "energy intensive and challenging in an environmental perspective."
SNT.66765.10274	The company said it intends to capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its oil sands production and store it underground.
SNT.66765.10275	Under new environmental regulations announced Thursday by Canadian Environment Minister John Baird, companies that can't meet new intensity targets for CO2 emission reductions will be able to purchase offset credits or contribute to a technology fund, at an initial cost of $15 per tonne of emissions.
SNT.66765.10276	New plants would have three years before they were obligated to begin reducing their emissions.
SNT.66765.10277	However, Julia Langer, director of the World Wildlife Fund's global threats program, told the Globe and Mail that the initial exemptions for new plants and the technology fund contributions would undermine the government's new environmental plan.
SNT.66765.10278	"This is a regulatory plan that is geared to business as usual for the tar sands sector," said Langer.
SNT.66765.10279	The Statoil-NAOSC transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2007.
SNT.129520.10280	A civilian helicopter chartered by NATO has crashed while taking off from Kandahar International Airport in Afghanistan, killing sixteen.
SNT.129520.10281	The helicopter had been chartered from the Russian company Vertical-T and all the victims were civilians.
SNT.129520.10282	A NATO statement said that there was no obvious cause for the accident but hostile fire had been ruled out.
SNT.129520.10283	The airport serves as NATO's operating base for southern Afghanistan.
SNT.129520.10284	The crash comes just days after another civilian helicopter chartered for military activities crashed near Sangin Airbase in Helmand.
SNT.129520.10285	The Mil Mi-26 is believed to have been shot down; six Ukrainian civilians onboard and one Afghan girl on the ground were killed in the crash on Tuesday.
SNT.129520.10286	The helicopter had been taking supplies to a British military base.
SNT.129520.10287	Roads in Afghanistan are often difficult to traverse, so militaries often contract aircraft, especially from Russia, to transport troops and cargo between bases.
SNT.55746.10288	Fiji’s fourth coup in 20 years rose today as troops disarmed Fiji's only armed police unit.
SNT.55746.10289	This is the first step in the long expected military coup.
SNT.55746.10290	Fiji's president dissolved parliament on Tuesday and sanctioned the military to remove embattled Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, said New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark
SNT.55746.10291	Qarase, who is in his residence in Suva, said the military was staging a coup and he would not resign but would have to be forcibly removed from office.
SNT.55746.10292	"I am the democratically elected prime minister of the people of Fiji."
SNT.55746.10293	"I have been advised this morning that the president of Fiji has acted outside his constitutional powers and supported the removal of the democratic prime minister by the military," Clark said in a statement to the New Zealand parliament.
SNT.55746.10294	Acting Police Commissioner Moses Driver denied that any take over had occurred.
SNT.55746.10295	He said soldiers arrived to inspect police weapons, and were waiting for approval for that inspection.
SNT.55746.10296	Troops later surrounding the Nasova Police Academy in Suva demanding the handover of weapons, and occupied the main police station in Suva.
SNT.55746.10297	No shots were fired when the police were locked out.
SNT.55746.10298	At a news conference inside the main Suva barracks, Commander Frank Bainimarama said that police weapons were confiscated so that "dissidents" did not use them against the military.
SNT.55746.10299	There are also reports that military checkpoints are been set up around the capital.
SNT.55746.10300	There are approximately four roadblocks with 20 soliders at each.
SNT.55746.10301	Troops tried to arrest the Prime Minister of Fiji, Laisenia Qarase, in the afternoon by setting up a roadblock between Suva and the province where Mr Qarase was attending a meeting, but he escaped in a helicopter, and has since been in hiding.
SNT.55746.10302	The Prime Minister and his cabinet are understood to be in safe, secure places, and some of them separated for extra security.
SNT.55746.10303	The army kept up the pressure on Mr Qarase when he was later summoned to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo's residence.
SNT.55746.10304	Mr Qarase drove to the estate, but was told by soldiers at a roadblock outside that he would have to walk the rest of the way.
SNT.55746.10305	A witness inside the grounds said the prime minister, whose bodyguards were also disarmed by the military, refused and returned to his office.
SNT.55746.10306	Mr Qarase will make another attempt to meet President Iloilo on Tuesday morning.
SNT.55746.10307	Military chief Commander Frank Bainimarama had repeatedly threatened to remove Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's government unless it drops several pieces of legislation, including a bill that would grant amnesty to those involved in a coup in 2000.
SNT.55746.10308	Commander Bainimarama has laid allegations on PM Qarase of stalling his pledge of ditching of the controversial legislation.
SNT.55746.10309	He had earlier imposed a deadline of noon (0000GMT) on Friday, December 1 but that deadline was extended to today as there was the annual rugby game between the police and the military.
SNT.55746.10310	Commander Bainimarama is both an avid rugby fan and active church goer.
SNT.55746.10311	"I maintain my demands and the deadline still stands and I will make a commitment to my stand after the rugby match," he said.
SNT.55746.10312	Mr Qarase told Fiji radio on Monday morning that he remained in control and has called an emergency cabinet meeting for Tuesday.
SNT.55746.10313	Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs called for calm on Monday and for the military to return to negotiations with the government.
SNT.55746.10314	Local radio reported seven government vehicles used by ministers and parliament's Speaker had been confiscated by the military since Monday night.
SNT.55746.10315	Including New Zealand which has banned Commander Bainimarama from entering New Zealand except if he is attending political crises talks.
SNT.55746.10316	Helen Clark described the situation as "...it's a very disturbing situation."
SNT.55746.10317	Some of Commander Bainimarama's close family live in New Zealand.
SNT.55746.10318	Conditions on the street of Fiji are said to be mixed, with some apprehension.
SNT.55746.10319	The United Nations might discontinue use of Fijian soldiers in peacekeeping operations of which is a large source of Fiji's income.
SNT.55746.10320	The International Community have said they will discontinue aid to Fiji which is worth millions annually.
SNT.19626.10321	The City of Brampton in Ontario, Canada, and Marikina in the Philippines have recently been "twinned".
SNT.19626.10322	Both cities are roughly the same size, both have female mayors, both are near urban destinations (one of Toronto, the other Manila) and feel they can benefit economically with each other.
SNT.19626.10323	Mayor Susan Fennell of Brampton commented "This twinning agreement between Brampton and Marikina City will not only provide new and exciting economic possibilities, but it is an excellent chance to recognize and celebrate the Filipino community in Brampton."
SNT.19626.10324	"As one of Canada's most diverse cities, Brampton is home to more than 8,000 Filipino residents with a distinct culture, and I am pleased to be able to celebrate that culture with this agreement."
SNT.123625.10325	A Spanish court is considering opening a criminal investigation into whether six former George W. Bush administration officials gave legal cover for torture at Guantanamo Bay.
SNT.123625.10326	The prosecutor's office must issue a recommendation on the merits of the case and on whether the high court has jurisdiction to pursue it.
SNT.123625.10327	A response is expected by next month, and an official close to the case said it was "highly probable" it would go forward and lead to arrest warrants.
SNT.123625.10328	Spanish law allows the courts to pursue cases of torture and war crimes beyond Spanish borders.
SNT.123625.10329	But American legal experts said the warrants, if issued, would be a largely symbolic gesture and that the officials would likely not be arrested if they did not leave the United States.
SNT.123625.10330	The officials are accused of providing the framework of policies and legal opinions that justified torture at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and afforded no protection under the Geneva Convention to Al-Qaeda suspects.
SNT.123625.10331	"The charges as related to make make no sense," said Douglas J. Feith, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, who is one of the six accused former officials.
SNT.123625.10332	"They criticize me for promoting a controversial position that I never advocated."
SNT.123625.10333	The other officials are former Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff David Addington, Pentagon attorney William Haynes, and Justice Department officials John Yoo and Jay Bybee.
SNT.123625.10334	Defenders of the officials said their legal analyses, which were conducted immediately following the September 11 attacks, are now being unfairly second-guessed.
SNT.123625.10335	A Spanish human rights group called the Association for Dignity of Inmates filed the criminal complaint.
SNT.41398.10336	The Australian Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, has praised supermarket shoppers and operators for cutting three billion plastic bags from circulation during the past two years.
SNT.41398.10337	He said a report compiled by the Australian National Retailers Association, representing major supermarkets, showed that by the end of last year supermarkets had reduced their annual use of lightweight, single-use bags by 45 per cent compared with 2002.
SNT.41398.10338	"This is an enormous achievement by shoppers and supermarket management and a clear demonstration of a behavioural change by thousands of Australians," Senator Campbell said.
SNT.41398.10339	"The goal must be to stop plastic bags getting into the litter stream and spoiling Australia’s environment."
SNT.41398.10340	The Senator says the result came from entirely voluntary action – "no regulations, no levies or additional costs to shoppers."
SNT.41398.10341	"I am delighted that the major supermarkets are committed to achieving the 50 per cent goal by the end of this year."
SNT.41398.10342	"I also share their view that development of a viable degradable bag to replace existing lightweight plastic ones is a key to achieving further significant reductions."
SNT.41398.10343	Plastics have been widely used in Australia in the past few decades but environmentalists say plastic bags have had a devastating impact on the nation's natural environment.
SNT.41398.10344	According to Clean Up Australia plastic bags can take between 20 and 1000 years to break down.
SNT.41398.10345	Despite their recyclable nature, an estimated 6.67 billion or 36,700 tonnes of plastic bags are disposed of in landfill sites throughout Australia each year.
SNT.41398.10346	Many thousands of marine mammals and seabirds die every year around the world as a result of plastic litter.
SNT.41398.10347	A 2004 NSW Parliamentary paper reported that plastic bags are of "significant concern in the marine and aquatic environment, as aquatic life can be threatened through entanglement, suffocation and ingestion."
SNT.41398.10348	The then Federal Environment Minister was reported as saying: "All environmental ministers believe that all plastic bags should be phased out within five years."
SNT.41398.10349	"If this voluntary campaign isn’t working then of course we have to consider what to do (next)…."
SNT.75918.10350	Defense minister Søren Gade was there, having secretly flown into Iraq for the event.
SNT.75918.10351	During the ceremony, there was a rocket attack, causing everyone to hit the deck.
SNT.75918.10352	The 460 members of the army has already been reduced to 50 soldiers.
SNT.75918.10353	Denmark's contribution to the Multinational force in Iraq will now consist of a small air force unit of four helicopters and 55 airmen that will work with the British.
SNT.75918.10354	On July 20, Denmark said that it had airlifted translators and other Iraqi employees with their families.
SNT.75918.10355	In total it was about 200 people that by cooperating with MNF may be in danger of reprisals from insurgents.
SNT.75918.10356	"Out of concern for the interpreters and their families' security as well as the security of the Danish base in Iraq, the Defence Ministry has chosen to inform the public after the interpreters and others had left Iraq," the Danish Defence Ministry said in a statement.
SNT.75918.10357	"They had been working for us for about four years, and those who felt their security in Iraq was threatened have been granted visas to go to Denmark" where they can apply for asylum, the Danish ambassador to Iraq, Bo Eric Weber told Reuters.
SNT.75918.10358	Denmark announced in February that it would withdraw by August of this year.
SNT.333252.10359	On Friday, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) expanded its long-standing definition of rape to include men, and the rape of any gender by lack of consent — as opposed to physical coercion.
SNT.333252.10360	The revised definition should ensure all rapes are recorded in crime statistics.
SNT.333252.10361	Valerie Jarrett, a White House adviser, said it was a "very, very important step."
SNT.333252.10362	The new definition defines rape as: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."
SNT.333252.10363	Describing the changes to crime reporting as "long overdue", United States Attorney General Eric Holder said the revised definition of rape will, "help ensure justice for those whose lives have been devastated by sexual violence and reflect the Department of Justice's commitment to standing with rape victims".
SNT.333252.10364	The prior definition of rape — "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will" — was set by the FBI in 1927.
SNT.333252.10365	In contrast, the revised definition drops the requirement that there be physical resistance, thus including crimes where the victim is unable to give consent because they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or due to their age.
SNT.333252.10366	The changes are primarily a revision to the Uniform Crime Reports system (UCR), and are not expected to impact prior cases or current prosecutions.
SNT.333252.10367	Introducing no changes to current State or Federal law, the FBI expects the revised definition of rape will see victim numbers "more accurately reflected in national crime statistics".
SNT.333252.10368	Close to the revised rape definition is a 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which included male rape and non-consensual sex; their figures indicate that, at some point in their lives, about 20% of women and 1.5% of men in the United States have been raped.
SNT.333252.10369	Writing for Significance magazine, Stephanie Kovalchik says this report shows the US "is experiencing an epidemic of sexual violence."
SNT.333252.10370	Comparing with other CDC reports, she highlights "that [the] number of American women who have been raped is greater than the number who are current smokers."
SNT.333252.10371	Vice President Joe Biden, with a history of advocating improved rape legislation, described the changes as "a victory for women and men across the country whose suffering has gone unaccounted for over 80 years."
SNT.333252.10372	Whilst still in the Senate, Biden led efforts to implement legislative change — including authoring the Violence Against Women Act.
SNT.516039.10373	The Philippine economy grew by 5.9%, annual rate, during the second quarter of 2012 which is less than the first quarter's figure of more than 6% annual rate, as reported by The Associated Press.
SNT.516039.10374	According to Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, strong domestic demand from the services sector and spending from money remitted by expatriate Filipinos helped boost the nation's economy despite the ongoing global economic crisis.
SNT.516039.10375	In spite of this growth, numerous risks still lurk around the corner, said Balisacan.
SNT.516039.10376	He said that changes in China and the El Niño remain as the biggest challenges to the economy.
SNT.516039.10377	Balsican also noted that poor infrastructure may also have a negative impact although spending on infrastructure, which may cost nearly $200 million in investment, may contribute to growth.
SNT.516039.10378	The Philippines central bank has cut key interest rates three times already this year in order to continue this economic expansion.
SNT.516039.10379	Analysts, such as economist Eugene Leow of Singapore-based DBS bank, agree that, "There is definitely room to further cut rates if needed," in order to promote further growth.
SNT.26414.10380	Update November 21, 2005: All of the 14 miners missing were confirmed dead on Monday, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
SNT.26414.10381	Seven miners have been killed and seven more are missing after a coal mine flooded in north China's Hebei province.
SNT.26414.10382	The Xinhua news agency reports the latest coal mine disaster occurred around 5:00 a.m. on Saturday in Xingtai City.
SNT.26414.10383	A reason for the accident has not yet been given.
SNT.26414.10384	Owners of the coal mine have been detained by local police and the investigation into the cause of the flooding is underway.
SNT.26414.10385	State media reports say the disaster occurred at a pit in Xingtai City, but gave few other details.
SNT.26414.10386	China's mines, many of them illegal, are considered the world's most dangerous.
SNT.26414.10387	More than 6,000 miners died in accidents in China last year, according to previously released government figures.
SNT.26414.10388	Other independent estimates put the real figure at around 20,000.
SNT.26414.10389	Saturday's accident follows a gas explosion at a coal mine in south-western China's Guizhou province on Friday killing at least ten people.
SNT.26414.10390	Xinhua reports that rescue work is underway, according to the local work safety supervision bureau.
SNT.26414.10391	A spokesman said Yuanda Coal Mine, a collectively-owned mine in Neiqiu county of Xingtai, was flooded and all the 14 miners working down the pit were trapped.
SNT.26414.10392	This is the second fatal mine accident in the area in two weeks.
SNT.26414.10393	Cave-ins at three plaster mines on November 6 caused 33 deaths and left at least four missing.
SNT.150611.10394	The unemployment rate in the Eurozone, or the sixteen countries in which the euro is used, reached ten percent last December, for the first time since the euro was introduced in 1999.
SNT.150611.10395	A ten-percent jobless rate was initially recorded in November, although that was later revised down to 9.9%.
SNT.150611.10396	According to Eurostat, 15.8 million people now are without jobs in the Eurozone.
SNT.150611.10397	For all 27 countries in the European Union, 23 million people collectively are unemployed.
SNT.150611.10398	Eurostat reports that 87,000 jobs were lost throughout the eurozone in December, the smallest loss since May.
SNT.150611.10399	Latvia had the highest jobless rate for the EU, at 22.8%, whilst Spain has the highest for the eurozone, at 19.5%.
SNT.150611.10400	The two countries with the lowest unemployment rates were the Netherlands and Austria, with jobless figures of 4% and 5.4%, respectively.
SNT.150611.10401	An analyst for IHS Global Insight, Howard Archer, commented on the figures.
SNT.150611.10402	"Although the rise in eurozone unemployment has slowed in recent months, it still seems poised to trend higher during much, if not all, of 2010," he noted.
SNT.8739.10403	St. Petersburg, Florida police were taped on video handcuffing a five-year-old kindergarten student who had earlier torn papers off a bulletin board and punched an assistant principal.
SNT.8739.10404	The camera happened to be filming on March 14 as part of a classroom self-improvement exercise at Fairmount Park Elementary.
SNT.8739.10405	Video of the event has been released by a lawyer for the child's mother.
SNT.8739.10406	The little girl had already calmed down from her tantrum by the time of arrival of the police, but they cuffed her anyway.
SNT.8739.10407	Police had been called when a phone call to mother Inga Akins, had led teachers to believe that it would take an hour for Ms Akins to arrive and take the girl away.
SNT.8739.10408	The video reportedly shows three officers pin the passive girl's arms behind her back and put on handcuffs, as she screams, "No!"
SNT.8739.10409	Attorney for the mother, John Trevena, called the incident "incomprehensible".
SNT.8739.10410	He provided the tape to the media this week, after obtaining it from police.
SNT.8739.10411	"The image itself will be seared into people's minds when you have three police officers bending a child over a table and forcibly handcuffing her," said Mr Trevena.
SNT.8739.10412	Police planned to investigate the incident and make public the findings in around two weeks.
SNT.201587.10413	Western Australian district court judge Shauna Deane has found that a Muslim woman must remove her burqa in order to testify with regard to an Islamic school's alleged receiving of state and federal government funding in a fraudulent manner.
SNT.201587.10414	The woman, identified only as 'Tasneem', was deemed unable to wear her traditional coverings despite feeling uncomfortable removing them in public.
SNT.201587.10415	Judge Shauna Deane found that it would not be suitable for 'Tasneem' to offer evidence with her face covered, stating that the need to maintain a fair trial is consistent with allowing the jury to view and interpret cues from the face of a witness.
SNT.201587.10416	The judge went on to say that her findings should not set a precedent for future cases and that any future rulings regarding the facial and head coverings should be based on the independent findings of the judge hearing the case.
SNT.131009.10417	Leader of the Japanese opposition Democratic Party of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, won a majority of votes in the House of Representatives of Japan in the Japanese general election on Sunday.

SNT.131009.10421	It has been estimated that roughly 30% of LDP supporters voted for the victorious DPJ, mainly due to the current economic climate.
SNT.131009.10422	The Liberal Democratic Party was left with just 57 of 480 total seats.
SNT.131009.10423	Outgoing Prime Minister Taro Aso has promised to resign as party leader, saying, "I believe this is the judgement of the public and we have to accept that and reflect on what we did."
SNT.131009.10424	"The people have shown their disappointment with the party and I have to accept that as my destiny."
SNT.131009.10425	Aso also said that he will stay on as leader until a new one is chosen.
SNT.131009.10426	The Democratic Party has already informally allocated a number of cabinet positions and has set to work drafting improvements to the existing stimulus package.
SNT.131009.10427	The newly elected party also pledges to focus spending on households, especially rural families and those with children.
SNT.131009.10428	Tokyo economist Koichi Haji predicts that the hope instilled in the Japanese people by the election result will stimulate the economy, causing stock prices to rise.

SNT.96235.10430	United States President George Bush has arrived in Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to attempt to encourage support for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and U.S.-led efforts to contain Iran.
SNT.96235.10431	Mr. Bush is using this tour of the Middle East to ask Arab allies of the USA to provide diplomatic and financial backing to Palestinian leaders involved in negotiations with Israel.
SNT.96235.10432	In a speech on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the president also urged Gulf states to join Washington in confronting Iran, which he called "the world's leading state sponsor of terror."
SNT.96235.10433	Sunni Arab Gulf states have maintained relations with Iran despite their concerns about the Shi'ite country's regional influence.
SNT.96235.10434	Mr. Bush's talks with Saudi leaders also are expected to cover arms sales.
SNT.96235.10435	Before heading to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Bush visited Dubai briefly.
SNT.96235.10436	He told a round table of young Arab leaders there that America respects their religion and wants to work together in peace.
SNT.96235.10437	Sunday, in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Bush accused Iran of sending arms or financial support to militants in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.
SNT.96235.10438	Iran denies such allegations and accuses Washington of trying to spread anti-Iranian sentiment in the region.
SNT.96235.10439	According to many reporters George Bush has kept a strong relationship with the Saudi royal family, who are often considered as allies of the United States.

SNT.107669.10441	Seminars and forums always played key roles to forecast the future of ICT industry worldwide after the COMPUTEX became more and more critical for businesspeople.
SNT.107669.10442	Not only e21FORUM, the DRAMeXchange Compuforum was progressively respected by DRAM industry since 2006.
SNT.107669.10443	Since the mobile devices have become popular in the presence, the supply of DRAM modules is still inadequate to meet the demand.
SNT.107669.10444	"The abandonment of 12-inch fabs and the suspension of 8-inch fabs are considered critical issues in this incident."
SNT.107669.10445	"If the Mainland China wants to enlarge its market stably, the supply chain and costs of material should be cautioned."
SNT.107669.10446	Mass storage devices with high capacity often linked with enterprises.
SNT.107669.10447	With innovations of information technology, capacity of USB flash drives and mobile drives are larger and larger.
SNT.107669.10448	"Capacity, costs of production, prices, and efficiency on writing and reading are critical factors to determine an user on choosing SSDs, hard disks, or flash drives."

SNT.63086.10450	The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed in a news release, March 21, 2007, that two Royal Navy crew members had been killed in an accident aboard nuclear submarine HMS Tireless earlier in the day.
SNT.63086.10451	The next of kin for both men have been informed.
SNT.63086.10452	Another submariner had been injured and was airlifted to a United States military hospital for treatment.
SNT.63086.10453	The accident occurred at 4:20 a.m., March 21, on board HMS Tireless, a Trafalgar class submarine, during a joint US-UK exercise in the Arctic.
SNT.63086.10454	The MoD suggested that the accident involved a piece of air-purification equipment in the forward section of the submarine.
SNT.63086.10455	The submarine was not in danger and its nuclear reactor was unaffected.
SNT.63086.10456	HMS Tireless is a hunter-killer submarine and does not carry nuclear missiles.
SNT.63086.10457	HMS Tireless was submerged under the ice cap at the time of the incident.
SNT.63086.10458	The crew brought the submarine to surface quickly through the ice.
SNT.63086.10459	The Tireless was fitted, in 2001, with an update to the piece of air-purification machinery thought to have failed.
SNT.63086.10460	As a precaution, the MoD is restricting its use on other boats until safety checks have been carried out.
SNT.63086.10461	"I very much regret that this incident has occurred and my thoughts go out to the family and friends of the men who have lost their lives," said Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent, Commander-in-Chief Fleet.
SNT.63086.10462	He added, "I also wish to pay tribute to the crew of HMS Tireless that this incident has been dealt with and contained so professionally."
SNT.63086.10463	It was not stated what the official cause of death was.
SNT.101080.10464	The website wikileaks.org has recently been brought back online following the lifting of a court injunction forcing the site to be taken down.
SNT.101080.10465	A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which supported Wikileaks, has told Wikinews their opinion of the court injunction.
SNT.101080.10466	They have claimed that the lifting of the injunction was a "victory for the first amendment."
SNT.101080.10467	The representative stated that the ACLU hopes this injunction acts as an example to other judges who take part in similar cases.
SNT.101080.10468	This opinion was shown when the representative said that the lifting of the injunction will "hopefully help show other courts that injunctions against speech, including speech on the Internet, are not appropriate."
SNT.101080.10469	The permanent injunction was granted in the California Northern District Court in San Francisco, California to Bank Julius Baer, a Swiss bank, which has caused the domain to be taken off line in the U.S..
SNT.101080.10469-1	Wikileaks previously published several documents obtained from a whistleblower of the Swiss Bank, "purportedly showing offshore tax evasion and money laundering by extremely wealthy and in some cases, politically sensitive, clients from the United States, Europe, China and Peru."
SNT.101080.10470	"Blocking access to the entire site in response to a few documents posted there completely disregards the public's right to know," said Ann Brick a lawyer for the ACLU, in a statement made before the injunction was lifted.
SNT.101080.10471	At least 18 other organizations have signed documents in defense of Wikileaks.
SNT.101080.10472	Those documents have been forged into a joint amicus curiae ("friend of the court") brief; which will be submitted to the court and used as defense evidence in a hearing scheduled for Friday February 29.
SNT.248846.10473	Che Guevara's "Motorcycle Diaries" companion dies
SNT.248846.10473-1	 Both were intellectually curious and interested in exploration.
SNT.248846.10474	In 1951 they set out on an eight-month motorcycle trip through South American that exposed them to the poverty in which most South Americans lived.
SNT.248846.10475	The pair worked in a leprosy colony and met wtih destitute miners and indigenous people.
SNT.248846.10476	Both men kept diaries which served as the basis for the 2004 film, The Motorcycle Diaries, produced by Robert Redford and directed by Walter Salles.
SNT.248846.10477	According to the Guardian, "Their road trip awoke in Guevara a social consciousness and political convictions that would turn him into one of the iconic revolutionaries of the 20th century."
SNT.248846.10478	The trip is widely believed to have inspired Guevara to go to Cuba and join Fidel Castro in his 1959 revolt against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.
SNT.248846.10479	By the time the two men met again eight years later, Guevara was a revolutionary hero and chief of Cuba’s central bank.
SNT.248846.10480	Jiménez, who had remained in Argentina working in a clinic, accepted Guevara's invitation to move to Cuba in 1961 and founded a medical facility in Santiago.
SNT.248846.10481	Later he moved to Havana where he continued his medical work.
SNT.248846.10482	The two remained friends although they did not always agree.
SNT.248846.10483	Jiménez rejected Guevara’s belief that social reform in Latin America had to be accomplished through guerrilla warfare.
SNT.248846.10484	The book The Motorcycle Diaries was published in the 1990's.
SNT.32374.10485	On Tuesday the 31st of January, Dr Don Brash, the leader of the New Zealand National Party gave his third state of the nation speech to the Orewa Rotary Club where he focussed on the economy.
SNT.32374.10486	Brash said business confidence in New Zealand is at its lowest level in 30 years and almost every day there is another company closing its doors or sharply reducing its staff.
SNT.32374.10487	He predicted that "many businesses will face very tough times, and that unemployment will rise steeply."
SNT.32374.10488	Brash said the blame for any recession will lie squarely with the Prime Minister Helen Clark and Labour.
SNT.32374.10489	Brash said he had hoped to return as Prime Minister to give this speech.
SNT.32374.10490	He also said that he intends to lead National in the next New Zealand general election (2008) and would be surprised if he is replaced before then.
SNT.32374.10491	He also claimed the speech was riddled with inaccuracies, particularly over Government spending.
SNT.32374.10492	Brash's first speech at Orewa, delivered by Brash on 27 January 2004, was highly controversial.
SNT.32374.10493	It addressed the theme of race relations in New Zealand, particularly the special status of Māori, New Zealand's indigenous ethnic group.
SNT.32374.10494	Some regard the speech as a watershed moment in New Zealand politics.
SNT.120989.10495	German rock and metal label GUN Records (Great Unlimited Noises) announced Friday that they were to close.
SNT.120989.10496	Formed as a joint venture between BMG and Wolfgang Funk in 1992, the label had seen its parent merge with Sony in 2005 to form Sony BMG and Funk quit as president in December 2008.
SNT.120989.10497	In the nineties the label worked with German metal bands such as U.D.O., Sodom and Running Wild.
SNT.120989.10498	GUN's current international acts - including Wales' Bullet for My Valentine, Finland's Lordi and the Netherlands' Within Tempatation - will now be handled out of Sony's Munich international division.
SNT.120989.10499	National artists, such as Oomph! and The Donots, will also be Sony's direct responsibility via either Four Music or Columbia Germany in Berlin.
SNT.120989.10500	The label has also worked with Sturm und Drang, Apocalyptica and HIM.
SNT.120989.10501	The closure will affect eight employees including Arno Hartfield, the managing director.
SNT.28585.10502	San Jose, California mayor Ron Gonzales is being investigated by the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office.
SNT.28585.10503	Gonzales is accused of secretly agreeing to pay $11 million in city funds to waste disposal company Norcal Waste Systems, without notice or approval by the city council.
SNT.28585.10504	The scandal has already resulted in an independent investigation, civil grand jury proceedings, Gonzales's censure by the council, and council members calling for his resignation or removal from office.
SNT.28585.10505	In a statement responding to the DA's investigation, Gonzales announced he has hired Allen Ruby, a high-profile Silicon Valley attorney, to represent him in this matter.
SNT.28585.10506	Ruby has previously represented the National Football League in lawsuits against Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis.
SNT.28585.10507	Gonzales's statement also supported the decision of the DA to conduct further investigations into the city's contract.
SNT.53530.10508	The mother of a firefighter who died in his duties fighting the blaze in southern California, has pleaded to the arsonist responsible for the 40,450 acre inferno to give himself up, and that she will not judge him.
SNT.53530.10509	Bonnie McKay, mother to 27-year-old Jason McKay, said "I firmly believe you didn't believe that things were going to turn out the way they did, but they did."
SNT.53530.10510	The fire, which has claimed the lives of four firefighters and caused 95% burns to a fifth, is now 60% contained.
SNT.53530.10511	There is a massive aerial attack on the fire in progress, making use of fire helicopters and planes to dump thousands of gallons of water onto the blaze over the canyons of Riverside County.
SNT.53530.10512	The blaze has now destroyed as many as 27 homes, and has forced the evacuation of 500 more.
SNT.197937.10513	A huge wildfire that has been burning in the High Desert of Southern California since 2:00 pm (2200 UTC) yesterday continues to threaten residents in the city of Palmdale in the Antelope Valley region of the Los Angeles County this afternoon.
SNT.197937.10514	Mandatory evacuation orders have been set in place, affecting 2,000 homes.
SNT.197937.10515	The fire is one of three that ignited yesterday in the Mojave Desert and San Gabriel Mountains.
SNT.197937.10516	The first was a 30-acre fire that began to the west of Lancaster in the Fairmont area.
SNT.197937.10517	It was contained and suppressed by mid-afternoon, but the other two fires ignited while firefighters were battling the first.
SNT.197937.10518	The second fire, the "Briggs Fire", began shortly after 2:00 pm near 8334 Soledad Canyon Road and Briggs Road, south of the freeway.
SNT.197937.10519	It burned 500 acres south of the 14 Freeway, but the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) now has it contained, and firefighters are hopeful that it will burn itself out as it edges closer to the 160,577-acre burn area of last year's Station Fire.
SNT.197937.10520	The third fire, the "Crown Fire", broke out at around the same time as the Briggs Fire on the northern side of the 14 Freeway near Acton.
SNT.197937.10521	The Crown fire has so far burned 13,000 acres and has been heading north into Leona Valley and Palmdale.
SNT.197937.10522	Over 800 firefighters are now tackling the Crown Fire on the ground, Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fixed-wing aircraft have taken to the skies to drop Phos-Chek slurry (a red powdery fire retardant that is a mixture of mostly water and fertilizer, and doesn't evaporate) on the fire, and modified Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters known as "Firehawks" are making water-drops.
SNT.197937.10523	As well as LACFD, firefighters from Los Angeles City Fire Department, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are also helping to battle the fire.
SNT.197937.10524	Weather conditions and topography have hindered their efforts, as temperatures rose to 98 degrees Fahrenheit today, with windspeeds of 25mph.
SNT.197937.10525	Tonight, the National Weather Service predicts winds will reach as high as 50mph.
SNT.197937.10526	The fire burned down a Los Angeles County Sheriff Department communications tower, forcing Lancaster and Palmdale-based deputies to set up mobile operations bases and coordinate their efforts using cell phones and computers.
SNT.197937.10527	Last night, the California Aqueduct acted as a barrier to the fire.
SNT.197937.10528	Residents of Leona Valley, Lake Elizabeth, Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde and Palmdale received Reverse 911 telephone calls last night alerting them of mandatory evacuations.
SNT.197937.10529	Many of the evacuation orders were lifted this morning as the spread of the fire decreased.
SNT.197937.10530	However, as winds picked up in the afternoon, fire embers were carried across the aqueduct and the fire is now heading towards a highly-populated area of Palmdale.
SNT.197937.10531	Residents who were allowed back into their homes were re-evacuated to Red Cross shelters set up in local schools and parks.
SNT.197937.10531-1	The fire is also threatening five high-voltage power lines that supply electricity to much of Southern California.
SNT.197937.10532	21 customers in the immediate vicinity have been without power since yesterday.
SNT.197937.10533	At 5:00 pm, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, police and fire officials held a press conference.
SNT.197937.10534	The governor said that the fire was 20% contained and had burned 13,000 acres.
SNT.197937.10535	It is thought that the fire began when workers in Agua Dulce caused sparks by hammering the bolts when they were removing a tire from a rim.
SNT.126663.10536	Bingu wa Mutharika, the president of the African country of Malawi, was inaugurated on Friday after having been reelected to a second five-year term.
SNT.126663.10537	The Malawian election commission had earlier reported that wa Mutharika had won the election, having taken 2.7 million votes, more than twice than the 1.3 million votes received by the second place contestant, John Tembo.
SNT.126663.10538	In a statement at his inauguration ceremony, Mutharika said one of his highest priorities would be to battle with corruption.
SNT.126663.10539	"I shall continue to fight corruption because it is evil."
SNT.126663.10540	"Corruption in whatever form or shape is an enemy to growth and prosperity because it robs the poor, and denies their legitimate right to development."
SNT.126663.10541	He also promised to focus on food security and agriculture.
SNT.126663.10542	"In the next five years my administration will continue to prioritize agriculture and food security," the president said.
SNT.126663.10543	"We will remain committed in ensuring that our current food production levels increase further to sustain the country's food self-sufficiency."
SNT.126663.10544	The opposition has contested the election results and boycotted the president's inauguration.
SNT.126663.10545	"These elections have been rigged," opposition leader John Tembo said.
SNT.126663.10546	He has said he will challenge the election's outcome in court.
SNT.2397.10547	December 29, 2004 The death toll from the earthquake and tsunamis that has hit countries in Asia and Eastern Africa continues to rise, passing 80,000 people according to reports from several news agencies.
SNT.2397.10548	A spokesman for the Red Cross speculated that the toll could increase to over 100,000 as some of the smaller islands in the Indian Ocean are checked, and a U.N. official said that the death toll might eventually approach 80,000 in Indonesia alone.
SNT.2397.10549	The immediate fatalities from the earthquake and resulting tsunamis are but a fraction of the total effect from the disaster.
SNT.2397.10550	The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 5 million people lack food, water or basic sanitation necessary for survival.
SNT.2397.10551	Officials continue to struggle with burying the dead and delivering basic suvival provisions to the population in the coastal and island areas most hit by the disaster.
SNT.81797.10552	Round 6 of the Hyundai A-League produced an interesting first for the competition in its short existence, and something which has been totally against the grain so far this season.
SNT.81797.10553	In the 20 games so far this season, only three home wins had been recorded, but for the first time ever in the league, all four home teams won their respective matches in a single round.
SNT.81797.10554	The Mariners stay four points clear at the top despite losing its first game of the season against Adelaide, while Wellington had their first taste of victory at home, with the Phoenix smashing Perth 4-1.

SNT.52139.10556	At least 30 explosions have gone off inside the "Green Zone" in Baghdad, Iraq where the United States Embassy is located and where many Iraqi Government buildings are housed.
SNT.52139.10557	Iraqi military officials said no evacuations of residents were ordered from the Dora area.
SNT.52139.10558	The explosions are believed to be the result of a fire which broke out inside the Forward Operating Base Falcon, a U.S. ammunitions depot inside the zone, but it is not known if the fire was started due to an attack.
SNT.52139.10559	It's in our operating base in the Rasheed area of the city.
SNT.52139.10560	"The ammunition holding area contains tank and artillery rounds as well as small arms ammunition," said Lieutenant Colonel of the 4th Infantry Division, Jonathan Withington.
SNT.52139.10561	"[We are] trying to determine the cause or any threat to the population," said U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col, Christopher C. Garver.
SNT.52139.10562	Reports say that flares and helicopters could be seen coming from and into the zone.
SNT.52139.10563	So far, there are no reports of any deaths or injuries.
SNT.103003.10564	The United States Army has suspended its contract with a company that delivered old and corroding ammunition from China for use by Afghan army and police forces in a way that violated the contract terms.
SNT.103003.10565	The ammunition was supplied by the Miami-based AEY Inc., a company run by a 22-year old named Efrain Diveroli.
SNT.103003.10566	The nearly US$300 million contract stated that bullets were coming from Hungary, but were actually decades-old, damaged and corroded bullets from China.
SNT.103003.10567	Officials from the Army Legal Services Agency notified Diveroli, via a letter, that his company is suspended from future contracting with any U.S. government agency.
SNT.103003.10568	The letter came as part of an Army investigation since November regarding violation of the contract.
SNT.103003.10569	According to the New York Times, Diveroli signed papers back on November 25, 2007 certifying that 28 pallets of ammunition for Afghanistan had been manufactured by MFS 2000, a Hungarian company, according to a memo written by investigators.
SNT.103003.10570	AEY violated the contract by breaking two clauses, one stating that the ammunition could not be acquired directly or indirectly from the People’s Republic of China, which is a violation of American law.
SNT.103003.10571	The other clause specified that it must be packaged to comply with best commercial practices for international shipment.
SNT.103003.10572	According to the Times, says the ammunition arrived in decomposing cardboard boxes which contained ammunition dating as far back as 1966.
SNT.103003.10573	However, Army officials believe some ammunition even dates back further to 1962.
SNT.103003.10574	The Army had contracted with AEY in January 2007 to supply various types of nonstandard ammunition for use by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, an Army official said on background.
SNT.103003.10575	The company was required to purchase the ammunition and deliver it to Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan.
SNT.103003.10576	AEY was recently awarded a delivery order amount of $48,717,553 on March 17, 2007 as part of the $298,004,398 contract.
SNT.103003.10577	Also according to the Times, when purchasing the ammunition, AEY worked with middlemen and a shell company which has been placed on federal list of entities suspected of illegal arms trafficking.
SNT.103003.10578	Also, the Times reported that, Diveroli was secretly recorded in conversation that suggested corruption on his company's purchase of 100 million aging rounds from Albania.
SNT.103003.10579	Bryan Whitman, The Pentagon's spokesperson told reporters that suspension of the contract was due to the violation of the origin of the ammunition and the packaging of the ammunition, not the safety and performance.
SNT.103003.10580	“Safety and performance has not apparently been a factor, according to our folks in Afghanistan."
SNT.103003.10581	”They have had no safety incidents reported and no reports of any ammunition that has malfunctioned associated with this particular contract,” Whitman told the press.
SNT.103003.10582	He also denied that the issue happened because the Army awarded the contract to the lowest bidder and that he was not aware of AEY's qualifications to fulfill the contract.

SNT.79850.10620	"This signals the transformation of the Islamic militants trying to bring down [Pakistani President Pervez] Musharraf from rag-tag fighters to highly skilled insurgents able to attack at will," a diplomatic observer said last night.
SNT.79850.10621	"It is an extremely worrying development from the point of view of Musharraf and those who support him."
SNT.79850.10622	Observers have expressed concern at the fact that the bomber was able to successfully attack such a high-profile and heavily guarded target as the headquarters, especially considering the building's close proximity to the Tarbela Dam generator, considered an important strategic asset.
SNT.79850.10623	“Obviously, this was someone who was known and familiar to the soldiers there, and it could be one of the civilians working at the base.”

SNT.29207.10667	"Consumer confidence continues to bounce back and is now at its highest level since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center.
SNT.29207.10668	Most of the change is attributed to falling gas prices and an improved job outlook.
SNT.29207.10669	"The resiliency of the economy, recent declines in prices at the pump, and job growth have consumers feeling more confident at year-end than they felt at the start of 2005," Franco said.
SNT.29207.10670	"Even though all of the improvement over the past twelve months has been in consumers' assessment of current conditions, and expectations remain below earlier levels, consumers are confident that the economy will continue to expand in 2006."
SNT.131148.10671	The Greater Manchester town of Rochdale has begun setting up decorations for a number of festivities, including Eid, a Muslim holiday.
SNT.131148.10672	However, there's a twist—in order to save money, the town is also erecting Christmas decorations early.
SNT.131148.10673	Among the decorations were a giant Noel sign, holly leaves, and a skiing penguin.
SNT.131148.10674	Some residents were opposed to the move; one person said, "Seeing the lights makes me feel depressed."
SNT.131148.10675	"I know we haven't had much of a summer, but let's get it out of the way first".
SNT.131148.10676	"It's the height of summer and they're putting up Christmas lights."
SNT.131148.10677	"A worker told me they had to be up in time for all the religious festivals, but most of the lights refer to the Christian Christmas."
SNT.131148.10678	A spokeswoman for the Rochdale borough council said, "We understand that we're early putting Christmas lights up now, but we are merely putting them up and not switching them on."
SNT.131148.10679	"We have a duty to save taxpayers' money, and by putting them up now with lights for other festivities – including Eid in September – we will be saving around £10,000".
SNT.60403.10680	Recent tests have shown that an inexpensive drug may be able to kill cancer cells in humans.
SNT.60403.10681	Dichloroacetate, a drug generally used to treat rare metabolic disorders, has shown the potential to assist in the treatment of brain, lung, and breast cancers, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada say.
SNT.60403.10682	Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada found that that DCA causes tumor regressions in animals with human cancers.
SNT.60403.10683	Testing showed that DCA attacked cancer cells but did not attack healthy cells.
SNT.60403.10684	The researchers and the Alberta Cancer Board and Capital Health do not advise the use of DCA to treat cancer yet, as clinical trials for the drugs use to treat cancer have not been performed yet.
SNT.60403.10685	Unlike healthy cells, cancerous cells do not convert food molecules into energy in the mitochondria.
SNT.60403.10686	Instead, they rely on a process known as glycolysis, which takes place in the main body of the cell, while the mitochondria are "shut down", researchers believe possibly due to the lack of oxygen supply to cells in the middle of a tumor.
SNT.60403.10687	This means that another key function of the mitochondria - to activate an abnormal cell's self-destruct mechanism, apoptosis - is also blocked.
SNT.60403.10688	When Dichloroacetate (DCA) enters a cancer cell, it restarts the mitochondria which in turn activate apoptosis, and the cancerous cell destroys itself.
SNT.60403.10689	DCA is known to be relatively safe, although pain, numbness and gait disturbances may occur.
SNT.60403.10690	The drug is also expected to be cheaper to manufacture than other drugs since there is no patent for it.
SNT.89134.10691	A bomb exploded Tuesday night in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.
SNT.89134.10692	The bomb may have targeted a high-profile individual, traveling through the high-security zone in the Colombo Fort area.
SNT.89134.10693	Earlier in the day, a government minister was killed by a roadside bomb.
SNT.89134.10694	This blast has been blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) by government officials.
SNT.89134.10695	The deputy director of the government teaching hospital in the town of Ragama, Lalini Gurusinghe, announced the death of the minister.
SNT.89134.10696	The explosion took place in Ja-Ela, a town some 12 miles north of Colombo.
SNT.127534.10697	The AHLC (Ad-hoc Liaison Committee) met in Oslo, Norway on June 7 and 8 to discuss the Palestinian economical situation in Oslo.
SNT.127534.10698	Its mission is to bring the key donors of aid and relief together with the Israeli and Palestinian governments to address the current state of affairs between the two countries.
SNT.127534.10699	The AHLC keeps track on how donor countries interact with the Palestinian authorities and how the support they provide is handled.
SNT.127534.10700	Early on the first day, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Palestinian Prime minister Salam Fayyad both expressed optimism and hope for the Palestinian situation.
SNT.127534.10701	Minister Støre underlined the importance of continuing aid, but stated that he understood that most countries still had problems because of the world economic crisis.
SNT.127534.10702	As for the unstable political situation in Palestine, Prime Minister Fayyad explained that "the political instability is also a reason why we need more aid."
SNT.127534.10703	During the second day, a press conference with Minister Støre clarified the motives of the donations saying, "It’s is important to stress that donors are not doing this as a humanitarian project."
SNT.127534.10704	Our donor aid is a political project aim[ed] at supporting and sustaining the Palestinian Authority, a key institution in what is supposed to become an independent Palestinian state.
SNT.127534.10705	Minister Støre continued, stating, "It’s very important to stress that without a political horizon what we do as donors becomes less meaningful."
SNT.127534.10706	"So the current states of affairs where the political horizon is unclear and where we don’t have political negotiations of the two states as previous commitments indicates and obligate the party’s."
SNT.127534.10707	"Donors start to change their stand and other agendas get the upper hand."
SNT.127534.10708	"So in 2009 at this present stage, donors have only delivered half the amount they had at this time last year."
SNT.127534.10709	"You can leave that up to the financial crisis, but at the big donor conferences in Paris December 2007, and Sharm el-Sheikh February 2009 there were pledges enough to carry this through."
SNT.127534.10710	On the question if the donor countries had offered to give any immediate financial relief, Minister Støre said "This has to be stressed, [this] has not been a pledging conference."
SNT.127534.10711	"This has not been a donor conference where governments have been invited to come and make new pledges, as I said if everybody lived by their Paris pledges in December 2007, which were three year pledges, we are exactly half way in that, we would have been more or less fine."
SNT.127534.10712	"But I think we have seen a forthcoming approach by some delegations, I will not name them or put a figure on it but I think it follows from what the prime minister and I have together have expressed here that there is an urgent need."
SNT.127534.10713	A new meeting has been scheduled for September in New York, New York in conjunction with the United Nations General Assembly.
SNT.119456.10714	22 million counterfeit cigarettes have been found in Cardiff, Wales by officials working for HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).
SNT.119456.10715	They had an estimated value of five million GBP and impersonated the Classic Gold and Raquel brands of cigarette.
SNT.119456.10716	The details of the discovery, which took place on December 19 last year, has only just been made public.
SNT.119456.10717	The HMRC have stated that they have worked to find the source of the illegal products during the time since the discovery was made.
SNT.119456.10718	The assistant director of criminal investigation for the organisation, Andrew Pavlinic, explained the reasons for this.
SNT.119456.10719	"Had it been successful, it would have undermined the business of honest traders who only sell duty paid tobacco products," he continued.
SNT.119456.10720	"The sheer quantity involved in this attempt suggests these cigarettes could have ended up in locations across the UK."
SNT.119456.10721	"We have prevented UK consumers from being conned into buying cigarettes that are counterfeit and could have more serious risk to health than legitimate brands."
SNT.119456.10722	The discovery was the largest hoard of cigarettes found by custom officials in the whole of 2008, although several other significant stashes were found throughout the year.
SNT.119456.10723	For example, nine million counterfeit cigarettes were found in Suffolk in August, and eight million were found in Belfast in May.
SNT.18220.10724	A truck carrying 35,500 pounds (16,100 kg) of explosives used in mining and seismic exploration overturned and exploded on a rural mountain section of U.S. Highway 6 in Utah's Spanish Fork Canyon Thursday afternoon.
SNT.18220.10725	The wreck occurred shortly after 2 pm, as driver Travis Stewart, 30, of Rexburg, Idaho, was leaving Ensign-Bickford Co., a commercial explosives manufacturing plant at the mouth of the canyon.
SNT.18220.10726	Witnesses said Mr. Stewart appeared to lose control of the truck after entering a curve in the road at a high rate of speed.
SNT.18220.10727	Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Ken Peay said, "speed was a factor" in the wreck of the truck but refused to speculate on how fast the truck was traveling when it wrecked.
SNT.18220.10728	Lt. Peay said the posted speed limit on the road is 60 mph, but the advised speed is 40.
SNT.18220.10729	At least 17 people received minor injuries and the explosion left a 35 foot deep crater in the highway.
SNT.18220.10730	The driver was transported via helicopter to a hospital, where he was listed in fair condition, and was later released.
SNT.18220.10731	The co-driver Troy Lysfjord, 37, of Blackfoot, Idaho, was helped from the wreck by passers by and listed in fair condition at Utah Valley Regional Hospital in Provo.
SNT.18220.10732	The wreck site occurred on a major thoroughfare between Denver and Salt Lake City - about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City - was already under reconstruction by nightfall, as road crews began installing 10 inches of asphalt on the two lane road.
SNT.18220.10733	Utah Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Hudachko said officials hoped to have the road fully repaired by Friday afternoon, adding that, "When you take a look at that hole that was there 24 hours ago, I think it's amazing the progress that was made."
SNT.18220.10734	As of press time, the mouth of the canyon was reopened to traffic, while traffic at the accident site was impassible, and rerouted nearby.
SNT.18220.10735	The explosion consumed all but about 60 pounds of explosives, and loosened some boulders on the north side of the highway, damaged railroad tracks and some fiber optic lines buried along the roadway.
SNT.18220.10736	Amtrak and Union Pacific reported delays resulting from the wreck.
SNT.18220.10737	Uinta National Forest spokesman Loyal Clark said forest firefighters were unable to respond to several small fires nearby that were apparently started by flying debris, and that helicopters dropped water to extinguish them.
SNT.18220.10738	High humidity and lack of fuel from a previous fire delayed the fire's spread.
SNT.18220.10739	The cost of repairs, while paid immediately by the state, will ultimately be borne by the trucking company's insurance carrier.
SNT.18220.10740	The truck is registered to R&R Trucking of Duenweg, Missouri.
SNT.18220.10741	UHP Lt. Peay said the investigation findings will be turned over to Utah County Attorney Kay Bryson whom would make any final decision about what charges, if any, would be pressed.
SNT.32902.10742	The looming debate on whether the Australian Health Minister Tony Abbott or the Theraputic Goods Administration (TGA) should regulate mifepristone, RU486, has entered the Australian Senate, February 8.
SNT.32902.10743	A free vote is due to be conducted on this issue.
SNT.32902.10744	The first speakers have been all women speaking in support of passing control from the Health Minister to the TGA: Australian National Party Senator Fiona Nash, Australian Democrats Senator Lyn Allison, Australian Labor Party Senator Claire Moore.
SNT.32902.10745	They have drawn attention to the fact that abortion is already legal in Australia, the inappropriateness of a Parliament minister to regulate a single drug versus a scientific and independent body, and if RU486 is an unsafe drug then the TGA will not approve the drug.
SNT.32902.10746	Petitions were presented by Moore with the undersigned stating "medical experts, not the health minister" should regulate the drug.
SNT.32902.10747	Australian Liberal Party Senator Gary Humphries then spoke, stating that the bill is a "mistake", not because of the possible risks, or that the TGA is unfit to perform the evaluation, but because RU486 is "not just another drug", "facilitating a medical procedure that is not just a medical procedure".
SNT.32902.10748	Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle spoke in favour of the bill, making mention of views of others on the supposed push polling of some groups opposing the bill.
SNT.32902.10749	Liberal Senator Nick Minchin, the new Leader of the Government in the Senate, spoke in support of Humphries and his views, and "was not persuaded to support [the] bill", and expressed his "conservative" views that life begun "from conception onwards".
SNT.32902.10750	Family First Party Senator Steven Fielding spoke out against the bill also, likening the TGA as comprising of "unelected bureaucrats".
SNT.32902.10751	He further commented that Family First cannot consider the social policy issues without considering social views, and drew attention to the TGA's response in the earlier Senate inquiry that the TGA "cannot consider social and ethical issues".
SNT.32902.10752	Fielding drew attention to the guillotine being placed on the debate of the bill and the attitudes of the non-Government senators earlier criticising the Government on the industrial relations legislation being "rammed through" late last year.
SNT.85508.10753	Prior to 2007 Taipei 101 Run Up, organizers held a 35-floors warming up match for local athletes from 2009 Summer Deaflympics with the theme of "Value Your Every Step".
SNT.85508.10754	This warming up simulated every possible situation as athletes wore the RFID chip and some professional medical teams stood by for emergency.
SNT.85508.10755	Hsiao-hua Tseng and Lan-feng Chen, men's and women's fastest athlete in this (warming up) match, finished separately with 6 min 9 secs and 6 min 45 secs.
SNT.85508.10756	After this match, the host (Taipei 101) awarded certifications and announced that the main match will take place next Sunday (November 25) morning.
SNT.406019.10757	In the opening round of the 2012 ANZ Championship this past weekend, the Southern Steel beat the Bay of Plenty Magic in Invercargill, New Zealand by a score of 49–47, while over in Brisbane, Australia, the defending champion Queensland Firebirds lost to the Melbourne Vixens by a score of 47–42.
SNT.406019.10758	The wins by the Steel and the Vixens are considered by those who follow the netball league to be major upsets.
SNT.406019.10759	The Firebirds' loss this past Sunday was their first in fifteen games extending back to last season.
SNT.406019.10760	Last season's championship is not a harbinger of success this season, as every season since the league was founded in 2008, the defending champions have failed to finish in the top four and attempt to repeat their title claim.
SNT.406019.10761	Going into the game, the teams had played eight games against each other, splitting the record at 4 wins each.
SNT.406019.10762	The Vixens' win can be credited to several players including English national team player Geva Mentor, and returning Vixen stars Bianca Chatfield and Julie Corletto.
SNT.406019.10763	Firebird captain Laura Geitz's quality play could not overcome other difficulties on the court for her team.
SNT.406019.10764	In the Magic versus Steel game, the teams were tied at 44–44 with five minutes left in the game.
SNT.406019.10765	The local crowd were behind the Steel, and they finished the game ahead by two baskets.
SNT.406019.10766	The Magic's coach blames the loss partly on not preparing adequately to play against the Steel's Donna Wilkins, who gave birth to her third child in January of this year.
SNT.406019.10767	Jess Waitapu made her debut for the Magic because teammate Julianna Naoupu had health problems that impacted her ability to play.
SNT.406019.10768	On Sunday in Auckland, the favored LG Northern Mystics held on to defeat the Haier Central Pulse 51–47.
SNT.406019.10769	Silver Ferns member Maria Tutaia was replaced by coach Debbie Fuller in favor of Grace Rasmussen, with Rasmussen making six out of seven shots to help put the game away for her team.
SNT.406019.10770	The Mystics had six fewer shots than the visiting Pulse, but had a better shooting percentage which proved to be a decisive factor in the game.
SNT.406019.10771	In Perth on Monday, the West Coast Fever beat the Easiyo Canterbury Tactix by a score of 55–35.
SNT.406019.10772	The team's captain Maree Bowden and coach Leigh Gibbs were disappointed in the team's performance but believed there were some positives and room for improvement.
SNT.406019.10773	The West Coast Fever are the only Australian side in the competition to never have won the league's championship, with their best ever finish being seventh in the ten-team competition.
SNT.406019.10774	In September of last year, following the Australian victory at the Netball World Championships held in Singapore in July, the Fever signed Australian national team coach Norma Plummer as the club's new coach.
SNT.406019.10775	stuff.co.nzs Chris Barclay believes this means the Fever have a chance of winning, especially following a pre-season that included two wins, a tie to the Firebirds and a single loss.
SNT.406019.10776	She has sought to instill a greater sense of discipline in her players, not taking excuses for missing practices with the exception of Australian Diamond Susan Fuhrmann who is recovering from a chronic knee injury.
SNT.406019.10777	She also sought to improve the Fever's roster with the inclusion of England national netball team player Eboni Beckford-Chamber and former Swifts player Catherine Cox.
SNT.406019.10778	The Tactix are to play the Swifts at home this coming Monday in the second round.
SNT.406019.10779	In the third round, the Tactix will play the Steel, in a game stuff.co.nzs writer Matt Richens believes they can win.
SNT.406019.10780	In Adelaide this past Saturday, the Adelaide Thunderbirds beat the NSW Swifts by a score of 57–40.
SNT.406019.10781	Australian Diamond goal attack Sharelle McMahon has taken the season off from the Vixens as a result of pregnancy.
SNT.25962.10782	Former US president Bill Clinton was the guest of honor in a memorial ceremony attended by some 200,000 Israelis in Tel Aviv to mark the 10th anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
SNT.25962.10783	The rally was delayed one week due to Clinton's schedule.
SNT.25962.10784	Clinton opened his speech with some words of respect to the deputy prime minister Shimon Peres, "My dear friend Shimon Peres, thank you for servicing the case of peace all of your life and being a partner and a leader to all of us".
SNT.25962.10785	Regarding Rabin, Clinton said, "I loved him very much, and I was in awe of his ability to move from being a soldier to being a peacemaker, a politician to a statesman".
SNT.25962.10786	Clinton said that it was a great honor for him to be at the ceremony with his wife, daughter and friends from America to stand in solidarity for the memory of Yitzhak Rabin.
SNT.25962.10787	He said: "If he were here he would say, There is enough of all this missing."
SNT.25962.10788	"If you really think I lived a good life, if you think I made a noble sacrifice in death, then for goodness sakes, take up my work and see it through to the end" and concluded his speech with the words in Hebrew — "Shalom Haver" (Goodbye my friend).
SNT.25962.10789	Later Clinton joined Peres and the rest of the politicians, most of whom were from Rabin's Cabinet and were with him on the same stage in the original peace rally for singing "The Song For Peace", the same song that they sang with Rabin that night.
SNT.117064.10790	A study by the Ernst & Young Scottish ITEM Club has predicted that Scotland will enter the worst recession seen in the nation since 1980, but that the rest of the United Kingdom will fare worse.
SNT.117064.10791	Scottish GDP is expected to contract by 0.4% in 2009, compared to 1% for elsewhere in the UK.
SNT.117064.10792	The report expects this to account for 50,000 job losses in Scotland, with the worst level of unemployment since the 1990s - a jump from 74,000 to 124,000 out of work, or 4.4%.
SNT.117064.10793	Dougie Adams, author of the report, warns that if the financial crisis is worst than anticipated there could be a contraction of 1%, making 60,000 jobs lost.
SNT.117064.10794	Private services will fare worst, he says, with 20,000 jobs to go.
SNT.117064.10795	Next will be manufacturing, with 11,000 jobs lost, and 7,000 more will go in construction.
SNT.117064.10796	"The economy must face a future with a changed landscape for its previously buoyant banking sector," said Adams.
SNT.117064.10797	"These include policy actions at a global and UK level, including any fiscal measures announced in the pre-Budget report, and the fall in oil and commodity prices."
SNT.117064.10798	"The sharp decline in inflation that is in the pipeline will buoy disposable incomes and leaves an open door to further interest rate cuts."
SNT.117064.10799	"Finally, the UK will also benefit from the sharp fall in sterling that is unlikely to be frittered away by wage inflation."
SNT.117064.10800	"However, recovery critically depends on both the willingness of the banking system to extend credit and the readiness of businesses and consumers to use it."
SNT.117064.10801	In 2010, he predicts Scottish growth to recover by 1.5%, with the rest of the UK gaining only 1%.
SNT.413645.10802	Known for his struggle against French rule, Ben Bella led the nation from 1963 to 1965 having only learned during a prison sentence.
SNT.413645.10803	He came from a poor, agricultural background and left school early, but it was during his schooldays he joined Messali Hadj's Algerian People's Party.
SNT.413645.10804	Serving in World War II, Ben Bella was decorated with five medals for actions including conflict at the 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy and shooting down a German aircraft over Marseille, France. 
SNT.413645.10805	After the war he was elected to seniority within a group dedicated to ending French rule.
SNT.413645.10806	The movement was deemed illegal and Ben Bella escaped and fled two years after his 1951 arrest for his part in a fundraising robbery.
SNT.413645.10807	A bloody conflict for Algerian independence eventually convinced France to relinquish control in 1962 and Ben Bella was freed.
SNT.413645.10808	The following year he took control of a one-party nation.
SNT.413645.10809	Within years of attaining power, defence minister , an ally of current president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, overthrew Ben Bella in a coup.
SNT.413645.10810	Ben Bella had grappled with post-war consolidation after about 1.5 million French left the nation, leaving gaps in its economy.
SNT.413645.10811	"Today we lost one of modern Algeria's bravest leaders," said Bouteflika, declaring eight days of mourning.
SNT.413645.10812	Successive regimes detained Ben Bella first in prison and later his home from his deposition to 1980 when he left for Switzerland in exile, before being pardoned a decade later.
SNT.19856.10813	A cork was temporarily used to fix a fuel leak on a British passenger train.
SNT.19856.10814	The leak was created when the train struck a concrete block that vandals left on the tracks.
SNT.19856.10815	Train service on the Paddington to Exeter line was stopped around Bath.
SNT.19856.10816	This abrupt stop created a hole in the sightglass which helps monitor fuel levels.
SNT.19856.10817	Worried the incident could cause a fuel leak, staff decided to use the cork of a wine bottle found in the buffet car, to block the hole.
SNT.19856.10818	An incident that people worried would cause a delay of hours, was cleared up in around 20 minutes.
SNT.53680.10819	The newly appointed Ontario Provincial Police Commissioner Julian Fantino told reporters on Monday that "the Caledonia land dispute is the single biggest issue facing him" and that, " 'lawbreakers' in Caledonia will be dealt with swiftly, regardless of which side of the native occupation they are on."
SNT.53680.10820	The Caledonia land dispute has been going on since February 28 and still has not been resolved.
SNT.53680.10821	The native protesters occupied the Douglas Creek Estates, a housing development, southwest of Hamilton, saying that the property belongs to them.
SNT.53680.10822	Townspeople have repeatedly called for police to remove the protesters from the land, which is now owned by the province and being held in trust until the dispute is resolved.
SNT.53680.10823	"I certainly don't expect that there will be lawbreaking that isn't dealt with and that will be my message to our people as well, that it's their duty and responsibility is to enforce the laws," said OPP Commissioner Julian Fantino, on his first official day on the job.
SNT.53680.10824	"I assure that those who do break the law will be dealt with."
SNT.53680.10825	While under former commissioner Gwen Boniface, who resigned last year because of the dispute, the OPP were criticised for not enforcing the law, especially when several camera people were assaulted by native protesters.
SNT.53680.10826	Fantino said the on-going occupation of a property by members of the Six Nations Reserve is beyond his ability to resolve.
SNT.53680.10827	His role in the contentious dispute will be to keep the peace in the town of Caledonia.
SNT.53680.10828	Officials in Ontario and the federal governments are currently negotiating with Six Nations representatives.
SNT.252300.10829	Both the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) parties have announce "freebies" as part of their election manifestos in the lead-up to the vote in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
SNT.252300.10830	Freebies have been a success from the 2006 Tamil Nadu elections when DMK lured voters by announcing free colour televisions to households.
SNT.252300.10831	That triumph led the major opposition AIADMK to announce similar freebies in their manifesto published Thursday.
SNT.252300.10832	DMK has announced free laptops to college students, kitchen appliances and modern networks to rural regions.
SNT.252300.10833	The AIADMK, publishing their manifesto later, expanded on each of the promises of the DMK, plus offering 4g gold mangalsutra for the poor, monetary help for rural households and fishermen, free rice, and more.
SNT.252300.10834	AIADMK manifesto addresses larger issues, such as taking on the near-monopoly of the cable industry television industry, starting new Power generation plants to address power shortages in recent years.
SNT.6443.10835	Television star Jerry Springer has signed a contract to join the year-old political network Air America Radio Network starting April 1.
SNT.6443.10836	He says the new deal will not affect his popular television program, which will continue to be produced.
SNT.6443.10837	After initially being carried by only 45 stations nationwide, the host of the long-running syndicated program, The Jerry Springer Show will eventually have his radio show heard on all 51 Air America affiliates.
SNT.6443.10838	The show also is planned to be broadcast by the Sirius and XM satellite radio services.
SNT.6443.10839	Springer said he is committed to making his radio show a success.
SNT.6443.10840	"Progressive, populist voices need to be a part of our nation's dialogue," Springer said in a press release.
SNT.6443.10841	Although best-known for his low-budget, tongue-in-cheek talk show, Springer does have a political pedigree.
SNT.6443.10842	He was a Democrat mayor of Cincinnati in 1977 and made a failed bid for governor of Ohio in 1982.
SNT.21888.10843	Lexmark International introduced the Lexmark P450 in the USA yesterday, the first printer to have a built-in CD burner.
SNT.21888.10844	The CD burner allows users to copy photos from their camera directly to CD without requiring the printer to be connected to a computer.
SNT.21888.10845	The P450 is a small, portable printer that can print 4in by 6in photos.
SNT.21888.10846	Photos can be printed from USB flash drives, memory cards, Bluetooth devices and PictBridge compatible digital cameras.
SNT.21888.10847	The printer includes a 2.4-inch color LCD from which users can perform basic editing tasks such as cropping, rotating, and removing red-eye.
SNT.21888.10848	"The Lexmark P450 brings more photo processing functions to the home."
SNT.21888.10849	"People can now save and organize their digital photos on CD, print from a cell phone, view their photos on a television and much more."
SNT.21888.10850	"The Lexmark P450 is quite intuitive, easy to use and affordably priced," said Najib Bahous, president of Lexmark’s Consumer Printer Division.
SNT.21888.10851	This printer will compete with many other portable printers such as the popular and slightly cheaper HP Photosmart 375.
SNT.21888.10852	The Lexmark P450 is scheduled to be released in the USA in October, with an estimated retail price of $199USD, and Canada in November, with an estimated retail price of $299CAD.
SNT.21888.10853	It is scheduled to be released in other countries shortly thereafter.
SNT.204630.10854	Around 50 people have been arrested ahead of a planned human rights protest in Swaziland.
SNT.204630.10855	The protest had been planned against the monarchy of Swaziland to call attention to the country's alleged lack of human rights.
SNT.204630.10856	Many of those arrested have been released but several people remain in custody.
SNT.204630.10857	The King of Swaziland, Mswati III, has come under pressure for living in luxury with his thirteen wives while many Swazi people are on the poverty line.
SNT.204630.10858	He has also faced criticism for having a high number of sexual partners, when 26% of 15 to 49 year olds are HIV positive.
SNT.204630.10859	Several South African trade unionists were included in the protesters arrested.
SNT.204630.10860	A spokesman for Cosatu, the South African trade union federation, said that two of the unionists had not been released and their current whereabouts are unknown.
SNT.204630.10861	Human rights group Amnesty International has commented on the events saying that, "The arbitrary arrest of these political activists, lawyers, trade unionists and journalists is nothing short of police harassment and intimidation."
SNT.204630.10862	Swaziland is the last country in Africa to hold an absolute monarchy.
SNT.110678.10863	The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) approved two new IEEE 1394 Firewire standards last week.
SNT.110678.10864	S1600 and S3200 — which enable data transmission rates up to 1.6 Gbps and 3.2 Gbps respectively — would make Firewire (Apple's name for the standard) theoretically four times faster than is currently possible.
SNT.110678.10865	According to IEEE, the new standards are based on IEEE 1394b (FireWire 800) Standard.
SNT.110678.10866	The new standard will allow peer-to-peer transfer without linking computers.
SNT.110678.10867	In addition, the S1600 and S3200 standards will continue supporting the S400 and S800 previous standards through backward compatibility.
SNT.110678.10868	"The new standard includes all of the amendments, enhancements and more than 100 errata which have been added to the base standard over the last 12 years," Les Baxter, chair of the working group which developed the standard, said in a press release cited in several sources.
SNT.110678.10869	"This update provides developers with a single document they can rely upon for all of their application needs."
SNT.110678.10870	Though not as common as the USB standard, Firewire serves a niche market, especially the aviation industry.
SNT.110678.10871	USB 3.0, the next generation of the competing USB standard, is due in 2010 with reported speeds of 4.8 Gbps.
SNT.8961.10872	The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) says it finished interrogating the nearly 105 Iraqi scientists it held in its search for weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
SNT.8961.10873	In many cases their information was helpful, but in other cases the wrong people were detained, and were subjected to questioning by "inexperienced and uninformed" interrogators.
SNT.8961.10874	From an update to the Comprehensive Report of the Special Adviser to the DCI on Iraq's WMD, "As matters now stand, the WMD investigation has gone as far as feasible."
SNT.8961.10875	After more than 18 months, the WMD investigation and debriefing of the WMD-related detainees has been exhausted.
SNT.8961.10876	"As far as the WMD investigation is concerned, there is no further purpose in holding many of these detainees."
SNT.8961.10877	"These individuals have shown no reluctance to engage in further discussions should the need for questioning arise about past WMD programs."
SNT.8961.10878	Elsewhere, "Some may have other issues to account for, including Regime finance questions, but certainly some have been quite helpful toward the compilation of an accurate picture of the Regime's WMD efforts and intentions over the last three decades."
SNT.8961.10879	The comments were addenda and an accompanying note, supplemental to the original report, which was issued last autumn, and seen as the final report of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG).
SNT.8961.10880	They were added by Charles Duelfer, head of the ISG, and Special Adviser to the Director of Central Intelligence in Baghdad.
SNT.8961.10881	Deulfer emphasised that more information is likely to emerge naturally, over time, from people with differing viewpoints and interests.
SNT.8961.10882	And a backlog of documents recovered from the former regime remain to be examined.
SNT.8961.10883	A preference for reinforcement of short-term security on the part of the coalition forces over anti-proliferation efforts, fear of arrest and detention on the part of the Iraqi personnel, and other factors in the continuing conflict of the post-war environment, all impacted on the effort by the ISG.
SNT.8961.10884	The report confirms the expressed opinion of former UN weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, that Iraq had no significant WMDs.
SNT.8961.10885	"[T]here was not a single intelligence service in the world that said Iraq maintained massive stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction," Ritter said at the time.
SNT.8961.10886	Duelfer summary of the intelligence obtained, as understood by the ISG, includes, "[T]he risk of Iraqi WMD expertise of material advancing the WMD potential in other countries is attenuated by many factors and is presently small ..."
SNT.8961.10887	And, "So far, insurgent efforts to attain unconventional weapons have been limited and contained by coalition actions."
SNT.8961.10888	Also, "There continue to be reports of WMD in Iraq."
SNT.8961.10889	"ISG has found that such reports are usually scams or in misidentification of materials or activities."
SNT.8961.10890	"In a very limited number of cases they have related to old chemical munitions produced before 1990."
SNT.8961.10891	The new addenda included information on the Iraqi Military Industrial Commission, the "state-run military-industrial complex" which played a "central role in the evolution of all the Regime's weapons programs".
SNT.260917.10892	U.S. security officials have cleared a Delta Airlines passenger jet diverted to New Mexico to take off again because "no suspicious items" had been found.
SNT.260917.10893	The aircraft was reportedly initially diverted after the crew found a note with the word "bomb" written on it in the lavatory, but security officials have declined to comment on the nature of the "potential security threat".
SNT.260917.10894	Delta Airlines 1706—a domestic U.S. flight between Detroit and San Diego—diverted to Albuquerque International Sunport in Albuquerque, where the Boeing 737-800 aircraft was taken to a remote area of the airport.
SNT.260917.10895	Passengers were interviewed by FBI agents, and dogs searched all the luggage on board.
SNT.260917.10896	No one has yet been arrested, but the note has been determined to be hoax.
SNT.260917.10897	One passenger said the captain spoke over the intercom, saying: "We're getting ready to divert."
SNT.260917.10898	"It's probably a hoax, but we've got to take this very seriously."
SNT.260917.10899	After being cleared of any threat, the aircraft was expected to continue to San Diego.
SNT.113044.10900	Lehman Brothers, a major American investment banker, has filed paperwork for bankruptcy.
SNT.113044.10901	It would be the largest collapse of an investment firm in 18 years.
SNT.113044.10902	Lehman attempted to find a buyer over the weekend but it met with no success.
SNT.113044.10903	The last remaining bidder, Barclays PLC bank pulled out Sunday afternoon.
SNT.113044.10904	Barclays, a United Kingdom-based bank, had become the sole bidder after a consortium led by Bank of America pulled out early Sunday morning citing that it would need government support before considering a bid.
SNT.113044.10905	The support would consist of backing bad debts owed by Lehman.
SNT.113044.10906	As of Monday morning, no buyer has come through to take control of the firm.
SNT.113044.10907	The main sticking point for potential buyers appears to be the unwillingness for the U.S. government to provide financial support.
SNT.113044.10908	Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, has repeatedly said that no government money will be given to Lehman or used in any takeover the firm.
SNT.113044.10909	Government money was used in the takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase in March of this year.
SNT.113044.10910	A spokesmen for Barclays told the Financial Times, "the proposed transaction required a guarantee for the trading operations of Lehman Brothers that was potentially open-ended, and we were not willing to provide that guarantee."
SNT.113044.10911	Paulson, along with other government officials, proposed a solution that Lehman would get split into two separate entities.
SNT.113044.10912	However, this proposal has been discarded by many of Wall Street banks.
SNT.113044.10913	Members of the G8 have reportedly been keep abreast of the situation by U.S. government.
SNT.113044.10914	The firm, which has over 25,000 staffers, has suffered bad results due to the subprime mortgage crisis.
SNT.108066.10915	Almost all the prisoners kept in Kandahar jail have escaped after the building was attacked by Taliban militants.
SNT.108066.10916	Police have reported that "a suicide attacker drove his way into the main gate of the prison, it was very strong and destroyed the gate and two sides of the surrounding wall."
SNT.108066.10917	About 350 militants participated in the attack, and 15 guards were killed, while about 1,000 prisoners escaped.
SNT.108066.10918	The Taliban used a combination of two suicide bombers and roughly 30 other militants on motorcycles with rockets and small-arms to attack the prison.
SNT.108066.10919	The suicide bombers destroyed the main gate to the prison, as well as a wall.
SNT.108066.10920	Afterwards, the other militants engaged in a massive gun attack on the prison guards, allowing prisoners to escape.
SNT.108066.10921	A state of emergency has been declared throughout Kandahar province, as large numbers of both Afghan and NATO forces have been deployed to track down the escaped prisoners.
SNT.144157.10922	The European Environment Agency (EEA) released a report which shows that the European Union is on track to meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments to limit and reduce emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect on our earth.
SNT.144157.10923	The five member states France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom have already reached the target.
SNT.144157.10924	All other member states, except Austria, which has to strengthen its efforts, expect to reach the target, too.
SNT.144157.10925	EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade said: "It is encouraging that Europe's climate-changing emissions are expected to continue decreasing, outperforming the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol."
SNT.144157.10926	"Such an accomplishment should encourage all countries to agree on much larger reductions of global emissions, sealing a global deal in Copenhagen this December."
SNT.144157.10927	"Commitments to deep emission cuts are urgently needed to preserve our chances to keep planetary temperature increases below 2ºC."
SNT.187988.10928	Aníbal Archila, a Guatemalan reporter for Notisiete, was killed Thursday night as he was reporting on the eruption of the Pacaya volcano.
SNT.187988.10929	Firefighters and another journalist found his body near Cerro Chino.

SNT.187988.10936	Internment will take place at the Hermano Pedro cemetery in Mixco.
SNT.187988.10937	The volcano began erupting on Thursday, and on Friday searches began for another three people who are missing.
SNT.187988.10938	Colom has placed Guatemala City and the Escuintla region under a state of emergency.
SNT.187988.10939	About 1,600 people have been evacuated from the region, and La Aurora International Airport has been closed.
SNT.30633.10940	The Turkish government has come under fire from officials in Dogubayazit, where three siblings died from the H5N1 strain of Bird Flu, for not sending enough resources and not responding quickly enough in the region.
SNT.30633.10941	The mayor of Dogubayazit, Mukkades Kubilay, claims that the Turkish government sent only three doctors and that there were not enough workers to destroy poultry.
SNT.30633.10942	The government has been accused of doing too little, too late.
SNT.30633.10943	Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker dismissed the claim, saying that culling of infected poultry began immediately following the discovery of H5N1 on December 15, 2005.
SNT.30633.10944	Questions about whether the government acted aggressively enough early in the outbreak emerged as officials tried to contain the disease, which Eker said had been confirmed in 11 of Turkey's 81 provinces and was suspected in 14 others.
SNT.30633.10945	The number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 in Turkey is 18.
SNT.30633.10946	Several others with the virus have shown few symptoms or are in a stable condition.
SNT.30633.10947	Authorities suggest that the strain may not be as deadly as first thought.
SNT.30633.10948	Of those who contracted the virus in Asia, half died.
SNT.30633.10949	An eight-year-old child who became infected after playing with dying chickens has been released from hospital.
SNT.30633.10950	Nationwide, 355,000 birds have been slaughtered in an attempt to slow the outbreak.
SNT.30633.10951	The Agricultural ministry is complaining that it has only 24 workers in Dogubayazit, a city of 56,000, and culling could take up to a month to complete.
SNT.30633.10952	Experts are still warning of a possible pandemic, prompting the world bank to release US$500 million in aid to assist countries combat H5N1.
SNT.145744.10953	Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani announced that the military operation targeting Taliban militants based in the South Waziristan tribal region is now over, after nearly two months.
SNT.145744.10954	He commented that the military is now focusing on the nearby Orakzai tribal region, in order to pursue the Pakistani Taliban leadership that is believed to have fled there from South Waziristan.
SNT.145744.10955	There recently have been heavy artillery and air strikes in the area.
SNT.145744.10956	"Now there are talks about Orakzai," Gilani said earlier today to reporters in a televised speech
SNT.145744.10957	In mid-October, Gilani ordered Pakistan's military to conduct the offensive, known as Operation Rah-e-Nijat or "Road to Deliverance."
SNT.145744.10958	Military officials say more than 600 Taliban members and some 80 soldiers have been killed in the operation near the Afghan border.
SNT.145744.10959	These numbers have not been independently verified because, except for a few military-organized trips, the military has largely closed the area to journalists and aid agencies.
SNT.145744.10960	The United Nations reported that about 40,000 of people have fled the region, and need humanitarian aid.
SNT.145744.10961	Pakistani officials have blamed Mehsud's organization for a series of high profile attacks across the country that has killed more than 500 people since the beginning of October.
SNT.36526.10962	Thousands of people around the world took to the streets in a "Global Day of Action" to mark the third anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq.
SNT.36526.10963	The weekend rallies and demonstrations drew smaller crowds than earlier anti-war demonstrations, when millions gathered in 2003 and 2004.
SNT.36526.10964	US President George W. Bush, with dwindling public support for the war, marked the occasion with a speech, outlining his commitment to democracy in the region.
SNT.143146.10965	Three days after a US Navy helicopter collided with a US Coast Guard airplane off the coast of California, a search and rescue mission is ongoing for the nine crew onboard the two aircraft.
SNT.143146.10966	The two on board the AH-1W SuperCobra attack helicopter and seven on the C-130 Hercules transport plane were trained in survival and described as being in good physical condition, meaning rescuers maintain hope of finding them alive.
SNT.143146.10967	They all had heat-retaining drysuits but it was unknown if they were wearing them at the time.
SNT.143146.10968	The accident occurred at 7:10 p.m. on Thursday in an area of military airspace that is sometimes closed to the public, although its status at the time of the accident was not known.
SNT.143146.10969	The helicopter had been in formation with two transports and another SuperCobra to practise night flying, while the Coast Guard plane was conducting search and rescue for 50-year-old boater David Jines.
SNT.143146.10970	The search for Jines ends today whether he is found or not.
SNT.143146.10971	After searching 644 square miles of ocean with nine aircraft debris has been located from both the aircraft, but no trace has been found of those on board.
SNT.143146.10972	Operations are currently focusing near the military's San Clemente Island, where an area of about 50 miles of floating wreckage is located.
SNT.149596.10973	British murderer Gordon Park was found dead today in his cell at a prison in Lancashire, England.
SNT.149596.10974	Park, whose 66th birthday was today, was convicted nearly five years ago of the murder of his wife, Carol, in 1976.
SNT.149596.10975	Her body was found over twenty years later in Coniston Water, in the Lake District, Northern England, leading to her being dubbed the "Lady in the Lake" by police, after the Raymond Chandler novel.
SNT.149596.10976	The Prison Service state Park was found hanging in his cell at Garth Prison, unconscious, at 8am local time.
SNT.149596.10977	"Staff and paramedics attended but Mr Park was pronounced dead at 9.40am", a spokesman added.
SNT.149596.10978	An investigation has been launched by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, responsible for investigating deaths in custody; but suicide is suspected.
SNT.149596.10979	His son, Jeremy, who had been fighting for his father's release, said "[w]e are all completely devastated and still believe his innocence 100%."
SNT.149596.10980	Park was jailed for life in January 2005, with a minimum period of fifteen years, for his wife's murder after a ten-week trial at Manchester Crown Court.
SNT.149596.10981	Carol Park was killed with an ice axe, then her body concealed in Coniston Water.
SNT.149596.10982	She was not found until August 1997, when divers found her weighted corpse 70 feet deep.
SNT.149596.10983	Park had claimed that his wife had left him for another man.
SNT.149596.10984	His appeal against conviction was turned down in 2008, with the Court of Appeal saying that the geological evidence he wished to challenge was only one factor of the "strong circumstantial case" proving his guilt.
SNT.10309.10985	Six of the world's largest computer companies are seeking to have a patent held by the Australian Government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) revoked.
SNT.10309.10986	Microsoft, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Apple and Netgear are taking legal action against the CSIRO to have its U.S. patent broken.
SNT.10309.10987	In 1996, the CSIRO developed technology to allow computers to be networked together wirelessly.
SNT.10309.10988	The technology is now built in to most laptop computers and manufacturers currently pay the CSIRO a licence fee to use it.
SNT.10309.10989	According to CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Geoff Garrett, the system enables the speed of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) to be increased by a factor of five.
SNT.10309.10990	This isn't the first time that the CSIRO has been involved in legal action surrounding this patent: in February 2005, it commenced legal action in the United States against Buffalo Technology, a Japanese-owned company, which had ended negotiations with CSIRO about obtaining a licence.
SNT.10309.10991	The Australian Government's research arm has announced that it will fight the legal action to protect its intellectual property, the income of which it uses to fund its research.
SNT.10309.10992	It has come under increasing pressure following the Australian Government's cutting its funding in 2003, which has only been recently restored.
SNT.10309.10993	"As part of our business we create high quality intellectual property and we are prepared to defend it," Garrett said.
SNT.10309.10994	"We actively encourage the utilisation of the results of research in industry and communities, both nationally and globally, and any royalty income will be reinvested in further research."
SNT.10309.10995	The patent in question is U.S. Patent 5,487,069 Wireless LAN.
SNT.10309.10996	The case also raises issues about the recent signing of a Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States.
SNT.10309.10997	Per the agreement, Australia plans to introduce American-style intellectual property law.
SNT.3700.10998	WASHINGTON (AP) The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly confirmed Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state after a host of Democrats harshly criticized Bush administration Iraq policy.
SNT.3700.10999	The expectation of Rice becoming the Secretary of State, like many presumed, has come true.
SNT.394879.11000	The United States is replacing emergency oxygen handles on its 170 jet fighters.
SNT.394879.11001	The move follows a report into a November 2010 crash that killed a pilot in Alaska.
SNT.394879.11002	The report finds Captain Jeffrey Haney's death was partly due to aircraft design flaws.
SNT.394879.11003	The experienced 31-year-old was on a night mission when his aircraft crashed nose-down among mountains.
SNT.394879.11004	Planemaker now faces legal action from his widow Anna, which they vow to contest.
SNT.394879.11005	The report identified three separate problems with the ring handle to activate emergency oxygen.
SNT.394879.11006	The first was that pulling the ring could require intense effort, the second that it was possible to drop the ring between seats, and the third that pilots in cold-weather gear could struggle to grasp it.
SNT.394879.11007	Now new handles have been designed in Arizona and the Air Force will place them on all of the 143 million aircraft.
SNT.394879.11008	All 40 Raptors at Haney's base, near , have received the $47 upgrade.
SNT.394879.11009	Haney's death has been attributed by his employer as the result of his "channelized attention" on getting the main oxygen system to restart after it automatically cut out when it detected engine bay air leaks.
SNT.394879.11010	The Air Force say he should have activated his emergency oxygen but the accident report and lawsuit question his ability to do so.
SNT.394879.11011	The report notes he was conscious and fighting to keep his jet airbourne up until impact.
SNT.394879.11012	Documents filed with a court in Illinois claim the handle's position is "in an area impossible for a pilot to reach while he or she maneuvered the sophisticated aircraft at speeds exceeding the speed of sound and while he or she experienced forces many times the force of gravity."
SNT.394879.11013	The fatal accident is not the only such problem to beset the F-22, which despite being billed by the Air Force as their most advanced fighter has never been deployed to combat since coming into service seven years ago.
SNT.394879.11014	Three other Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson pilots activated emergency oxygen supplies during "physiological incidents" last month, said a spokesperson for the base.
SNT.394879.11015	Raptors were grounded nationwide for five months last Summer over the oxygen systems.
SNT.33704.11016	The Australian based pharmaceutical company CSL has announced that despite promising human trials of their bird flu vaccine, more research is needed before the final formula can be developed.
SNT.33704.11017	Late last year the Australian federal government gave CSL AU$ 5 million to speed up research into the bird flu vaccine.
SNT.33704.11018	The vaccine was tested on 400 Australians aged between 18 and 45 in October last year to determine its safety and effectiveness.
SNT.33704.11019	The strain of bird flu used for the trials was taken from a bird flu victim in Vietnam and neutralised to prevent it from being contagious.
SNT.33704.11020	The next phase of the trial will include 700 people from varying age groups.
SNT.33704.11021	CSL has previously indicated that once their vaccine is approved, it could take between three and six months to manufacture enough of the vaccine to inoculate every Australian.
SNT.185194.11022	The Pakistani government has blocked access to YouTube, the popular video-sharing website, citing "growing sacrilegious" content.
SNT.185194.11023	The move comes after a Pakistani court ordered a temporary block of social networking site Facebook on Wednesday, when a row unfolded concerning a group on Facebook urging users on the popular social networking site to draw pictures of the Prophet Mohammed.
SNT.185194.11024	The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, the government agency responsible for the operation and maintenance of Pakistani telecommunications, ordered all internet service providers to "completely shut-down" all access to Facebook and YouTube from the interior of Pakistan.
SNT.185194.11025	According to a spokesman, the agency only did so after "all possible" options had been exhausted.
SNT.185194.11026	The spokesman, Khoram Ali Mehran, said that they were "just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court", and that "if the government decides to unblock it, then that's what we will do".
SNT.185194.11027	The Facebook user who created the group, entitled "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", said that she had got the idea for the group after watching an episode of South Park on the television channel Comedy Central, in which a line involving the Prophet had been 'bleeped out'.
SNT.185194.11028	The site was blocked the day before the event was scheduled to take place.
SNT.185194.11029	YouTube was blocked in Pakistan in 2008, when material deemed "offensive to Muslims" led to restrictions.
SNT.185194.11030	Access to Wikipedia, Wikinews' sister project, and Flickr, a photo sharing site, were also banned, on Thursday.
SNT.5199.11031	A gene has been discovered that turns stem cells into cancer killers, promising new treatments that boost the body's ability to destroy tumors.
SNT.5199.11032	South Korean scientists from the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology in Daejeon say that the gene, Vitamin D3 Upregulated Protein 1 (VDUP1), spurs stem cells to become natural killer cells.
SNT.5199.11033	These components of the immune system can eliminate virus-infected and cancerous cells.
SNT.5199.11034	Research leader Inpyo Choi says the team observed that VDUP1 plays a decisive role in causing stem cells to become natural killers.
SNT.5199.11035	The discovery was made by examining mice bred to lack the gene.
SNT.5199.11036	The mice had a dramatic reduction in the number and activity of natural killer cells.
SNT.5199.11037	Besides determining the gene's importance to the immune system, Choi and colleagues have developed technology needed to spur the creation of natural killers from a person's own bone marrow stem cells.
SNT.5199.11038	Choi calls this "the first step toward developing new treatments using our own immune system to fight cancers and other serious diseases."
SNT.253332.11039	Ed Miliband — the current leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition in the United Kingdom — and Justine Thornton, his long-term partner, have announced that they are now engaged to each other.
SNT.253332.11040	They are anticipated to marry in Nottingham, England on May 27.
SNT.253332.11041	The couple, who have been in a relationship for five years, currently have two children — Daniel, aged twenty-one months, and Samuel, who was born in November 2010.
SNT.253332.11042	Until now, they had been "too busy" to perform the act of marriage, due to various occurrences; according to The Daily Telegraph, this includes Ed's work in the 2010 UK general election, the birth of their son Daniel, and Ed's appearance at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference.
SNT.253332.11043	41-year-old Miliband proposed to 40-year-old Thornton at Primrose Hill, a short distance from their residence in the northern area of London, in 2010.
SNT.253332.11044	Marion Miliband, the mother of Ed, was the first individual to be notified of this news.
SNT.253332.11045	David Miliband, his brother and a fellow UK politician, was "the person I told after my mother", Ed stated; he "is delighted for me and he will obviously be there".
SNT.253332.11046	According to Miliband, of all the guests at the wedding, "family and close friends" will be amongst the approximately fifty individuals receiving invitations to "something that has been on our minds for some time", describing the upcoming day as "fun".
SNT.253332.11047	He has stated there will be no best man present at the ceremony, contrary to speculation that the role would be given to David.
SNT.253332.11048	After the wedding, Ed and Justine are intending to have a honeymoon in a secret location.
SNT.253332.11049	Miliband was asked if he thought it was important to be married in case he becomes the next prime minister.
SNT.253332.11050	He replied: "I think people are pretty relaxed about this."
SNT.253332.11051	"I don't think people care one way or the other about what other people do in their lives as long as they show responsibility to each other."
SNT.64552.11052	U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates warned that limiting funding for the United States efforts in Iraq could lead to more bloodshed in the Middle Eastern country.
SNT.64552.11053	In an interview with radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, he said it might even lead to ethnic cleansing in Bahgdad and elsewhere in Iraq.
SNT.64552.11054	Gates' comment followed a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to end most spending on the Iraq war in 2008, limiting it to targeted operations against al Qaeda, training for Iraqi troops and U.S. force protection.
SNT.64552.11055	Sec. Gates also said that the duration of the troop increase is not clear and that evaluating whether the Administration's new strategy was working will have to wait till mid-summer.
SNT.64552.11056	The Army general charged with day-to-day operations has suggested that the increased deployment may extend to early next year.
SNT.79767.11057	Sri Lanka have beaten Kenya by 172 runs in Group C of the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship at Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa.
SNT.79767.11058	Sanath Jayasuriya scored 88 runs off 44 balls as Sri Lanka raced to 260-6 off 20 overs, the highest total made in a Twenty20 international.
SNT.79767.11059	Mahela Jayawardene scored 65 runs before falling lbw to Jimmy Kamande, who took 3-48, bowling Kumar Sangakkara for 30 and Tillakaratne Dilshan for just three runs.

SNT.79767.11061	Chaminda Vaas immediately made a breakthrough, dismissing opening batsman Maurice Ouma for a duck.
SNT.79767.11062	Kenya never recovered, and were reduced to just 88 runs in the 20th over as Sri Lanka dismissed their batsmen cheaply.
SNT.79767.11063	The win, by 172 runs, is the largest margin of victory in a Twenty20 international.
SNT.1117.11064	Seven unknown men armed with guns invaded the Terra Prometida camp, in Felisburgo city, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and killed five members of the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement movement (MST).
SNT.1117.11065	The Terra Prometida camp had been invaded by the MST in May 2002 and there were about 200 MST families living there at the time of the attack.
SNT.1117.11066	According to MST camp leaders the gunfighters set fire to MST tents and started shooting.
SNT.1117.11067	The Workers Party (PT) has demanded the gunfighters' arrest and punishment.
SNT.1117.11068	The MST is an ideologically diverse movement of agricultural workers in Brazil officially founded in 1984.
SNT.1117.11069	According to MST, in 2003 there were about 632 MST camps in Brazil.
SNT.1117.11070	MST is a large organization with many bases throughout Brazilian cities.
SNT.1117.11071	Their most visible tactic has been the occupation of mostly privately-held plantations and landholdings, sometimes armed with carving knifes and scythes.
SNT.1117.11072	Currently, MST receives help from the Brazilian government and donations from international organizations.
SNT.1117.11073	The movement also receives funds by selling videos of their invasions.
SNT.1117.11074	Overall, a recent report on labor standards in Brazil has shown that conditions for laborers are poor.
SNT.208402.11075	A documentary set to be shown on October 10, 2010 in Australia about the life and times of the soon to be canonised Mary MacKillop — who will be the first Australian to be made a saint — suggests that nuns including MacKillop of the Sisterhood of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart in South Australia were condemned and even excommunicated by high-ranking priests for informing the authorities of the apparent paedophilic acts of Father Patrick Keating at a local public school in Kapunda, South Australia.
SNT.208402.11076	The excommunication of MacKillop and other nuns was performed by the Bishop of Adelaide, Laurence Bonaventure Sheil, in 1871, but the documentary is set to suggest that the influence of Father Charles Horan was the driving force behind the act.
SNT.208402.11077	"She submitted to a farcical ceremony where the bishop was, I'm not sure you should use this word, gaga, but he had lost it and he was being manipulated by malicious priests," Father Paul Gardiner, a prominent figure in the canonisation of Mary McKillop, claims.
SNT.208402.11078	According to Ignatius Fennessy in the Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society:"One Thursday evening, 21 September 1871, Horan told Mary MacKillop that the bishop (who had called while she was out that day) wanted her to go to another convent."
SNT.208402.11080	"She could not go that night and wanted to discuss matters with the sisters and the bishop as well."
SNT.208402.11081	"Horan told her that the bishop would not see her and added, 'I suppose you won't go.'"
SNT.208402.11082	"The next morning the bishop arrived with four priests and, in a ranting mood, amid the hysteria of some of the sisters, and with MacKillop kneeling down on her knees in the chapel, he excommunicated her and sent her back into the world."
SNT.208402.11083	Bishop Shiel renounced the excommunications on his deathbed five months later.
SNT.208402.11084	The alleged paedophile priest, Father Keating, returned to Ireland, where he continued in fatherhood in the Catholic Church.
SNT.208402.11085	Mary MacKillop officially becomes the first sainted Australian on October 17, 2010 in a ceremony at The Vatican.
SNT.52445.11086	The recent E. coli outbreak that killed three people and sickened nearly 200 in the United States and Canada has been linked to cattle.
SNT.52445.11087	Shortly after the outbreak began, the contaminated spinach had been traced to the Salinas Valley region of California.
SNT.52445.11088	Now, health officials say the contamination came from cattle manure.
SNT.52445.11089	The infected cattle manure was found on a ranch in Salinas Valley that is adjacent to the field that produced contaminated spinach.
SNT.52445.11090	How precisely the infection was transported from the ranch to the spinach field is still unknown.
SNT.52445.11091	Dr. Kevin Reilly of the California Department of Health Services said that "we don't know if wild swine are playing a role or not, but we do know that on this particular ranch, there is a very large population of wild boar, and we have witnessed on this site that they have torn through fencing and under fencing and have the ability to access the field".
SNT.52445.11092	The bacteria could have been carried by wild animals from the cattle ranch to the spinach field.
SNT.52445.11093	Joan Rose, a microbiologist and food safety expert at Michigan State University, commented that it is not surprising that cattle manure was the source of the infection.
SNT.52445.11094	"If you start to look at the pathogen levels even in untreated sewage, it's minor compared to animal waste", she said.
SNT.195091.11095	Spain defeated the Netherlands in extra time 1–0 to win this year's FIFA World Cup.
SNT.195091.11096	The winning goal came in the last few minutes of the match, which saw thirteen yellow cards and one red card.
SNT.195091.11097	Yesterday's win marked Spain's first World Cup victory, in their first World Cup final appearance, making the Spanish team the eighth distinct team to have won the championship since it began in 1930.
SNT.195091.11098	It was the second time that the European champion for that year won the World Cup as well, the first being West Germany's victory in 1974.
SNT.195091.11099	It was also the first time that a European team emerged as the World Cup victors on a continent other than Europe.
SNT.195091.11100	For the Dutch, it was the third time they have lost in the World Cup finals, having done so in 1974 and 1978.
SNT.195091.11101	The final match, played in Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium, stayed tied at 0–0 for all of regulation time.
SNT.195091.11102	Called "a very difficult match" by Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque, the game started with a slow first half.
SNT.195091.11103	The Dutch had an opportunity to take the lead in the second half, but Arjen Robben's shots were blocked by Spanish captain Iker Casillas.
SNT.195091.11104	The Netherlands were forced to play with only ten players near the end of extra time after John Heitinga was kicked out of the game.
SNT.195091.11105	The winning shot of the match came from Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta in the 116th minute, just four minutes from the end of extra time.
SNT.195091.11106	He managed to kick the ball past Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from just 8 metres (26.2 feet) away.
SNT.195091.11107	If Iniesta had not made the goal, and game stayed scoreless until the end of extra time, the game would have been decided by a penalty shoot-out.
SNT.195091.11108	Spain's victory was correctly predicted by the oracular animal Paul the Octopus.
SNT.195091.11109	Paul's 2010 FIFA World Cup prediction record stayed at 100 per cent as a result.
SNT.264852.11110	Fifteen years after the Winnipeg Jets left the province of Manitoba, Canada, an announcement on Tuesday made official what ice hockey fans have been anticipating: The National Hockey League's (NHL) Atlanta Thrashers are moving to Winnipeg.
SNT.264852.11111	The Thrashers, who have been a target for relocation rumors amid the ownership struggles and financial losses, will leave Atlanta after eleven seasons there in the highest-level professional ice hockey league in North America.
SNT.264852.11112	The deal, which was finalized early in the morning Tuesday, has just one step to climb: a vote by the NHL's Board of Governors, which will take up the matter at their June 21 meeting.
SNT.264852.11113	Atlanta Spirit Group, LLC. (ASG), who owned the Thrashers—and continues to own both the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association, as well as Philips Arena, the arena both teams occupied—completed the sale to Winnipeg investor group True North Sports & Entertainment Ltd.
SNT.264852.11114	The Thrashers will move into their new home arena, MTS Centre in Winnipeg.
SNT.264852.11115	ASG has also been trying to find buyers for the Atlanta Hawks as well as Philips Arena.
SNT.264852.11116	NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who also presided over the league when the Jets left Winnipeg in 1996, has stated the Thrashers will remain in the Southeast Division for at least the 2011-12 season, after which time the NHL is expected to shuffle teams between the Western and Eastern conferences to move the Thrashers to the West, to play with other teams in western North America.
SNT.264852.11117	The two teams situated in the Western Conference which reside in the Eastern Time Zone, the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets, as well as the Nashville Predators are considered favorites to be moved into the Eastern Conference when this happens.
SNT.264852.11118	The city of Winnipeg, which has been ready and waiting for an NHL franchise since the Jets relocated to Glendale, Arizona and became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996, is already host to a team in the second-tier American Hockey League, the Manitoba Moose.
SNT.264852.11119	During the announcement Tuesday, True North stated that they were starting a season ticket drive.
SNT.264852.11120	They also announced that they have yet to choose a name for the new team.
SNT.264852.11121	The Thrashers are not the first franchise that True North has set its sights on in regards to acquiring an NHL team.
SNT.264852.11122	The Coyotes, which have been owned by the league since the previous owners filed for bankruptcy in 2009, was highly sought-after by True North in the past few years in an attempt to literally "return the Jets to Winnipeg".
SNT.264852.11123	In early May, the Glendale City Council approved a measure to pay $25 million to the league, to cover their operating expenses for the next year in order to keep the team in the city.
SNT.264852.11124	This is not the first time an NHL franchise has been relocated north of the border from the #8-ranked media market in the United States; in 1980, the Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary, Alberta, becoming the Calgary Flames.
SNT.264852.11125	Atlanta was later granted an expansion franchise in 1997, and the Thrashers took the ice to start the 1999-00 NHL season.
SNT.264852.11126	In the 11 seasons the Thrashers spent in Atlanta, they made the playoffs only once; in the 2006-07 season, they reached the Eastern Conference quarterfinals, where they were swept in the best-of-seven series by the New York Rangers in four straight games.
SNT.57631.11127	Sunnis upset over the hanging of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein began protesting Monday, the Associated Press reported.
SNT.57631.11128	A mob in Samara, a town in the Sunni-dominated region of Iraq, tore off pieces of a bombed-out Shiite shrine, called the Golden Dome, which was attacked by extremists 10 months ago.
SNT.57631.11129	They also carried a mock coffin and photos of Hussein, a Sunni who was executed by the majority-Shiite government on Saturday.
SNT.57631.11130	Many were angered by a three-minute video, apparently shot on a cellphone and making its way around the Internet, that showed Hussein taunted by his Shiite executioners moments before he dropped to his death.
SNT.57631.11131	In the video, those gathered to witness Hussein's execution could be heard chanting, "Muqtada! Muqtada! Muqtada!" for Muqtada Sadr, whose radical Shiite militia has been known to hunt down Sunni Arabs and kill them.
SNT.57631.11132	At least one photo taken by the Associated Press showed a protestor Monday with a hand covered in red, made to look like blood.
SNT.57631.11133	The protest followed Hussein's burial the day before in his birthplace of Al Auja, where mourners also expressed outrage for the hanging.
SNT.57631.11134	"Today they proved themselves that the trial and the execution were mere retaliation and not justice," one mourner told the Los Angeles Times.
SNT.8079.11135	According to Dr. Vinton Cerf, a few movie producers have talked about using filesharing such as BitTorrent for the distribution of video content.
SNT.8079.11136	Dr. Cerf is considered to be one of the fathers of the Internet.
SNT.8079.11137	One of the problems with having a video on demand service is video files take quite a bit of bandwidth to distribute.
SNT.8079.11138	Through the use of file sharing, the clients that are requesting a video can share information amongst themselves and can take some of the load off of the original distributor.
SNT.8079.11139	The only draw back to using file sharing is the distribution would not be instant; instead, it would have to be pre-recorded like TiVo.
SNT.8079.11140	Ironically, the movie industry has been suing people for file sharing for years now.
SNT.8079.11141	In the end, this same technology might save the movie industry millions.
SNT.8079.11142	Cerf said, "They are only just now starting to come to honest grips with the possibilities of using the Internet," according to ZDNet Australia.
SNT.8079.11143	Currently, waves of lawsuits against internet file-sharing services continue to be mounted.
SNT.8079.11144	11 countries across Europe and Asia have seen lawsuits filed against individuals by record companies fighting file-sharing technology which they say is costing it billions.
SNT.8079.11145	The total number of lawsuits worldwide is in the range of 12,000.
SNT.40026.11146	A cruise ship caught fire 32 km (20 miles) off the southeast coast of England.
SNT.40026.11147	The blaze started in the engine-room of the Calypso, which had 708 passengers and crew onboard.
SNT.40026.11148	Specialist firefighters transported by helecopter from the East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service tackled the fire.
SNT.40026.11149	It was tugged to Southampton by the Anglican Monarch, a tug boat jointly operated by England and France.
SNT.40026.11150	The relieved passengers left to boat 16 hours after the fire started.
SNT.40026.11151	"A team will be going onboard to assess the situation, so time will tell," said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokeswoman.
SNT.277304.11152	At least four people died and forty were injured Saturday night as the result of a stage collapsing at the Indiana State Fair, located within the US state of Indiana.
SNT.277304.11153	The Indianapolis Star has attributed the incident to poor weather.
SNT.277304.11154	A storm with wind speeds as high as 60 miles per hour (96 kilometres per hour) had been reported.
SNT.277304.11155	Captain Brad Weaver, an Indiana State Police employee, described witnessing "the framework from the stage start to come over", having given a public safety announcement shortly prior to the collapse.
SNT.277304.11156	Numerous patients, including adults and children, have been admitted to hospital.
SNT.277304.11157	Weaver claimed that the incident could not have been prevented.
SNT.277304.11158	Video footage of the incident, which has now emerged online, displays witnesses screaming as the rigging falls down.
SNT.277304.11159	One witness, who has been identified only as Chris, informed the BBC of the events he sighted.
SNT.277304.11160	"We could see the sky get really dark and there was lightning and thunder."
SNT.277304.11161	"It almost seemed like a hurricane hit out of nowhere."
SNT.277304.11162	"The stage just leaned to the right and crashed down."
SNT.277304.11163	"It felt to me like it was in slow motion."
SNT.277304.11164	"Everyone was scrambling and it was horrifying because you knew people were underneath it."
SNT.277304.11165	He described the incident as "the worst thing I have witnessed in my life."
SNT.277304.11166	David Lindquist, a journalist for The Indianapolis Star, described the scenario as "bad, very bad", and that one "could clearly see people were under the footprint of the rigging."
SNT.277304.11167	Freeing trapped victims from underneath the wreckage took rescue workers under twenty minutes, according to Lindquist.
SNT.277304.11168	A Twitter account representing the Indiana State Fair confirmed the fatalities and stated that their "prayers are with the families of all affected".
SNT.277304.11169	At the time of the incident — approximately 2100 EST Saturday night or 0000 UTC Sunday morning — US country music band Sugarland were about to perform.
SNT.277304.11170	Band members Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles spoke out after the accident on social networking website Twitter.
SNT.277304.11171	"We are praying for our fans, and the people of Indianapolis."
SNT.277304.11172	Sara Bareilles, another scheduled performer at the event, also commented on Twitter.
SNT.277304.11173	Bareilles said she was "speechless" and felt "hopeless" in the aftermath of the situation.
SNT.81578.11174	As many as 3,200 mine workers became trapped in the in Elandsrand mine, a gold mine in South Africa about 50 miles (80 km) west of Johannesburg in Carletonville, Gauteng, after an incident on October 3.
SNT.81578.11175	All miners have been rescued, and none of them were injured.
SNT.81578.11176	The mining company says that a lift electrical cable broke on a basket that was carrying miners, trapping thousands at least 2,200 meters (1.3 miles) below the earth's surface.
SNT.81578.11177	Reports from MSNBC and the Guardian Unlimited say that the shaft may have collapsed when a water or air pipe burst.
SNT.81578.11178	The rescue operation went well with no complications, with the rescue taking just under 24 hours to complete.
SNT.81578.11179	"They were underground when the accident happened and they were not able to surface because an electric feeder cable that is connected to the mine lift was severed," said a spokeswoman for the mining company, Amelia Soares.
SNT.81578.11180	The snap was caused by a "fatigued" air pipe which burst and fell down the shaft damaging the "steelwork and electrical feeder cords," added Soares.
SNT.81578.11181	"There have been no injuries or deaths," said CEO of Harmony mining, Graham Briggs who also said that the miners were previously contacted and were given "food and water."
SNT.81578.11182	Earlier reports had stated that Lesiba Seshoka, a spokesman with the National Union of Mineworkers, said that the miners have not been heard from for hours and that they could have been enduring temperatures as high as 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
SNT.81578.11183	"The only exit is blocked, probably by a fall of ground," said Seshoka.
SNT.81578.11184	Rescue workers used a mine shaft that is next to the damaged one in an attempt to reach the trapped miners, and lifted them out, 75 at a time.
SNT.81578.11185	There was no emergency exit in the shaft which is reported to have "not been maintained for ages," added Seshoka.
SNT.81578.11186	"An escape route is the most important thing and they have failed miserably."
SNT.81578.11187	"Our main worry is for more than 3,000 people who are underground," said National Union of Mineworkers for S. Africa chairman, Deon Boqwana.
SNT.81578.11188	Current reports say that "negligence" was the initial cause for the pipe burst and that there has been a history of negligence from the mine.
SNT.81578.11189	"Because of continuous operations there is no time to make adequate checks," said the President of the Miners union, Senzeni Zokwana to reporters during a news conference.
SNT.81578.11190	The Elandsrand mine is currently under development and has been since February 2001 when Harmony bought the mine.
SNT.81578.11191	Officials state that the mine will remain closed for a minimum of six weeks, while an investigation is performed, and the mine is deemed safe for miners to continue working in it.
SNT.81578.11192	The mine is located in the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa, which is said to be the location of the largest area of raw gold on the planet.
SNT.16888.11193	Outgoing Iranian president Mohammad Khatami said that the proposed nuclear fuel work would not include producing enriched uranium, but stressed that Iran would ultimately resume its uranium enrichment programme.
SNT.16888.11194	Khatami told reporters "Whether Europeans mention our right to resume activities at the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan or not, we will definitely resume them regardless."
SNT.16888.11195	Iran has consistently maintained that it has a right to develop its own nuclear fuel cycle from its indigenous uranium resources to produce power.
SNT.16888.11196	Though Iran has large oil stocks, environmental concerns and the Kyoto Protocol may preclude their continued development.
SNT.46038.11197	The results of the appeals in the massive Italian football match-fixing scandal have today been announced by the Italian federal court.
SNT.46038.11198	Juventus originally were relegated to Serie B with a thirty-point deduction.
SNT.46038.11199	Their appeal still sees them in Italian football's second division, but with their points deduction almost halved to seventeen.
SNT.46038.11200	They will still have their last two Scudettos stripped off them and the 2005-06 title will not be assigned to anyone.
SNT.46038.11201	They will also have to play three games behind closed doors.
SNT.46038.11202	AC Milan will remain in Serie A and with their points deduction reduced from fifteen to just eight.
SNT.46038.11203	However, importantly, they have been reinstated into the Champions League, but will have to play in the third qualifying round.
SNT.46038.11204	Fiorentina and Lazio have been reinstated into Serie A, having been demoted into Serie B originally.
SNT.46038.11205	However, both clubs have had their points deductions increased, in Fiorentina's case the deduction was twelve points and Lazio will start the season with -11 points having originally had a seven-point penalty.
SNT.46038.11206	Both clubs will not be allowed to play in European competitions next season and will have stadium bans.
SNT.46038.11207	Fiorentina must play three games behind closed doors and for Lazio it's two.
SNT.27985.11208	Carlos Ortega, one of the top opposition leaders in Venezuela, has been sentenced to 15 years in jail for inciting civil unrest during a strike.
SNT.27985.11209	Following a military coup d'etat in 2002, the two-month strike battered the country's oil industry in a effort to oust the elected president Hugo Chavez.
SNT.27985.11210	"From prison, I'll keep working, I'll keep fighting to preserve the freedom, democracy and unity of the people," said Mr Ortega in a telephone interview.
SNT.27985.11211	"I'm no conspirator or coup plotter and I didn't betray my country."
SNT.27985.11212	While Ortega had initially fled Venezuela following the issuing of an arrest warrant in 2003, the BBC reports that he had returned to Venuzuela from Costa Rica last August.
SNT.27985.11213	Supporters of Mr Ortega have claimed the verdict is 'politically motivated' according to BBC reports, with an appeal being planned.
SNT.27985.11214	Mr Ortega's opposition to current Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is well known.
SNT.27985.11215	Chavez himself attempted (and failed) to carry out a military coup in 1992.
SNT.27985.11216	Since then, Chavez was democratically elected president in 1998, 2000, and survived a recall referendum against him in 2004, and the constitutional reform referendum which he supported was supported by over 70% of the population in 1999.
SNT.263489.11217	Pakistani militants killed ten soldiers and injured fifteen more during an attack on PNS Mehran, a military base in Karachi, in a revenge strike after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
SNT.263489.11218	Commandos have cleared the base of militants; three of the attackers were reported also to have been killed.
SNT.263489.11219	The militants reportedly took hostages inside the base but officials said they all had been rescued unharmed.
SNT.263489.11220	Military forces continued to fight off the militants on Monday morning, hours after the attack began the night before when as many as twenty militants stormed hangars at the base and used rocket-propelled grenades to destroy a number of military aircraft, including a P-3C Orion.
SNT.263489.11221	Witnesses reported hearing a number of loud explosions and heavy gunfire as the militants continued to attack the base.
SNT.263489.11222	"They were carrying guns, rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades," a spokesperson for the Pakistan navy said.
SNT.263489.11223	Yusuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, said the attack was a "cowardly act of terror".
SNT.263489.11224	Reports last night indicated hostages may have been taken at the base, but officials have confirmed all foreigners at the base are safe and any hostages taken have been freed.
SNT.263489.11225	Commandos moved in after the attack begun and fighting continued throughout the night, and more loud explosions and gunfire were heard in the base on Monday morning.
SNT.263489.11226	Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the attack; a spokesperson said it was a revenge attack for the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. special forces earlier this month.
SNT.263489.11227	"It was the revenge of martyrdom of Osama bin Laden," the spokesperson said.
SNT.263489.11228	"It was the proof that we are still united and powerful."
SNT.263489.11229	The group warned after the death of bin Laden that they would attack Pakistani military targets.
SNT.37555.11230	With the actual poll only days away, Thailand's Administrative Court has ruled against a new requirement introduced by the country's Election Commission.
SNT.37555.11231	Voters will not be forced to complete ballots with a rubber stamp and may instead use a pen.
SNT.37555.11232	Ruling that the change to require the use of a rubber stamp is in contravention of election law, Judge Anuwat Tharasawaeng highlighted that election law does not mandate how a mark must be made on the ballot.
SNT.45184.11233	Israel's naval ships have entered Lebanon's territorial waters to enforce a blockade on the Levantine state, Thursday.
SNT.45184.11234	"Since this morning Israeli naval vessels have enforced a full naval closure on Lebanon, because Lebanon's ports are used to transfer both terrorists and weapons to the terror organizations operating in Lebanon," a spokesman for Israeli Army said.
SNT.45184.11235	The spokesman did not comment on whether Israel had also blockaded Lebanon's airspace.
SNT.45184.11236	However Israeli aircraft attacked Beirut's Rafik al-Hariri International Airport, Thursday morning, which damaged the main runway and forced incoming flights to divert to Cyprus.
SNT.45184.11237	Israel's Army Radio said that other airports might also be targeted in order to restrict access to Lebanon.
SNT.45184.11238	"We will take all necessary measures to bring an end to the rogue behavior of a state that does not assume responsibility and put an end to the activities of a major partner in their own government," said Israeli Cabinet Minister Isaac Herzog to Reuters.
SNT.45184.11239	The government in Beirut has said it accepts no responsibility for what Hezbollah claimed was the capture of two Israeli soldiers, in an attack which injured six Israeli civilians.
SNT.45184.11240	27 civilians have been killed so far in Israeli raids on Lebanon.
SNT.76692.11241	As residents of the Big Island of Hawaii continue to make preparations for Hurricane Flossie, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake rocked the Big Island at 7:38 p.m. local time last night.
SNT.76692.11242	The earthquake jolted an area about 20 miles south of Hilo.
SNT.76692.11243	There were no immediate reports of injuries from the earthquake, as of late Monday night.
SNT.76692.11244	However, Tom Brown, a spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense did report that the quake caused a small landslide.
SNT.76692.11245	Parts of Hawaii are already under hurricane watches, tropical storm warnings, and flash flood watches as Hurricane Flossie approaches.
SNT.76692.11246	Public and private schools alike closed early Tuesday morning as residents and visitors were warned to stock up on food and water.
SNT.76692.11247	Meteorologists predict the eye of the category three storm will pass less than 100 miles from the islands, leaving parts of Hawaii exposed to strong winds and up to 15 inches of rain.
SNT.76692.11248	However, meteorologists also express caution in saying that even a slight change in course could take the storm closer to land.
SNT.76692.11249	The Hawaii National Guard has been activated under the command of Governor Linda Lingle, who signed an emergency disaster proclamation ahead of the storm.
SNT.76692.11250	Mayor Harry Kim also declared a state of emergency on Monday.
SNT.76692.11251	The last time a hurricane struck the state was in 1992, when Hurricane Iniki devastated the island of Kauai.
SNT.76692.11252	Six people were killed and over $2.5 billion in damage was caused.
SNT.85568.11253	The video on YouTube has been viewed over 1.3 million times, and there are numerous parodies using the quote.
SNT.85568.11254	T-shirts and coffee mugs with the slogan are also selling well.
SNT.85568.11255	The phrase has also become notable enough to merit an article on Wikipedia.
SNT.85568.11256	The situation brings attention to changes Chávez has proposed to the Venezuelan constitution, which would lift the restriction on the number of terms for the President of Venezuela.
SNT.37293.11257	Early exit polls for the Israeli parliamentary elections suggest that the newly formed Kadima party of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Acting PM Ehud Olmert managed to capture between 28 and 32 seats in the 17th Knesset with Labor coming in second with 20 to 22 seats ahead of Yisrael Beiteinu with 12 to 14 seats.
SNT.37293.11258	Likud got 11 or 12 seats, the National Religious Party took 8 or 9 seats and Shas 10 or 11 seats.
SNT.37293.11259	The Pensioners party performed better than expected, capturing 6 to 8 seats, United Torah Judaism got 5 to 6 seats and Meretz around 5 seats.
SNT.37293.11260	Arab parties are expected to get 7 or 8 seats.
SNT.37293.11261	The results mean that Olmert could probably form a center-left coaltion to implement his unilateral disengagement plan for the West Bank.
SNT.37293.11262	"The next prime minister is Ehud Olmert," said Roni Bar-On, a Member of the Knesset for Kadima.
SNT.37293.11263	His party did worse than expected from opinion polls, which saw them at gaining about 40 seats.
SNT.37293.11264	"This a crisis unlike any that has ever hit Likud," said Dan Naveh, a senior MK of the party referring to Likud's fall from being one of the dominating Israeli parties in the last decades to finishing only 4th.
SNT.37293.11265	Correspondents for the BBC stress that Israeli exit polls are considered to be relatively unreliable, and that it may take some time to get definitive results.

SNT.57010.11272	The New Zealand government has announced that the new minimum purchasing age to buy fireworks in New Zealand is 18-years instead of the current age of 14-years.
SNT.57010.11273	Also the amount of time fireworks are available for sale during Guy Fawkes has been restricted to three days before Guy Fawkes night instead of ten days.
SNT.57010.11274	The New Zealand Fire Service has welcomed the new restrictions despite them calling for a complete ban.
SNT.57010.11275	The Environment minister, Honourable David Benson-Pope, said: "This aims to restrict young teenagers from purchasing these potentially harmful explosives, and to make the Guy Fawkes season less taxing for the Fire Service and Police."
SNT.57010.11276	"We want to see fireworks users behaving responsibly, being aware of and avoiding fire risk, guarding the personal safety of themselves and others, and being aware of the effect the noise has on animals."
SNT.57010.11277	Further restrictions have also been announced which will ban the separate sale of sparklers.
SNT.57010.11278	Sparklers will only be available for purchase in packs contained with other fireworks.
SNT.57010.11279	This restriction is to try and prevent the dangerous, home-made "sparkler bombs."
SNT.57010.11280	Mike Hall, chief executive of the New Zealand Fire Service, said that he is pleased with the new restrictions around the sale of fireworks.
SNT.57010.11281	"I met with the minister in November and expressed the Fire Service’s concerns, and it’s good to see that some action has come out of that."
SNT.57010.11282	In response to why the government had not banned the complete sale of fireworks, Hon Benson-Pope said: "I have listened to the various groups that do want a ban, and I am still open to that possibility in the future, but I believe the best approach at this stage is to tighten up the laws around sale."
SNT.57010.11283	The government has asked the Environmental Risk Management Authority to investigate the fireworks available for purchase in regards to the style, design and the construction of the various fireworks.
SNT.57010.11284	"...and next year government will consult with industry about new regulations in this area," Hon Benson-Pope said.
SNT.57010.11285	Mr Hall said: "Obviously we won’t know whether or not the measures Mr Benson-Pope has introduced will go far enough until the Guy Fawkes period in 2007, but we certainly hope they will limit the chaos we have seen in the past couple of years."
SNT.57010.11286	Hon Benson-Pope said: "Guy Fawkes is a fun event for thousands of families, and fireworks-related damage is caused by a small group of mostly young people."
SNT.57010.11287	"I don't feel it's fair on New Zealanders to ban fireworks sales at this stage because of the actions of a minority."
SNT.57010.11288	"I understand the frustration the Police and Fire Service teams feel when faced with problems over Guy Fawkes, and I hope these new restrictions will send a message that deliberate harm or damage is criminal and is being clamped down on," Mr Benson-Pope said.
SNT.88162.11289	On Wednesday, United States President George W. Bush signed into law a US$555 billion appropriation bill, called the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (aka H.R. 2764).
SNT.88162.11290	The bill will keep government agencies running through September 2008.
SNT.88162.11291	It also includes US$70 billion, which will fund the military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan well into 2008.
SNT.88162.11292	The signing of the bill concluded a battle between Bush and the United States Congress, during which he threatened to use his Presidential veto.
SNT.88162.11293	Even so, Bush complained about the final outcome of the bill:
SNT.88162.11294	"I am disappointed in the way the Congress compiled this legislation, including abandoning the goal I set early this year to reduce the number and cost of earmarks by half."
SNT.88162.11295	”Instead, the Congress dropped into the bill nearly 9,800 earmarks that total more than $10 billion.”
SNT.88162.11296	”These projects are not funded through a merit-based process and provide a vehicle for wasteful Government spending," Bush said in a press release from the White House.
SNT.102748.11297	English football club Manchester United has beat Liverpool 3–0, making it six points clear at the top of the table for United.
SNT.102748.11298	The match, which started at 13:30 local time featured several bookings and a red card for Javier Mascherano (Liverpool).
SNT.102748.11299	The half time score was 1–0 to Manchester United, with the other two goals being scored in the second half.
SNT.102748.11300	The goal, scored by Wes Brown, was headed into the goal after a cross by Wayne Rooney.
SNT.102748.11301	The second goal was scored by Christiano Ronaldo, was also scored through a header, although this goal was scored seconds after a shot by the same player.
SNT.102748.11302	The third and final goal was scored by Luis Nani, just two minutes after the goal by Ronaldo.
SNT.102748.11303	The goal was shot into the left hand side of the goal.
SNT.42004.11304	A raid involving 50 members of the Swedish National Criminal Police has taken the servers of The Pirate Bay and Piratbyrån (the Pirate Bureau) — a Swedish lobby organisation that originally developed The Pirate Bay — into custody.
SNT.42004.11305	The search warrant was given on grounds of alleged copyright violation and assisting copyright violation.
SNT.42004.11306	This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as the legality of the site has been under public debate for over three years, with the operators frequently issuing public press releases.
SNT.42004.11307	WiredFire, in an interview with Rickard Falkvinge, head of the Swedish Pirate Party, is reporting that police arrested three staff members, ultimately taking only two into custody.
SNT.42004.11308	The Associated Press, however, is reporting that Ulf Goranzon, a police spokesman, is claiming that none were arrested, they were just under suspicion of violating copyright law.
SNT.42004.11309	The site operators speculate that the police wish to test the legality of the operation.
SNT.42004.11310	Purportedly, this move comes due to political pressure exerted by United States media corporations.
SNT.42004.11311	However, The Pirate Bay claimed that as they only host .torrent files and not copyrighted material, they are not in contravention of copyright laws.
SNT.42004.11312	The Pirate Bay also served as a distribution point for freely licensed material such as some Linux distributions and independent music and film.
SNT.42004.11313	The Pirate Bay claims to be the world's largest BitTorrent tracker.
SNT.42004.11314	In the raid, the police also took several private servers unconnected to The Pirate Bay.
SNT.42004.11315	Some have claimed that there is no legal basis for these seizures.
SNT.42004.11316	Initially, there were also rumors that this could be another stunt by The Pirate Bay to promote awareness.
SNT.42004.11317	This possibility, however, has been already dismissed and only had some credibility given the fact that approximately one year ago today they claimed something similar like this, but instead were simply updating their servers.
SNT.42004.11318	At current there are already some publications made available by officials confirming the authenticity of the raid.
SNT.42004.11319	On June the 1st The Pirate Bay site changed its "Site down" note to "Site down - will be up and fully functional within a day or two".
SNT.42004.11320	The day after the raid, Mr. Svartholm is trying to limit the damage for PRQ's other customers that also had their servers confiscated, even if they didn't have any connections to The Pirate Bay.
SNT.24225.11321	A rainy day in Victoria, the provincial capital of British Columbia, failed to dampen the spirits of protesting teachers and their labour union supporters on Monday as thousands turned out to make their voices heard and, incidentally, shut down the city's transportation services.
SNT.24225.11322	The local transit union was not involved in the strike, their offices were picketed by striking Telus workers.
SNT.24225.11323	Across northern B.C. thousands of Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) members are off the job in solidarity with the teachers.
SNT.24225.11324	In Prince George a rally is planned to be held in front of the office of Education Minister Shirley Bond.
SNT.24225.11325	"If solutions aren't found, on Wednesday of this week, another massive shutdown in a different area of this province will take place," shouted Jim Sinclair, B.C. Federation of Labour president, to a crowd gathered on the lawn of the Legislature yesterday.
SNT.24225.11326	Inside, the opposition NDP used Question Period to repeatedly probe the ruling Liberal party's decision to not speak with the BC Teacher's Federation (BCTF).
SNT.24225.11327	Carol James asked Gordon Campbell what the difference was between this strike and that held by the Hospital Union (HU) in 2004 - also an illegal strike.
SNT.24225.11328	The Premier's response was that he personally did not negotiate with the HU, and the rule of law was supreme: teachers must return to the classroom before negotiations over a bargaining process for next year's contract may begin.
SNT.24225.11329	The strike is back in court again this week, with Supreme Court Judge Brenda Brown saying she will rule Friday on requests the union be slapped with additional fines for refusing to call off the strike after the civil contempt of court ruling last week.
SNT.24225.11330	The union and leaders may also face criminal charges after the government appointed Len Doust as an independent special prosecutor to assess whether criminal contempt charges may be brought.
SNT.49300.11331	India's former External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh has, for the first time, been directly accused by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for his involvement in the Iraq oil scam.
SNT.49300.11332	The ED, which is responsible for enforcing foreign exchange control laws, has alleged that Singh, along with his son Jagat Singh and three others, acquired foreign exchange worth $8.9 lakh illegally.
SNT.49300.11333	The 18-page show-cause notice issued by the ED says the money was acquired by the accused, in violation of U.N regulations, in exchange for two oil contracts awarded to Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO).
SNT.49300.11334	Of the $8,90,000, $7,48,550 was allegedly transferred by them to an account in the Jordan National Bank, the remaining $1,46,247.23, which was the commission for the oil-contracts, was deposited with Barclays Bank, in the Channel Islands.
SNT.49300.11335	The money was transferred to an account in the name of Indus Trading Company, which itself is owned by Andaleeb Sehgal, a friend of Mr. Singh.
SNT.49300.11336	The accused are required to respond to the show-cause notice (issued on the 2nd of September), which Natwar says is an attempt by the ED to "defame" him, within 30 days.
SNT.49300.11337	The independent Pathak Commission's report had stated that there was "no material evidence to show that Natwar Singh derived any financial or other personal benefits from the contracts."
SNT.21240.11338	The offices of DirectNIC, a New Orleans based webhost and services provider, were visited by armed members of the 82nd Airborne Division during an interview with Wikinews reporters Tuesday evening.
SNT.21240.11339	DirectNIC has been the home of "Outpost Crystal" — an information dissemination effort involving hundreds of volunteers throughout the world — since Hurricane Katrina wracked the United States Gulf Coast last Monday.
SNT.21240.11340	Armed police and military are currently patrolling the devastated city to protect residents and property.
SNT.21240.11341	While New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin has ordered a "forced" evacuation of the city, it is not apparent yet whether these orders are being executed by law enforcement agencies.
SNT.21240.11342	DirectNIC personnel indicate that they will be allowed to stay as they constitute part of the recovery effort of the city.
SNT.53797.11343	A new strain of Avian Flu or Bird Flu has been discovered in China and has also infected some humans.
SNT.53797.11344	The virus also "spreads fast" and has covered a "big geographic region" according to Chinese health officials.
SNT.53797.11345	It is not known how dangerous the new virus is and whether it is stronger or deadlier than the current H5N1 virus.
SNT.53797.11346	Despite being detected in humans, no evidence has turned up to suggest that the virus can be spread easily from human to human.
SNT.53797.11347	"The new variant doesn't indicate any increased risk for people other than the fact it seems to be pretty widespread," said World Health Organization's [WHO] Global Influenza Program, which is located in Zurich, Switzerland, Doctor Michael L. Perdue.
SNT.53797.11348	"This virus seemed to spread very fast over a big geographic region."
SNT.53797.11349	"However, we don't have any evidence to show whether this virus is more dangerous or less dangerous than any other H5N1 viruses," said State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong in China director, Yi Guan.
SNT.53797.11350	The strain was discovered during April and June of 2006 in China's Fujian Province when Guan's team examined ducks, chickens, geese and other birds at a market in the province.
SNT.53797.11351	At least 95% of the birds Guan and his team looked at were infected with the new strain and vaccines formulated to fight the H5N1 virus have not worked.
SNT.53797.11352	"This novel variant may have become dominant ... because it was not as easily affected as other strains by the avian vaccine used to prevent H5 infection."
SNT.53797.11353	The team is continuing surveillance on the area where the strain was discovered and according to Guan the virus "is not causing widespread infection outside of our surveillance area" but the new strain is reported in Thailand, Laos, Hong Kong and Malaysia.
SNT.53797.11354	Scientists also say that current vaccines used in birds for the H5N1 virus might have caused the new strain to develop.
SNT.113288.11355	On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election.
SNT.113288.11356	Christian Heritage Party candidate Steven Elgersma is standing for election in the riding of Haldimand—Norfolk.
SNT.113288.11357	Wikinews contacted Steven Elgersma, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them.
SNT.113288.11358	Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe.
SNT.113288.11359	All interviews are conducted over e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.
SNT.111659.11360	According to Chaindrawa, Saakashvili's government bears little resemblance to a democracy.
SNT.111659.11361	Rather, Chaindrawa claims that the government of Georgia is an authoritarian regime that suppresses civil liberties and the freedom of the press, similar to the Russian government policies of Vladimir Putin.
SNT.111659.11362	Chaindrawa states that Saakashvili tried to close down an independent TV station (Imelda TV), declared a state of emergency in 2007 against mass protests of the opposition, and committed election fraud.
SNT.111659.11363	Chaindrawa also asserts the politics of Saakashvili's government as a cause of the current war with Russia.
SNT.111659.11364	He says: "He wanted a victory parade in Zchinwali and got Russian troops marching toward Tbilisi".
SNT.111659.11365	When asked why he was dismissed from the government in 2006, Chaindrawa stated that he tried to avoid military adventures in the conflict with South Ossetia and that he was highly critical of Saakashvili's failed 2004 attempt to conquer Zchinwali.
SNT.111659.11366	On the question of what the West should do, Chaindrawa replies that the West should support the Georgian population, its civil society, and its institutions rather than the Saakashvili government.
SNT.111659.11367	He continues to say that Georgia needs politicians who are pursuing reconciliation and compromise rather than confrontation.
SNT.111659.11368	In an article in The Washington Times, Tsotne Bakuria, a former member of the Georgian parliament and now a senior fellow at Global International Strategic Group in the U.S., formulates a similarly harsh criticism of Shakasvili's government.
SNT.111659.11369	She calls its government a "reign of terror" and says that the country has no independent judiciary and that Saakashvili uses trumped-up criminal charges (alleged money laundering) to silence and suppress members of the opposition.
SNT.111659.11370	She describes the leader of the opposition Shalva Natelashvili being forced to ask NATO secretary Javier Solana for asylum for his wife and two daughters after they had received death threats.
SNT.111659.11371	Natelashvili himself was threatened with arrest by a government member and is facing money laundering charges, as are other members of the opposition.
SNT.763716.11372	Fiji's national airline Air Pacific has now officially returned to its original name: Fiji Airways.
SNT.763716.11373	Fiji Airways adopted the Air Pacific name in 1971, slightly prior to its first international flight on June 3, 1973.
SNT.763716.11374	The re-brand was described by interim CEO Aubrey Swift as allowing the airline to align itself "closer with Fiji as a destination".
SNT.763716.11375	The name change is designed in part to reduce the confusion which surrounded the name Air Pacific.
SNT.763716.11376	Swift noted that "Air Pacific just didn’t resonate with our customers" and said that same people "thought we were an air conditioning company".
SNT.763716.11377	Along with the name change, the airline has redesigned its website, and changed the name of each of its classes of service.
SNT.763716.11378	Pacific Voyager and Tabua Class have been replaced with economy and business class respectively.
SNT.763716.11379	The airline has also introduced plans to overhaul its fleet of older Boeing 747s with Airbus A330s.
SNT.763716.11380	It has said that the completion of this overhaul and the re-branding efforts will be completed by the end of the year.
SNT.763716.11381	The airline's new brand-mark and livery features a masi design created by Fijian artist, Makereta Matemosi.
SNT.763716.11382	The new identity is to "symbolises the airline's new identity and epitomises all that Fiji Airways represents."
SNT.763716.11383	"It is authentic, distinctive, and true to the airline's Fijian roots", the airline said.
SNT.84383.11384	Pervez Musharraf has invoked emergency rule in Pakistan according to state television.
SNT.84383.11385	Reports say that police have surrounded the Supreme Court of Pakistan, while the judges are still inside.
SNT.84383.11386	The court is deciding whether Musharraf was eligible to run in last month's election, which he won.
SNT.84383.11387	The Supreme Court has stated that Musharraf does not have the authority to declare the state of emergency, which includes a suspension of the Constitution.
SNT.84383.11388	Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who recently returned home, is currently out of the country, visiting family in Dubai.
SNT.84383.11389	Dawn News, a private television station in Pakistan had stated that sources said that a declaration of emergency rule was imminent.
SNT.84383.11390	Dawn News and other private news organizations then went off the air.
SNT.84383.11391	Some reports are also saying that land and cell lines into the capital are not functioning, but it is not clear if this is deliberate or is due to high traffic or some other concern.
SNT.84383.11392	The United States said that it was "disappointed" by the move while the United Kingdom's foreign secretary said that it was vital that Pakistan "abides by the commitment to hold free and fair elections on schedule".
SNT.44178.11393	Ted Hollis, a criminal attorney from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is suing the creator of a website which allows women to complain about men they have dated after being named by two women on the self-proclaimed controversial site.
SNT.44178.11394	The website, DontDateHimGirl.com, allows women to use a search engine to find alleged deceivers.
SNT.44178.11395	It calls itself "a powerful online resource that lets women out the men who have cheated on or lied to them".
SNT.44178.11396	As well as featuring a discussion board that enables women to criticise partners, the website also includes the names, details, and photographs of so-called cheats.
SNT.44178.11397	Men can respond to postings, but they can't get them erased.
SNT.44178.11398	According to Hollis, two local women claimed the man was, among other things, two-timing.
SNT.44178.11399	Mr Hollis added that he is blameless, and that the website should check the reliability of the information it contains.
SNT.44178.11400	Tasha Joseph, the creator of DontDateHimGirl.com, notes that this is the first lawsuit filed against her website.
SNT.44178.11401	She claims that she cannot be held responsible for the comments of others.
SNT.44178.11402	This is due to her status as a provider, as opposed to a publisher or a writer, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
SNT.142561.11403	Militants in Afghanistan have killed at least six foreign United Nations workers; three Afghans, and a US citizen, during an attack on an international guest-house in the capital Kabul on Wednesday.
SNT.142561.11404	Local officials said three gunmen wearing suicide vests, disguised as police, stormed the compound around dawn that morning.
SNT.142561.11405	They battled security forces for two hours before they either detonated their explosives or were shot dead.
SNT.142561.11406	At least two Afghan security guards and a civilian died in the assault.
SNT.142561.11407	A Taliban spokesman later took credit for the attack, calling it a "first step" to disrupt the planned November 7 presidential run-off election.
SNT.142561.11408	The group called for a boycott of the polls, and threatened violence against anyone who would vote.
SNT.142561.11409	Militants also fired rockets at a luxury hotel and the presidential palace in the capital on Wednesday, but without causing casualties.
SNT.142561.11410	Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the UN, confirmed that six staff for the UN were among the dead.
SNT.142561.11411	"This has clearly been a very serious incident for us."
SNT.142561.11412	"We've not had an incident like this in the past," he said.
SNT.142561.11413	The US embassy released a statement saying that attacking civilian workers will not lessen US support for the Afghan people and their election process.
SNT.142561.11414	The assault came a day after a series of bomb blasts in southern Afghanistan killed eight Americans, making October the deadliest month for US troops in the ongoing eight year war.
SNT.8674.11415	On Monday residents of an apartment building just outside of Paris discovered a World War II bomb lodged in their chimney.
SNT.8674.11416	Officials were able to defuse the device, reports All Headline News.
SNT.8674.11417	However, there are other remnants of the World Wars that have been much more difficult for the French to defuse.
SNT.8674.11418	The prevalence of anti-French sentiments reached a frenzied zenith prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
SNT.8674.11419	While it seemed that the storm had calmed recently, this week's release of Richard Chesnoff's latest book, The Arrogance of the French: Why They Can't Stand Us--and Why the Feeling Is Mutual, reminds us that this issue is not going away anytime soon.
SNT.8674.11420	While there have been fewer sightings of "liberty toast" in recent months, from discussions with students in both the U.S. and France, this reporter found that America's perception of the French remains a hot topic of discussion on college campuses.
SNT.8674.11421	Bryan Doeg, a military science student at the University of Central Florida, outlined the two prevailing thoughts that are the basis for many of these anti-French sentiments.
SNT.8674.11422	"Most of my fellow students feel that the French are politically and militarily weak," said Doeg.
SNT.8674.11423	Doeg believes that he and his classmates are not without reason for their perceptions about the French.
SNT.8674.11424	"They are weak because of France's decline in power over the last century and its defeats against the Germans and Algerians," Doeg said.
SNT.8674.11425	"And most of my experiences regarding their arrogance comes from soldiers who visited France and were treated like untouchables by the locals."
SNT.8674.11426	Southwest Missouri State (SMS) finance major, Fabian Florant, got straight to the point when discussing Doeg's first assumption that the French are weak.
SNT.8674.11427	"Americans hate the French with a passion because of World War I and II," Florant said.
SNT.8674.11428	However some students pointed to France's involvement in the American Revolution, questioning how long America's memory really is.
SNT.8674.11429	Jessica Morgan, an SMS English major, said that this and other examples have shown that France is far from being weak.
SNT.8674.11430	"They stood up against Hitler when he was in his prime for months before he occupied their country," Morgan said.
SNT.8674.11431	"The fact that by the time we got there, the Germans were a heck of a lot weaker than they were when the French had to face them doesn't seem to register."
SNT.8674.11432	Morgan emphasized that France's refusal to support U.S. war efforts is a resounding display of strength.
SNT.8674.11433	"It's somewhat ironic that we call them weak," Morgan said.
SNT.8674.11434	"They stood up to the U.S. as well, daring the disapproval of the U.S. ... and all we can do is throw childish insults back at them."
SNT.8674.11435	Lysiane Lavorel, a native of France and college student studying English there, offered a tongue-in-cheek response to France's supposed weakness while making reference to the 1996 film Independence Day.
SNT.8674.11436	"As for the French being weak, it's true that in comparison with the strong and good Americans preventing aliens from invading the Earth, we are more than weak," Lavorel said.
SNT.8674.11437	"It's true that we don't have any real impact on the world, and I find it much more comfortable that way …"
SNT.8674.11438	"I wouldn't want to feel responsible for a war, for example."
SNT.8674.11439	Doeg's second assumption is that the French are arrogant, and Lavorel agrees again.
SNT.8674.11440	"Yes of course, I think we French are very arrogant," Lavorel said.
SNT.8674.11441	Lavorel went on to explain her definition of French arrogance.
SNT.8674.11442	"It's quite hard for us to see how people [Americans] seem to be so easily manipulated by government, big firms or media," Lavorel said.
SNT.8674.11443	"Because for most French, we have learned to become skeptical, doubtful and to make our own opinion on things.
SNT.8674.11444	However, she pointed out that this is especially true of Parisians, from which she says many of American's perceptions about the French are based.
SNT.8674.11445	"Even in France, they [Parisians] are said to be arrogant," Lavorel said.
SNT.8674.11446	"They are said to consider France as only composed of Paris, and provincial people are just hillbillies."
SNT.8674.11447	An American student at a California university, who asked to remain anonymous to prevent the damage of his reputation among colleagues, said that he would describe 90 percent of the Parisians he has met as being arrogant.
SNT.8674.11448	"In an academic setting, this arrogance is particularly frustrating," the source said.
SNT.8674.11449	"Often the Parisians I know belittle other people when they understand a complicated concept better than another person.
SNT.8674.11450	"On one occasion, a Parisian made a fool out of a good friend of mine," the source said.
SNT.8674.11451	"My friend asked him how to model the eigenfunction of a microdisk resonator with finite-differences time-domain."
SNT.8674.11452	"He said 'everyone knows you can derive these fields analytically."
SNT.8674.11453	The source said that he is not perpetuating these stereotypes and that his preconceived notions do not alter how he perceives these interactions.
SNT.8674.11454	"Often I'll hear someone say something like, 'Oh and be careful when you meet him--he's French," the source said.
SNT.8674.11455	"But you know, 99 percent of the time, all of the stereotypes prove to be perfectly true and the warning is useful."
SNT.8674.11456	SMS media student Lydia Mann, who visited France for two weeks recently and has hosted two French foreign exchange students, said that these perceptions are based upon cultural differences.
SNT.8674.11457	"Americans, I think, misunderstand their culture which leads to their actions," Mann said.
SNT.8674.11458	"They make a point to make themselves individualistic, which people find rude."
SNT.8674.11459	SMS English major Christin Green agrees and believes that this entire discussion that attempts to blanket such a large group of people is ridiculous.
SNT.8674.11460	"I want to learn about them with an open mind and a fresh perspective, unpolluted by bias or preconceived ideas," Green said.
SNT.8674.11461	"It is not my place to judge or make assumptions about an entire people."
SNT.8674.11462	"Stereotypes ruin this foundation and build another one that is much more destructive."
SNT.230997.11463	China has said it is prepared to support eurozone countries during the financial crisis that has hit the sixteen member states.
SNT.230997.11464	The country's foreign ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu said: "We are ready to support the eurozone to overcome the financial crisis and realise economic recovery."
SNT.230997.11465	Several of the eurozone's member states have been impacted with increasing debt levels.
SNT.230997.11466	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Union (EU) have signed deals to hand a €110bn aid package to Greece, and an €85bn rescue package to Ireland.
SNT.230997.11467	Industry commentators have said there are fears Portugal and Spain may soon also have to accept assistance from the IMF.
SNT.230997.11468	Jiang said China had an interest in supporting the region, saying eurozone member states would, in the future, become "a major market" for Chinese foreign exchange investments.
SNT.230997.11469	China reportedly has massive reserves of foreign currency, mostly made up of United States dollars.
SNT.230997.11470	Analysts have suggested China plans to purchase more euros in the future.
SNT.230997.11471	Other reports suggest China is preparing to buy between four and five billion euros to help Portugal fend off pressure in bond markets.
SNT.130066.11472	Food deliveries from the RMT were allowed into the Vestas plant in Newport, England yesterday, but were cut off by Vestas management this afternoon.
SNT.130066.11473	Protesters at the Isle of Wight factory celebrated the delivery of supermarket bags filled with groceries, which entered with a police escort.
SNT.130066.11474	This morning, the sixteen remaining occupiers were told to prepare a list of items for future deliveries.
SNT.130066.11475	But, according to "Mark", an occupier in the Vestas plant, this afternoon Vestas management reversed their decision, terming the August 1 food delivery a one-time "goodwill gesture" and saying food would no longer be allowed in.
SNT.130066.11476	The food delivery followed a formal complaint by the RMT that denying the occupiers food was a violation of their human rights.
SNT.130066.11477	The people inside the factory have been conducting their occupation since July 20, in protest against the closure of the factory, which produces wind turbine blades for the generation of wind power, and the loss of 625 jobs in the Isle of Wight and nearby areas.
SNT.130066.11478	Mark went on to praise the "brave people" who have circumvented the security ring around the plant in order to get food and other items to the occupiers.
SNT.130066.11479	An electric kettle thrown at the end of a rope up to the occupiers is said to be working well.
SNT.130066.11480	Mark also noted that Louise Christian, a prominent British human rights lawyer, is now representing the Vestas occupiers.
SNT.130066.11481	While the number of occupiers at the Vestas plant — originally nearly thirty, now only sixteen — have dwindled, Mark says the ones who remain are "very determined" and furthermore hold no ill will toward their co-workers who have left the occupation.
SNT.130066.11482	In particular, the occupiers offered sympathy for Luke Paxton, who they say left the occupation due to a combination of personal issues and malnutrition brought on by the deprivation of food.
SNT.130066.11483	Paxton, Mark said, has the remaining occupiers' "full support" and continues to campaign for the Vestas workers.
SNT.130066.11484	In contrast to claims that green socialist group Workers' Climate Action were behind the occupation, Mark presented a more nuanced picture: the Vestas workers' initial contacts were with veterans of the occupation of Visteon's auto parts plants, with the AWL, SWP and Socialist Party becoming involved later with "quite a big involvement" from all groups.
SNT.130066.11485	Members of Workers' Climate Action attended Vestas workers' meetings and gave their opinions, but, Mark says, a committee organised by the workers and composed of workers was making all the decisions.
SNT.130066.11486	Mark also strongly rejected the support of Solidarity, a "nationalist trade union" closely associated with the BNP.
SNT.130066.11487	In a July 24 statement, Solidarity backed the Vestas workers, with union executive member David Kerr saying "We are behind the Vestas workers 100 per cent.
SNT.130066.11488	Mark, in reply, told Wikinews: "We do not want their support...they go against a lot of the things people believe in here.
SNT.130066.11489	Most of the Vestas occupiers remain independent of trade unions, with only three of the sixteen people inside being members of any union.
SNT.130066.11490	Mark closed with a message of solidarity with the occupiers of two Thomas Cook branches in Dublin, Ireland, whose employees began a sit-in at their offices on Friday after the announcement of surprise closures.
SNT.130066.11491	"Don't back down...do not be pushed around, do not be intimidated".
SNT.130066.11492	The Vestas occupiers have also exchanged messages of solidarity with SsangYong Motor Company in South Korea.
SNT.130066.11493	Workers at SsangYong have been occupying their factory since May 22 in protest against a 36% cut in employees there.
SNT.130066.11494	The occupation continues accompanied by a warning of increased union unrest in Britain.
SNT.130066.11495	Neil O'Brien of centre-right think tank Policy Exchange told The Daily Telegraph that, while labour unrest had increased, the current state of affairs is "nothing compared to what is going to happen once the brakes are slammed on public spending."
SNT.140549.11496	Typhoon Parma was threatening to strike the Philippines capital of Manila, devastated from Typhoon Ketsana just one week earlier, but has taken a more northerly path, largely sparing the city.
SNT.140549.11497	"It’s a big help, we weren’t ready for another catastrophe," said Marides Fernando, mayor of the Marikina municipality.
SNT.140549.11498	Forecasters say the storm changed course before striking the Cagayan province in the northern part of the country.
SNT.140549.11499	Most of the region is expected to avoid major disaster.
SNT.140549.11500	However, Parma, still packing sustained 10-minute winds of 110 miles per hour, has knocked down trees and powerlines, and is forecast to drop heavy precipitation.
SNT.140549.11501	The most significant impacts may come in the form of mudslides.
SNT.140549.11502	Tuguegarao Mayor Randolph Ting said, "Many houses have been destroyed and trees and electricity poles uprooted."
SNT.140549.11503	"The province hasn’t been hit this hard in 10 years."
SNT.140549.11504	"It will probably take 10 to 15 days for power to be restored".
SNT.140549.11505	In advance of the storm, President Gloria Arroyo issued a "state of calamity" and tens of thousands residents were advised to leave their homes.
SNT.140549.11506	Trevor Taylor, a resort owner in Santa Ana, Cagayan, reported that "The town is locking down; you don’t want to be on the road at this time."
SNT.140549.11507	"We have moved everything that is loose, boarded every window and put extra material on the roof so it doesn’t get blown off."
SNT.140549.11508	"A lot of people here have homes made of flimsy material, and these are likely to suffer a lot of damage."
SNT.140549.11509	All interests in the areas potentially in the path of Typhoon Parma are urged to monitor its progress over the next few days.
SNT.143769.11510	The Ministry of Defence has announced that a British soldier has been killed in an explosion in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan.
SNT.143769.11511	With this announcement, the total number of military personnel that has been killed in Afghanistan has now increased to 231.
SNT.143769.11512	The man was killed on Saturday afternoon after an explosion near the town of Sangin.
SNT.143769.11513	He came from 2nd Battalion, The Rifles, and was serving with 4th Battalion, The Rifles.
SNT.143769.11514	The soldier's family have now been informed of the death, the Ministry said.
SNT.143769.11515	Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield is the spokesperson for Task Force Helmand.
SNT.143769.11516	"He died a soldier, doing his duty and among his fellow soldiers," he said.
SNT.79375.11517	Today on Capitol Hill, U.S. Army General David Petraeus presented a long awaited testimony.
SNT.79375.11518	The number one U.S. commander in Iraq said 30,000 United States troops may be able to leave Iraq by the summer of 2008.
SNT.79375.11519	The top U.S. diplomat in Iraq, Ambassador Ryan Crocker, also joined General Petraeus in the presentation to Congress.
SNT.79375.11520	General Petraeus firstly said that the President's troop escalation in January met its objectives "in large measure."
SNT.79375.11521	Petraeus said, "I believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre-surge level ... by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains we have fought so hard to achieve."
SNT.79375.11522	However, Petraeus would not speak about troop withdrawals past the summer of 2008 until March, saying, "Our experience in Iraq has repeatedly shown that projecting too far into the future is not just difficult, it can be misleading and even hazardous."
SNT.79375.11523	The General recommends the government withdraw a Marine expeditionary team by the end of September 2007, and a brigade combat unit in December of 2007.
SNT.79375.11524	Petraeus also recommended, "reduction of eight further brigade teams and the battalion combats in 2008 until we reach the pre-surge levels of 15 brigade combat teams by mid-July 2008."
SNT.79375.11525	Petraeus presented Congress with a number of charts and graphs showing a decline in violence overall in Iraq.
SNT.79375.11526	"The level of security incidents has declined in eight of the past 12 weeks, with the level of incidents in the past two weeks the lowest since June of 2006," Petraeus testified.
SNT.79375.11527	Ambassador Crocker said that while he "cannot guarantee success" in Iraq, withdrawing completely now would result in failure.
SNT.79375.11528	President Bush reportedly will use Petraeus and Crocker's recommendations as a base for his report to Congress.
SNT.79375.11529	A senior administration official said it is "very likely" that President will speak in a prime-time address this week.
SNT.43367.11530	Japan and Croatia drew 0-0 in the heat of Nuremburg, Sunday.
SNT.43367.11531	Both teams worked hard and had clear chances to score but lacked the necessary ruthlessness in front of goal.
SNT.43367.11532	On a hot field and under the blue sky in the Frankenstadion the conditions won as the match petered out at a walking pace.
SNT.43367.11533	In the first period Japan's goal keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi kept Japan in the game.
SNT.43367.11534	Kawaguchi dived low to his left to save Darijo Srna's driven penalty after Dado Prso had been knocked down from behind by Tsuneyasu Miyamoto.
SNT.43367.11535	The yellow card for the central defender and captain of the Japan team meant he would miss Japan's next match against Brazil.
SNT.43367.11536	The Japanese keeper was centre of the action again when the Croatian coach's son Niko Kranjcar turned brilliantly and rattled the crossbar from 25 yards.
SNT.43367.11537	With half an hour gone Kawaguchi got a shock - a bouncing back pass bobbled one meter in front of him.
SNT.43367.11538	Fortunately for Japan though it evaded his control the ball trickled just wide of the post.
SNT.43367.11539	Overall, their physical presence meant they were dangerous from their 11 corner kicks and were capable of making space to shoot from the edge of the area.
SNT.43367.11540	If Zlatko Kranjcar might have wished for more luck in front of goal, Japan coach Zico might also rue the lack of finishing from his team.
SNT.43367.11541	Both sides gave their best in the heat and deserved their first Fifa World Cup point.
SNT.43367.11542	The result did not play either team out of the World Cup but the advantage in Group F remained with Brazil and Australia who had three points after the first games.
SNT.23287.11543	Google Inc. formally submitted a bid to provide free wireless internet, or WiFi, in response to a request from Mayor Gavin Newsom's office.
SNT.23287.11544	The company's goal is to ensure easy, reliable access to its search engine at all times.
SNT.23287.11545	In another sign of its interest in Internet access, Google recently bought an undisclosed stake in a Maryland startup, the Current Communications Group, which is trying to provide high-speed connections through power lines.
SNT.48358.11546	The European leaders who met on Thursday in Brussels announced that Italy would be likely to take command of the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon(UNIFIL), but France is to remain in command until February 2007.
SNT.48358.11547	Poland, Spain, Belgium and France are to send soldiers with Switzerland and Great Britain sending military expert units to Lebanon.
SNT.48358.11548	Germany will not be sending land troops due to historical reasons.
SNT.48358.11549	Ireland called for 9000 soldiers to be sent soon, whereas Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French Foreign Minister maintained that only 7000 are to be sent.
SNT.48358.11550	The French President Jacques Chirac declared during a conference with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel that there not more than 15,000 "blue helmets" will be stationed in Lebanon, calling this number "definitely excessive".
SNT.48358.11551	The Israeli Prime Minister's spokesman Avi Pazner, speaking after the French announcement of sending 2000 soldiers, said "11,000 soldiers would still be missing".
SNT.49426.11552	Liberal leadership hopeful Ken Dryden outlined his vision of the country today.
SNT.49426.11553	He wants Canada to be a fair, global, environmental and learning society.
SNT.49426.11554	"What I'm trying to focus on is the educational systems as part of a whole piece of what I call a learning society," Dryden told CTV's Canada AM this morning.
SNT.49426.11555	"We learn from the day we are born and we learn until the day we die."
SNT.49426.11556	"The challenge is finding ways of enhancing learning through a national system of early childcare and a proper mix of scholarships and government help, such as grants and tax incentives," said Dryden.
SNT.49426.11557	Dryden admitted during a news conference that he doesn't know whether Canadian troops should withdraw or stay in Afghanistan or whether a carbon tax should be part of any climate change plan.
SNT.49426.11558	He has now called for a thorough debate and examination of the issue.
SNT.49426.11559	Other leadership hopefuls are planning big policy announcements this week as they head into the few weeks before delegates are chosen to attend to leadership convention in December.
SNT.108633.11560	On Wednesday, a United States federal appeals court upheld convictions of fraud and obstruction of justice against media mogul Conrad Black, along with three other executives from his former press corporation, Hollinger International.
SNT.108633.11561	Black, born in Canada and bearer of the title Baron Black of Crossharbour in the United Kingdom, was found guilty in July 2007 of three counts of wire and mail fraud for giving himself and others millions of dollars in illegal bonuses taken from Hollinger holdings, and for obstruction of justice based on surveillance footage of his moving 13 boxes of documents out of his Toronto office to his home the day after he was informed that he was being investigated.
SNT.108633.11562	He was sentenced, and from March this year he began a 6 1/2-year prison term.
SNT.108633.11563	Peter Atkinson and John Boultbee were convicted on the same fraud charges, and were sentenced to terms of 24 and 27 months respectively, while Mark Kipnis, who was implicated in the fraud, was given probation with 6 months of home detention.
SNT.108633.11564	The appeals panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, who heard the defence attorneys' oral arguments, presented its opinion in a 16-page document in which they rejected arguments against the fraud and obstruction charges.
SNT.108633.11565	They noted that while the defence had presented a "no harm-no foul argument", in which it was argued that the accused were owed the money appropriated, "such arguments usually fare badly in criminal cases".
SNT.108633.11566	They also dismissed claims that instructions given to the jury by the judge had been incomplete, or unclear, stating that "the defendants proposed a misleading statement as an alternative", and that in such situations the judge is allowed to stay with the original instruction, and in particular is not required "that a submitted charge be technically perfect to alert the court to the need for a particular charge".
SNT.108633.11567	The appeals judges also discounted arguments from the defence regarding the defendants being unaware of the illegality of the transactions, making reference to an "ostrich argument", based on the urban legend that ostriches sensing danger stick their heads in the sand.
SNT.108633.11568	It was noted that choosing not to investigate the suspicious nature of the payments was equivalent to accepting their illegality.
SNT.108633.11569	An argument from Black's defence regarding the obstruction charge, that in moving the documents he was not in fact escaping scrutiny, was similarly rejected, as "all that needed to be proved is that the document was concealed in order to make it unavailable in an official proceeding," according to the ruling as written by Judge Richard Posner.
SNT.108633.11570	Andrew Frey, the defence attorney for Conrad Black, said that the court's decision was based on "a number of factual misunderstandings", and that the defendants were considering a request for a rehearing of the appeal.
SNT.15302.11571	Research by a team from Canada have published a report in the magazine Science stating that seabirds are the main carriers of pollution in coastal ponds in the Arctic.
SNT.15302.11572	They showed that local sources of pollution are rare, meaning that seabirds played a proportionally greater role in local pollution.
SNT.15302.11573	They do not produce pollution themselves, rather, they carry in other forms of marine pollution.
SNT.15302.11574	The researchers found levels of DDT 60 times higher, 25 times more mercury, and 10 times higher hexachlorobenzene in ponds that seabirds frequented compared to nearby ponds birds did not use.
SNT.15302.11575	All the pollution was originally of human origin - industrial or agricultural.
SNT.211789.11576	Health Minister of Chile, Jaime Mañalich, announced on Friday the rescue of the 33 Chilean miners trapped in San José Mine, Copiapó is to begin this Tuesday, October 12.
SNT.211789.11577	Mining Minister Laurence Golborne announced that the tunnel the miners will ascend "will be ready in the next 24 hours.
SNT.211789.11578	"The rescue will take place between three and eight days (after finishing the perforation), depending on the decisions that are taken about the encamisado (process of coating the tunnel with a metal pipe)," Golborne added.
SNT.211789.11579	He also said the miners "have no anxiety," saying that "they've waited a few months now for their rescue and are aware that they will have to wait some more days."
SNT.17174.11580	Armed police officers from SO19 have raided properties in the Notting Hill and North Kensington areas of London and Italian forces have arrested the fourth bombing suspect at a property in Rome, Italy.
SNT.17174.11581	The raids were in connection with the failed bombings on July 21.
SNT.17174.11582	Scotland Yard have announced that a number of arrests have been made, and that three of the suspected July 21 bombers are now in custody.

SNT.17174.11584	Officers in full body armour, helmets and gas masks and armed with shotguns and assault rifles were seen moving in.
SNT.17174.11585	Small explosions were heard soon after, and CS gas and stun grenades are also believed to have been used.
SNT.17174.11586	Police are cautioning that CS grenade launchers and explosive entries could be mistaken for shots, and have said that no shots were fired.
SNT.17174.11587	Police at one point described the raid as entering a "challenging phase".
SNT.17174.11588	Eyewitnesses said that the police asked one person in a building that was surrounded to give himself up.
SNT.17174.11589	Muktar Said Ibrahim, one of two suspects named after the failed 21 July bombing attempts, is also known as Muhammad.
SNT.17174.11590	The other officially-named suspect has already been arrested in Birmingham.
SNT.17174.11591	At one point the cordon around the area was expanded, cutting off TV news stations from their broadcast vehicles which were caught inside the sealed-off area.
SNT.17174.11592	Two weeks before the failed attacks of July 21, a series of bombs on July 7 killed 56 people, including four suicide bombers.
SNT.87895.11593	Last Tuesday in Taipei, Google Taiwan held an annual summary press conference named "Collective Intelligence & Innovation" (In Chinese: 匯聚智慧、集體創新).
SNT.87895.11594	With many products had already been presented to the public like wikis, blogs, and photo albums in the Web 2.0 era, Google served to provide lots of services like Google Apps, Google Maps and YouTube with suitable versions in Taiwan differing other countries this year.
SNT.87895.11595	Global Deputy Director of Google Kai-Fu Lee said: "The contents on the Internet were mostly limited with some copyright issue in the past, but after many products in the Web 2.0 era are presented, several contents are progressively released and opened to the public in the presence."
SNT.87895.11596	Also in this conference, the Engineering Director of the Google Taiwan R&D Center Li-feng Chien also announced the achievements on the "Google Taipei Developers' Day" and invited developers named Chi-pao Hu and Yi-ru Lin to share some actual applications on iGoogle.
SNT.229932.11597	In the Scottish Premier League (SPL), Kilmarnock F.C. defeated Hibernian F.C. 2-1 on Saturday.
SNT.229932.11598	Nine minutes into the game in Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, Scotland, Liam Kelly became the first player of the game to score for Kilmarnock.
SNT.229932.11599	He achieved a second goal for his team 43 minutes after the game commenced.
SNT.229932.11600	In the second half of the match on the snow-covered field, Derek Riordan scored one goal for his team Hibernian at 55 minutes, which was also his 100th career goal for the team.
SNT.229932.11601	Liam Miller of Hibernian was given a red card after clipping Conor Sammon 80 minutes into the game.
SNT.229932.11602	Referee Craig Thomson decided this rulebreaking occurred immediately outside of the penalty area.
SNT.229932.11603	Kilmarnock's position in the SPL table now increases to fifth.
SNT.229932.11604	"The attitude and the sort of tempo of how we're going about it in the second half is just sort of the place in the right direction where I feel we've gotta go."
SNT.229932.11605	In a separate BBC Sport interview, Kilmarnock manager Mixu Paatelainen commented: "I thought for the first half we were excellent."
SNT.229932.11606	"You know, the surface was quite tricky today because it was a little bit snowy and the ball skids along but, you know, that possibly helped our passing game."
SNT.229932.11607	"You know, [Liam Kelly] was sharp, he was quick, he passed round players and he scored two excellent goals."
SNT.229932.11608	"The second half was a little bit stickier for us, owing to Hibs."
SNT.229932.11609	"They put us under pressure but, you know, thankfully our defence did their job and we only conceded one goal which was a fantastic strike from Riordan."
SNT.69764.11610	Newcastle United received a £133.1m ($263m) offer from English billionaire businessman Mike Ashley on May 23, 2007 to buy the club.
SNT.69764.11611	Ashley said in a statement "Newcastle United has a wonderful heritage and the passion of its fans is legendary."
SNT.69764.11612	"I am sure that, like me, they are already excited about the prospects for next season under the new manager's stewardship."
SNT.69764.11613	Ashley is already the largest shareholder in Newcastle United and currently runs Sports World International, the largest sporting goods retail in the United Kingdom.
SNT.52282.11614	Internet users on the Chinese-forums.com website report that the longtime block of Wikipedia by China has been at least temporarily lifted.
SNT.52282.11615	Absent an announcement from the Chinese government, it's unclear what the conditions were that caused the site to be accessible from within China.
SNT.52282.11616	A blog by Wikipedia contributor Andrew Lih says that someone in "Beijing emailed me saying he could suddenly start using Wikipedia again.
SNT.52282.11617	He continued that "from a Beijing China Netcom's residential DSL connection, the English language and other foreign language versions are now accessible, but the Chinese version is still blocked", noting that the Chinese-language version is the most important one to most Wikipedians in the country.
SNT.52282.11618	The blog entry goes on to explain the finer points of China's blocking system, which is more complex than most media outlets suggest.
SNT.52282.11619	Wikimedia head Jimmy Wales told Moneycontrol.com yesterday that, "We don't know what they took offense to."
SNT.52282.11620	"We really don't intend to compromise the way Google did."
SNT.52282.11621	"I am trying to set up high-level meetings in China to state our case and explain why we should be unblocked."
SNT.52282.11622	"We have no idea what the result of that would be."
SNT.52282.11623	"Wikipedia is not a haven for dissidents but an encyclopedia."
SNT.52282.11624	"About 99.9 percent of Wikipedia has topics that are not of interest to the Chinese Government."

SNT.52282.11626	The third block of Wikipedia, which was implemented 19 October 2005, was issued without explanation or an expected length.
SNT.52282.11627	Wikipedia has been blocked twice before, the first from 2-21 June 2004, due to the 15th anniversary of the Tian'anmen Square Incident.
SNT.52282.11628	A website called baidu.com runs a self-censored wiki-based encyclopedia website, called baidubaike.com, launched in April of this year.
SNT.52282.11629	Wikipedia is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organisation based out of St. Petersberg, Florida.
SNT.52282.11630	Its 2007 annual convention, Wikimania, is set to take place in Taipei.
SNT.43853.11631	Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in the allied invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraqi oil production figures have been bleak.
SNT.43853.11632	However, new signs are being revealed that Iraqi oil output is at its best since the fall of Hussein.
SNT.43853.11633	The Iraqi oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, stated that about 2.5 million barrels of oil are now produced per day, a figure that has seen a rise lately.
SNT.43853.11634	During the invasion of Iraq, lead by the United States, oil output was at about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) and before the invasion oil production ranged from 3 million to, at its peak, 3.5 million bpd.
SNT.20492.11635	Today, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin visited the president and discussed a number of urgent matters, such as the help proposed to the United States following from the disastrous Hurricane Katrina.
SNT.9065.11636	A UCLA team, headed by Brian Naranjo, has observed the nuclear fusion of deuterium nuclei in a tabletop device.
SNT.9065.11637	The device uses a lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) pyroelectric crystal to ionize deuterium atoms and accelerate the ions towards a stationary erbium deuteride (ErD) target.
SNT.9065.11638	Fusion of two deuterium nuclei results in the emission of helium nuclei (alpha particles), neutrons and gamma rays.
SNT.9065.11639	The team anticipates applications of the device as a tabletop neutron generator, or in "microthrusters" for space propulsion.
SNT.9065.11640	It is possible that there may be applications related to nuclear weapons, although this possibility is not discussed in the research paper.
SNT.9065.11641	This development is not related to earlier claims of tabletop fusion or "cold fusion" having been observed during sonoluminescence.
SNT.9065.11642	In fact, the leader of the team behind this development was one of the main critics of earlier low-temperature fusion claims.
SNT.9065.11643	This device is not the first reliable tabletop fusion device; the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor, developed in the early 1960s in the laboratory of Philo T. Farnsworth who was instrumental in developing television, is sold commercially as a neutron source.
SNT.9065.11644	Research by Dr. Todd Rider of MIT suggests that the kind of non-equilibrium fusion produced in these sources will never be usable as an energy source (see his PhD thesis).
SNT.123578.11645	Richard Jenkins, an engineer from the United Kingdom, broke a record for the fastest speed attained in a wind-powered land vehicle on Friday.
SNT.123578.11646	Jenkins managed to reach a speed of 126.1 miles per hour (202.9 kilometres per hour) in his Greenbird car along the plains of Nevada's Ivanpah Lake.
SNT.123578.11647	Jenkins said that he had worked for ten years to break the record, and that "things couldn't have been better" on the day he broke the record.
SNT.123578.11648	"It's one of those things that you spend so long trying to do and when it actually happens, it's almost too easy," he said to the BBC.
SNT.123578.11649	"Half the challenge is technical, having to create a more efficient vehicle than the previous record holder, then the rest is luck, being in the right place, at the right time, to get the perfect conditions, with the right people watching."
SNT.123578.11650	"I must have been on record standby at some remote location around the world for at least two months of every year for the past ten years," he said.
SNT.123578.11651	"Then everything came together perfectly and the Greenbird stepped up to the mark and performed amazingly.
SNT.123578.11652	The previous record for the fastest wind-powered land vehicle belonged to Bob Schumacher from the United States, who reached 116 miles per hour in his Iron Duck machine.
SNT.123578.11653	The Greenbird is a fifth generation in an array of vehicles created by Jenkins in his ten-year effort to break the speed record.
SNT.123578.11654	It is composed out of carbon fibre composite, and powered only by wind.
SNT.270770.11655	Jamaican Olympic athlete and coach Pablo McNeil has died at the age of 71.
SNT.270770.11656	The cause of death was a long illness he suffered since a stroke in December 2007.
SNT.270770.11657	A sprinter since childhood, McNeil competed at two Olympic Games.
SNT.270770.11658	In the 1964 Tokyo Games he reached the semi-final of the 100 meters, finishing sixth.
SNT.270770.11659	He also appeared in the 100 meters at the 1968 Games in Mexico City, but failed to make it past the first round.
SNT.270770.11660	He was part of the relay team that won a silver medal at the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica.
SNT.270770.11661	After a career of competing in athletics, McNeil turned his attention to coaching.
SNT.270770.11662	He became the sprint coach at the William Knibb High School where he met Usain Bolt.
SNT.270770.11663	He convinced Bolt to make the switch from cricket to track and trained him up until the age of 16, when Bolt joined the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association-administered High Performance Training Centre in Kingston.
SNT.270770.11664	Bolt, through his publicist, said that "Coach McNeil was a part of my early track and field life."
SNT.270770.11665	"I appreciate all he sought to pass on to me."
SNT.270770.11666	"I would like to offer my condolences and sympathies to his family and close friends."
SNT.270770.11667	Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture, Olivia Grange paid tribute to McNeil in a statement saying “Pablo McNeil has left a mark on Jamaican and world sports."
SNT.270770.11668	"He was a good competitor for Jamaica and went on to nurture, mentor, inspire and coach some of our fine young athletes at William Knibb High School - including Usain Bolt who has been such a success and inspiration."
SNT.270770.11669	"On behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, I offer sincerely condolences to Pablo McNeil’s family, friends, and the entire Track and Field fraternity who will be saddened by his passing."
SNT.141283.11670	Gabon's constitutional court has upheld Ali Ben Bongo's win in the August presidential election.
SNT.141283.11671	Nine opposition candidates had challenged those results, alleging vote fraud.
SNT.141283.11672	After recounting results from more than 2,800 polling stations, Gabon's constitutional court confirmed the election of the son of the country's long-time leader Omar Bongo.
SNT.141283.11673	Announcing the results on state television, constitutional court president Marie Madeleine Mborantsuo reaffirmed Ali Ben Bongo's win with nearly 42 percent of the vote.
SNT.141283.11674	Former interior minister Andre Mba Obame and opposition leader Pierre Mamboundou each finished with about 25% of the vote.
SNT.141283.11675	But the recount changed their order, with Mamboundou now finishing slightly ahead of Obame.
SNT.141283.11676	Mborantsou said that the court annulled results from one polling station.
SNT.141283.11677	With Bongo winning more votes than any of his opponents, she said his election as the president of the Republic of Gabon is confirmed.
SNT.141283.11678	The court's decision was final, and cleared the way for the president-elect's inauguration.
SNT.141283.11679	The ruling rejects an electoral challenge by Obame, Mamboundou and other opposition candidates who accused electoral officials of massive vote fraud to benefit Bongo.
SNT.141283.11680	Obame has gone on a hunger strike to deplore what he called "the installation of an era of dictatorship" in Gabon.
SNT.141283.11681	He says fraudulent results are a humiliation for the massive numbers of people who voted for change.
SNT.141283.11682	Bongo was considered the front-runner in the election since his father's death in June, after 42 years in power.
SNT.141283.11683	Former colonial power France welcomed his election, saying the vote took place under "acceptable conditions."
SNT.141283.11684	Most electoral observers agree the vote was generally fair despite irregularities that included security forces at polling stations, some ballot boxes not being properly sealed, and the absence of opposition representatives during some vote counting.
SNT.141283.11685	When Bongo was first announced the winner following August's vote, police dispersed opposition demonstrators in the capital with tear gas.
SNT.141283.11686	Protesters in the city of Port Gentil burned the French Consulate and attacked offices of French and U.S. oil firms.
SNT.141283.11687	Human-rights groups say at least 15 people were killed by security forces.
SNT.141283.11688	Interim President Rose Francine Rogombe says an investigation is under way to determine who is responsible for that violence.
SNT.98557.11689	Irish airline Ryanair took a 12% slump in this morning’s trade, further intensifying concern about poor market conditions amid recessionary fears.
SNT.98557.11690	Today, Ryanair announced a 27% drop in pre-tax profits in its third quarter net profits.
SNT.98557.11691	Further falls are predicted for the company in its next fiscal year.
SNT.98557.11692	"With oil prices at $90 a barrel and fear of recession in the UK and many other European economies, the current outlook for the coming fiscal year is poor."
SNT.98557.11693	"While it is impossible to accurately forecast full year fuel prices and yields this far in advance, there is now a significant chance that profits may decline next year," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary cautioned.
SNT.98557.11694	Ryanair said that it is not hedged against oil price increases for the next fiscal year.
SNT.98557.11695	However, Ryanair is not the only airline to suffer from the economic downturn.
SNT.98557.11696	However shrewd, Mr. O’Leary has plans to spend up to 200 million purchasing back shares in the company, which equates to 3% of the company share capital.
SNT.144609.11697	Afghan officials have said that a rocket apparently fired at a luxury hotel in Kabul injured four people today, despite falling short of its target.

SNT.144609.11702	Taliban militants fired rockets at the same hotel last month, which is heavily guarded.
SNT.144609.11703	No one was injured in that attack, which came on the same day that a suicide-bomb explosion killed five UN staff members and two Afghans at their quarters in another part of Kabul.
SNT.144609.11704	Taliban militants also attacked the Serena Hotel in January 2008, in a commando-style assault that killed at least eight people.
SNT.51919.11705	The Free State Cheetahs and the Blue Bulls will meet next week in the 2006 Currie Cup final, South Africa's domestic club rugby competition.
SNT.51919.11706	The Bulls were the first to go through, winning the first semi final against rivals Western Province, and the Cheetahs won their semi against the Sharks.
SNT.51919.11707	The Blue Bulls hosted WP at home, at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria.
SNT.51919.11708	The Blue Bulls led WP 20 to nine at half time.

SNT.51919.11710	At the second semi-final at Bloemfontein, the Cheetahs hosted the Sharks at the Free State Stadium.
SNT.51919.11711	The Free State were up 17 to nil during the first half.
SNT.51919.11712	The score was furthered to 24 points, but the Sharks' JP Pietersen scored minutes before the half finished to give the Sharks their first points, and the game went onto halftime, Cheetahs leading 24-7.
SNT.51919.11713	The Cheetahs will host the final next week, being the highest place finalist (first, the Blue Bulls were second).
SNT.51919.11714	The final will be the third Blue Bulls/Cheetahs affair in a row, and the fifth Blue Bulls appearance in a row.

SNT.144251.11719	"The eleven people were killed when rustlers stormed a village in Kisima area early this morning," he commented.
SNT.144251.11720	The state-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation puts the number of attackers at 300, and stated that they stole an unknown number of livestock.
SNT.144251.11721	Cattle rustling is common in Kenya, and the extended drought has heightened competition for scarce sources of food.
SNT.144251.11722	In mid-September, 30 people were killed in a shootout as rustlers from the Pokot tribe attacked the Samburu tribe and made off with hundreds of cattle.
SNT.12374.11723	Zimbabwean President Mugabe's Operation Murambatsvina ("Drive out rubbish") has seen at least 200,000 people made homeless in Zimbabwe as the government bulldozes "illegal" homes, buildings and markets.
SNT.12374.11724	The opposition has said the operation is designed to "punish" those who object to Mugabe's government.
SNT.12374.11725	Two children under the age of two have been killed, the first deaths reported so far in the actions which have been taking place for a month now.
SNT.12374.11726	British Foreign Minister Jack Straw has been joined by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in condemning the evictions and urging African leaders to speak out.
SNT.12374.11727	The government has said the buildings it is destroying are "illegal", and have said that the "black markets" are to blame for the country's "economic meltdown".
SNT.12374.11728	The bulldozers have the protection of armed police as they do their work.
SNT.12374.11729	Sometimes the police have forced homeowners to carry out the destruction themselves.
SNT.12374.11730	At other times, the government has claimed it is destroying the buildings to get rid of unsafe structures and to reduce overcrowding.
SNT.12374.11731	Other children have died when the walls of their houses have collapsed.
SNT.12374.11732	The authorities are also preventing non-governmental organisations from providing aid to those who have lost their homes.

SNT.121477.11738	"The plane was nose up and the tail section was at a 45-degree angle."
SNT.121477.11739	"The tail section broke down first, which broke off," said a witness in an interview with the BBC who was riding on his bicycle by the airport when the aircraft crashed.
SNT.121477.11740	"And seconds after the crash people started exiting through the tail section [...]"
SNT.121477.11741	"I saw dozens of people making it out very quickly, and as I was about to dial 112 the first sirens were noticeable, and within five minutes there were 10 or 15 ambulances."
SNT.121477.11742	During the press conference, it was stated that a total of 60 ambulances went to the crash site and 150 medical people were present.
SNT.121477.11743	Special vehicles were also used to enter the field, which wasn't easily accessible.
SNT.121477.11744	"We cannot say anything about the cause at the moment."
SNT.121477.11745	"The priority of the authorities is providing help and care," stated the vice-mayor of the Haarlemmermeer municipality, Michel Bezuijen.

SNT.241376.11751	The president of Egypt has suffered a "devastating blow" after the country's army announced they would not use force against their own people, who continue to protest against the government tonight.
SNT.241376.11752	The news came hours after six journalists who reported on the protests were released from custody.
SNT.241376.11753	Hosni Mubarak yesterday announced a new cabinet, which does not include several figures who protesters largely do not approve of.
SNT.241376.11754	Analysts have, however, suggested little had changed within the government; many positions, they say, are filled with military figures.
SNT.60100.11755	Garth Turner Member of Parliament (MP) for Halton, has joined the Liberal Party of Canada after months of being an Independent MP.
SNT.60100.11756	Turner was elected with the Conservative Party of Canada in the January 2006 election, but was suspended in October from the Party after posting critical blog posts.

SNT.60100.11759	"He is an outspoken advocate for fiscal prudence, progressive values and environmental sustainability, and I know Mr. Turner’s constituents of Halton will only be better served by his decision today."
SNT.60100.11760	Now there is only one independent MP in the House of Commons being André Arthur for the riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier in French speaking Quebec.
SNT.60100.11761	In the video he says the Conservatives have an extreme right-wing agenda.
SNT.60100.11762	He also adds that it is better to be in a Party than being independent.
SNT.105246.11763	Nine people have died in a fiery tourist bus crash in Egypt on Thursday.
SNT.105246.11764	The bus was carrying 40 North American and European passengers when it crashed in the Sinai peninsula.
SNT.105246.11765	The bus left the road when it skidded off a tight bend and struck a concrete barrier, rolling over and catching fire.
SNT.105246.11766	The bus ended the roll back the right way up and was completely destroyed by the fire.
SNT.105246.11767	One wheel lay twelve metres from the main wreckage and skid marks were left on the road.
SNT.105246.11768	The coach had been travelling from a resort at nearby Sharm el-Sheikh to the capital Cairo when it crashed at Abu Zenima, with some reports suggesting the cause was a blowout on a tyre.
SNT.105246.11769	According to the Egyptian security official eight Russian nationals were killed, as was one of two drivers on board, both of whom were Egyptian.
SNT.105246.11770	This was contradicted by Russian state owned service RIA Novosti, which stated just two Russians were among the dead.
SNT.105246.11771	The Russian foreign ministry only said 16 Russians were injured and none killed, also contradicting the Egyptian security official who said only 14 people were injured in total.
SNT.105246.11772	The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a Ukrainian woman had been killed and the Romanian foreign ministry said a 41-year-old Romanian woman was amongst the dead.

SNT.105246.11780	Road accidents claim around 6,000 lives and injure 30,000 every year in Egypt.
SNT.105246.11781	This high accident rate is fed by poor maintenance and regulatory enforcement and reckless driving, with many roads allowing high rates of speed to be achieved.
SNT.105246.11782	A fog-triggered pile-up killed 29 in February, and 23 died in March in a head-on collision between two lorries.
SNT.105325.11783	Early Cinco De Mayo celebrations were interrupted after a suspicious package caused the closure of a busy street in Buffalo, New York's Allentown District.
SNT.105325.11784	For nearly three hours on Monday May 5, 2008 a busy street, popular with bars and hotels, was shut down while authorities examined the package.
SNT.105325.11785	According to Buffalo Police spokesman Mike DeGeorge, workers in the offices on the 500 block of Delaware Avenue witnessed a suspicious person placing a suspicious package inside a United Parcel Service (UPS) drop box at around 4:30 p.m. EDT (UTC-4).
SNT.105325.11786	"It is my understanding that at about 4:30 this afternoon, a call went out for a suspicious person."
SNT.105325.11787	"Police responded and it appears there may have been a suspicious individual who was acting somewhat suspicious when he threw or tossed a package into a UPS box," DeGeorge stated to reporters.
SNT.105325.11788	"The individual had a package under his jacket which tipped off the person as being suspicious."
SNT.105325.11789	"He dropped the package into the [box], and made his way out to Delaware Ave. towards Allen," stated Buffalo Police Lt., K Szyszkowski.
SNT.105325.11790	When police arrived on scene, they evacuated the offices at 570 and the New York State Health Department building at 584 Delaware Avenue, while the Erie County Bomb Squad was called in to examine the drop box and the packages.
SNT.105325.11791	The street between Allen and North was shut down to traffic while police secured the scene.
SNT.105325.11792	When Wikinews freelance reporter Jason Safoutin arrived on scene, at least 20 people were standing outside the buildings, most of whom appeared to be office employees.
SNT.105325.11793	At approximately 6:10 p.m., the bomb squad arrived along with a K-9 unit.
SNT.105325.11794	The commander of the bomb squad, Daniel Walczak entered the area between the buildings where the drop box was at about 7:15.
SNT.105325.11795	He then opened the box and examined several packages with an X-ray machine, but found nothing to indicate an explosive device was present.
SNT.105325.11796	After about 15 minutes, Walczak exited the area with the suspect packages.
SNT.105325.11797	"It was a regular envelope, a UPS container about 18 inches by a foot and a half."
SNT.105325.11798	"As of right now, I am not going to get into anything about the package weight until we go through a thorough investigation," stated Walczak to reporters.
SNT.105325.11799	All of the packages will be sent to a laboratory for further analysis.
SNT.105325.11800	Police would not say what might have been inside the packages.
SNT.105325.11801	Allentown is home to two major hotels and over a dozen bars, but is no stranger to suspicious activity.

SNT.49327.11805	Rambukwella noted that the government's troops received little or no resistance as they took the 10-km swath of land.
SNT.49327.11806	Overnight shelling and mortar attacks from the Tamil Tigers, the main rebel group involved in the fighting, killed one government soldier and injured several others.
SNT.49327.11807	The objective of the incursion, said Rambukwella, was to neutralize the use of three Tamil Tiger guns aimed on government troops to the south.
SNT.49327.11808	Tamil Tigers are claiming that they have not fled the area, and are continuing to engage government troops.
SNT.18097.11809	On a CNN Wolf Blitzer Late Edition broadcast Sunday, U.S. Senators George Allen (R-VA) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) both told Blitzer that in the furore created by the protest they believe President Bush should personally meet with Cindy Sheehan.
SNT.18097.11810	She is the mother of a soldier son killed in Iraq in April 2004, and leader of a protest march now camped near the presidential ranch in Crawford, Texas.
SNT.18097.11811	After returning from commercial break, Blitzer told his guests that CNN had just received a news bulletin from the White House.
SNT.18097.11812	The bulletin said that Bush had met previously with Sheehan in the summer of 2004.
SNT.18097.11813	Both Senators and Blitzer withheld further comment on the matter during the remaining segment of the show.
SNT.18097.11814	Later that day, Cindy Sheehan herself appeared on CNN Sunday with Blitzer and said she did meet with Bush in Seattle with fifteen or sixteen other families.
SNT.18097.11815	She defended her current protest by saying, "The whole meeting was simply bizarre and disgusting."
SNT.18097.11816	Sheehan said that Bush entered the meeting chamber with an insensitive comment to those present, "Who we'all honorin' today?"
SNT.18097.11816-1	She added, "His mouth kept moving, but there was nothing in his eyes or anything else about him that showed me he really cared or had any real compassion at all."
SNT.18097.11817	"This is a human being totally disconnected from humanity and reality."
SNT.18097.11818	The angry mother of the fallen U.S. soldier on Saturday led a protest march of nearly 50 on the Bush ranch.
SNT.18097.11819	Cindy Sheehan of Vacaville, California demanded, but was denied, the chance to speak with Bush and personally ask him, "'Why did you kill my son? "
SNT.18097.11819-1	"What did my son die for?"
SNT.18097.11820	Sheehan was met outside the ranch, after progress of the march was stopped by Texas troopers and the Secret Service, by national security adviser Steve Hadley and deputy White House chief of staff Joe Hagin.
SNT.18097.11821	Sheehan, unsatisfied with the meeting, vowed to remain camped outside the ranch until she is granted a personal interview with Bush.
SNT.18097.11822	Meanwhile, Bush arrived in Albuqerque, New Mexico Monday where he signed into law the new energy bill.
SNT.18097.11823	He will travel back to his Texas ranch this week to meet with his defense and economic advisers, then later, he will travel to Illinois to sign a highway bill.
SNT.18097.11824	Cindy Sheehan said Sunday that she plans to hold the roadside peace protest near Bush's ranch until he talks to her again.
SNT.18097.11825	Cindy's current comments are a drastic change from her comments in a 2004 interview with THE REPORTER of Vacaville, CA.
SNT.18097.11826	"I now know he's sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis," Cindy said after their meeting.
SNT.18097.11827	"I know he's sorry and feels some pain for our loss."
SNT.53762.11828	Wellington, New Zealand, airport has denied supporters of New Zealand's National party to use its land for its newest billboard advertising.
SNT.53762.11829	Bill English, National member, said: "Vicious attacks on critics by Helen Clark and her Labour-led Government have led to Wellington Airport turning down a National Party billboard as it was too politically sensitive."
SNT.53762.11830	However the sign has been put up in Auckland, State Highway 20 and on Christchurch's Main North Road.
SNT.53762.11831	"The billboards are being paid for from party funds and highlight the scandals and controversies that have surrounded Helen Clark during her time as Prime Minister."
SNT.53762.11832	"The airport company has every right to decide who advertises on airport property, but last year Wellington Airport accepted billboards critical of the Government," English said.
SNT.53762.11833	The billboard states on it: "painter-gate, corn-gate, doone-gate, speed-gate, pledge-gate and (next to an arrow) departure gate," all these words were accompanied by a picture of Helen Clark, PM, which slowly decreased in size.
SNT.53762.11834	And then, at the bottom next to the National logo, it said: "Proudly paid for by supporters of the National Party - with their own money."
SNT.53762.11835	Wellington Airport will not comment on why they declined the billboard on its property.
SNT.53762.11836	Louise Murray, a spokesman for the airport, said: "The airport reserves the right to decline any advertising."
SNT.53762.11837	Murray made no comment on how the decisions are made or why this particular billboard was rejected.
SNT.53762.11838	"However, Wellington Airport, like everyone else, saw Helen Clark's assault on the Auditor-General and Labour's plans to legislate to stop people who don't belong to political parties criticizing the Government next election."
SNT.53762.11839	"These actions have created a climate of fear and more so for a company doing business with Government-owned Air New Zealand," English said.
SNT.124735.11840	According to the head of Kenyan seafarer's program, Somali pirates have hijacked another vessel from the United States.
SNT.124735.11841	An American-owned tugboat from Italy along with its 16 member crew was hijacked around 11 am EST on Saturday in the Gulf of Aden.
SNT.124735.11842	The Italian Ambassador, Pierandrea Magistrati, confirmed that "there is a boat that has been hijacked, I believe by Somali pirates."
SNT.124735.11843	Additionally, Shona Lowe, a spokeswoman at NATO's Northwood maritime command center reported that the Italian-flagged tugboat was hijacked this morning off of Somalia's northern coast.
SNT.124735.11844	Lowe also confirmed that Italian government officials along with the company that owned the tugboat were trying to secure the release of the crew, ten of which were Italians.
SNT.124735.11845	Andrew Mwangura, the head of the East African Seafarers' Assistance Program, said that maritime industry sources also reported that the U.S. tugboat was towing two barges at the time it was attacked.
SNT.124735.11846	The contents of those barges is not known at this time.
SNT.124735.11847	Meanwhile, U.S. Captain Richard Phillips of the U.S. Maersk Alabama is still being held hostage, for a fourth day, by four other Somali pirates.
SNT.124735.11848	Phillips, who voluntarily surrendered himself to the pirates in order to protect his crew, is being held in a lifeboat despite an attempt to escape.
SNT.58836.11849	In Pakistan, the Daily Times reported that construction work on a sewerage project has started in Pindi.
SNT.58836.11850	It said that the construction work for the Rawalpindi Environment Improvement Project (REIP) aims to lay a new underground drainage and sewerage system in the area.
SNT.58836.11851	The project director of REIP, Aslam Sabzwari, said, according to the report, that improvement of sanitation and sewerage system had started in the eastern zone of the city, consisting of 15 union councils (UCs).
SNT.58836.11852	The project includes improvement of the sanitation and sewerage systems, a sewage treatment plant, solid waste management, removal of slaughter-houses and construction of public toilets.
SNT.58836.11853	Sabzwari also said that 22 new tube wells would be installed, while 32 old ones would be repaired under the project, recalling that the existing sewerage systems in Satellite Town and Kahyabane-Sirsyed were laid in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively, and were the main cause of the increasing case of hepatitis in the city.
SNT.58836.11854	Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Punjab government sponsor the REIP.
SNT.145289.11855	A classified European Union report for 2009 says Israel is actively pursuing the annexation of east Jerusalem.
SNT.145289.11856	The report accuses Israel of implementing an intricate policy including expanding Jewish settlements and demolishing Palestinian homes.
SNT.145289.11857	It says policies "are undermining prospects for a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem and incrementally render a sustainable two-state solution unfeasible"; this is described as, "an integral part of a broader Israeli strategy."
SNT.145289.11858	Israeli Foreign ministry spokesperson, Yigal Palmor, told AFP that the report was "dishonest", "reflects the Palestinian propaganda" and "is based exclusively on Palestinian versions and figures."
SNT.145289.11859	This comes as EU foreign ministers prepare a statement on the Middle East.
SNT.145289.11860	To allow for US initiatives, EU foreign ministers have not commented on the stalemate between Israel and the Palestinians over past months; but, diplomatic sources say there are “sensitivities" over a Swedish proposal to divide Jerusalem in any peace deal.
SNT.145289.11861	Citing official Israeli statistics from the Ministry of Interior executive director of Israel’s HaMoked (Center for the Defence of the Individual) said Wednesday that, "Israel has stripped Palestinians of Jerusalem residency status last year at a faster rate than at any time in the history of the state".
SNT.145289.11862	4,577 residents of East Jerusalem have had their residence revoked in 2008, this is more than half the total revoked in the past 40 years.
SNT.145289.11863	The Jerusalem municipality places severe restrictions on issuing building permits for Palestinian houses in east Jerusalem, since 2000 over 600 Palestinian-owned structures have been demolished and Palestinians receive fewer than 200 of the 1,500 building permits needed per year.
SNT.145289.11864	The 14-page annual report dated November 23 was drafted by European envoys and consuls in Jerusalem and Ramallah and presented to Brussels EU institutions a few days ago.
SNT.145289.11865	This is the first time the annual report has been made public.
SNT.145289.11866	Haaretz says, in the past, Israel has pressed the EU not to publish fearing it would undermine the European public's view of Israel.
SNT.145289.11867	The report was leaked to Israel's Haaretz daily newspaper and obtained by AFP yesterday.
SNT.145289.11868	The EU report claims the Israeli government and Jerusalem municipality discriminate against Arab residents with regard to building permits, health services, education, sanitation and more.
SNT.145289.11869	Allegations of assisting private right-wing Jewish organisations, such as Ateret Cohanim and Elad, to alter the city's demographics are included.
SNT.145289.11870	The report advises sanctions against people and groups involved in "settlement activity", and taking other measures to protest Israeli policy and to stop the harming of the Arab population, including an "EU presence at Israeli court cases on house demolitions or evictions of Palestinian families when there is a risk of demolition or eviction of Palestinian families", and "information sharing on violent settlers in East Jerusalem to assess whether to grant entry to the EU."
SNT.145289.11871	The report also recommends implementing measures to strengthen the Palestinian National Authority's presence in the city.
SNT.145289.11872	Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem near the Temple Mount are mentioned, suggesting "archaeology in this case has become an ideologically motivated tool of national and religious struggle carried out in a manner that modifies the identity and character of the city and threatens to undermine its stability."
SNT.98618.11873	The fourth day of New York Fashion Week debuted few daring designs even from designers known for such work.
SNT.98618.11874	With few exceptions, the overwhelming theme was "old is new" and that the '70s were even more in fashion than the shows on Sunday suggested.
SNT.98618.11875	Among the designers to unveil their Fall 2008 lines on Monday were Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera, Betsey Johnson, Proenza Schouler and a rejuvenated Halston line, under the direction of designer Marco Zanini.
SNT.98618.11876	Both global warming and the slowing economy have been cited as reasons for the overwhelming use of lighter fabrics over heavier attire.
SNT.98618.11877	Also, retro designs and continuing trends have been used in effort to save money, like the tights that were expected to go out of fashion this year.
SNT.98618.11878	Even in the glamorous world of high-end fashion, money has been tight, and with the world economies in a collective downturn, major designers have been more wary of continuing to churn out the stream of couture designs that past Fashion Weeks have seen.
SNT.98618.11879	The lone daring designer for the day was Carolina Herrera, who discarded the furs she promoted in the Fall 2007 show to focus on a Peter Pan theme, with earth tones and bird feathers.
SNT.98618.11880	To further the "flying Peter Pan" motif, models donned such designs as a chiffon dress with ostrich feathers and a taffeta gown with a feather waistband.
SNT.98618.11881	Oscar de la Renta opted for more traditional blacks, golds and grays, debuting lines for men and women in fabrics he is familiar with.
SNT.98618.11882	Men were outfitted in tweed while women were fitted in dresses that experimented with embroidery and tulle, both shades of past collections.
SNT.98618.11883	Among others, labels Badgley Mischka, Diesel, and Vivienne Tam unveil their newest collections on Tuesday.
SNT.14946.11884	Reacting to the suicide bombing yesterday in a Netanya mall, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) entered the city of Tulkarem.
SNT.14946.11885	The city has been governed by the Palestinian Authority (PA), since March 22nd this year.
SNT.14946.11886	In addition, a general closure was ordered on the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
SNT.14946.11887	The closure will hold until the assessment of the situation changes, according to the IDF.
SNT.14946.11888	The IDF ordered a curfew on Tulkarem at the beginning of the operation, at 2:30 a.m. (+3 UTC), Palestinians reported.

SNT.14946.11890	One Palestinian policeman was killed and one was injured, as well as two Israeli soldiers, when the Israeli forces came under fire while entering the city, according to the IDF spokesperson.
SNT.14946.11891	The IDF arrested five wanted Islamic Jihad members in the city.
SNT.14946.11892	According to IDF officers, the operation is aimed at the Islamic Jihad organization, which staged the suicide attack in Netanya yesterday, as well as another suicide bombing attempt in a Jewish settlement in Samaria.
SNT.14946.11893	The Israeli government asked the PA to arrest the wanted terrorists numerous times, according to high-ranking officers in the IDF.
SNT.14946.11894	"The main objective is to locate Islamic Jihad members that operate under the shelter of the PA military responsibility", said Colonel Erez Weiner of the IDF.
SNT.14946.11895	"We arrested five wanted members, some of whom were involved in the bombing of the Stage nightclub in Tel-Aviv."
SNT.14946.11896	"The forces are also trying to locate the explosives lab that is behind yesterday's car-bomb in Shavey Shomron."
SNT.14946.11897	"Apart from a few minor incidents we did not meet any opposition from the Palestinian side", Colonel Weiner said.
SNT.14946.11898	The suicide bombings in Netanya and Shavey Shomron and the reoccupation of Tulkarem follow five months of relative calm in the Israel-PA relations.
SNT.103550.11899	Steve Sinnott, who was the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers has died aged 56 of a suspected heart attack.
SNT.103550.11900	Just days before his death his union voted for a 24 hr strike, to take place on the 24 April as part of a campaign over government attempts to impose real-terms pay "cuts".
SNT.103550.11901	The Prime Minister Gordon Brown commented on the Union leaders death, saying, "Steve Sinnott was inspirational in his devotion to teaching, not just for children in Britain, but around the world".

SNT.103550.11907	In his private life he was a keen supporter of Everton F.C..
SNT.103550.11908	He leaves a wife, Mary, a son, daughter and two grandchildren.
SNT.241536.11909	Police in Russia say they have identified the man behind the bombing of Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport on Monday, although they will not yet name him.
SNT.241536.11910	Police said the man who killed 35 was a twenty-year-old suicide bomber from the North Caucasus region.
SNT.241536.11911	An Investigative Committee statement delivered by spokesman Vladimir Markin said "We have established the identity of the terrorist suicide bomber who set off the explosive."
SNT.241536.11912	"He turned out to be a 20-year-old native from one of the North Caucasus republics," and "Despite the investigation having established the name of the terrorist, we will not name him today," because it may hamper ongoing efforts to detain people suspected of collaborating.
SNT.241536.11913	Markin added "I would especially like to note that it was by no means an accident that the act of terror was committed in the international arrivals hall…"
SNT.241536.11914	"According to investigators, the act of terror was first and foremost aimed against foreign citizens."
SNT.241536.11915	Eight of those killed were foreigners and several flights had just landed from European origins.
SNT.241536.11916	President Dmitry Medvedev sacked several transportations officials in the wake of the bombing.
SNT.241536.11917	The nation's transport infrastructure will deal with extra visitors when the country hosts the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 World Cup.
SNT.241536.11918	Medvedev has targeted both security officials and airport management in the wake of the bombing.
SNT.241536.11919	Few official details have been released by the investigation and unofficial reports in the press have been contradictory; one report suggested a suicide bomber wearing a plastic explosive-based shrapnel bomb belt.
SNT.241536.11920	Another said it could have been detonated remotely, while a third suggested a timer.
SNT.241536.11921	Russian newspapers initially suggested a bag had exploded on the floor, while local TV has shown CCTV footage of the explosion.
SNT.241536.11922	Unconfirmed reports also claim the Federal Security Service was searching for three people ahead of the attack and that the bomber was Vitaly Razdobudko of Stavropol.
SNT.241536.11923	Although nobody has claimed responsibility or been arrested for the airport attack, Markin told reporters several people have been brought in on suspicion of planning an attack on December 31, while others are being sought.
SNT.241536.11924	He linked them to an explosion on the 31st in a Moscow hotel, in which a bomber died after the device he was building went off prematurely.
SNT.241536.11925	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the attack is not thought to be linked to Chechnyan insurgency.
SNT.241536.11926	The attack is Moscow's second within a year, with two women from Dagestan, North Caucuses blowing themselves up on the Metro and killing 39 in 2010.
SNT.114594.11927	The Icelandic internet bank, Icesave, has suspended all 300,000 of its UK customer accounts, leaving account holders in the United Kingdom unable to withdraw or deposit any funds.
SNT.114594.11928	"We are not currently processing any deposits or any withdrawal requests through our Icesave internet accounts."
SNT.114594.11929	"We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers."
SNT.114594.11930	The internet bank, owned by the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki (Landsbankinn), which was recently nationalised in an attempt to rescue it, has been hit by the global financial crisis.
SNT.114594.11931	Reports from the United Kingdom suggest that the traders and city are preparing for the parent company to be declared insolvent, leaving customers to recover their monies through a financial compensation scheme being backed by the Icelandic Government.
SNT.114594.11932	The plan will cover the first € 20,887 (Approx £16,300 / $28,720), the remainder of the customers funds being recovered through the UK's own financial compensation system.
SNT.114594.11933	Following the decision to nationalise Landsbanki, the Icelandic Prime Minister, Geir Haarde, who introduced and signed the emergency legislation into law, stated:"What we are doing here is saving a banking system - saving the domestic banking system - and making sure that it can function properly."
SNT.114594.11934	In describing and explaining its actions in nationalising the bank, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority issued this brief statement:
SNT.114594.11935	In response to the deepening world financial situation, the Dutch government has this afternoon increased its savers protection from €38,000 to €80,000 effective immediately, to help secure the financial status of its savers within Holland.
SNT.114594.11936	Icesave also has a Dutch branch, icesave.nl - their website was unreachable at the time of this article.

SNT.56608.11938	Xtra, owned by New Zealand telecommunication monopoly company Telecom, has created a joint venture between themselves and Yahoo!7, creating Yahoo Xtra.
SNT.56608.11939	Yahoo!7 is the joint venture between Yahoo! and Australian network, Seven.
SNT.56608.11940	The joint venture replaces the current and long-lasting partnership between Microsoft and Xtra, called XtraMSN.
SNT.56608.11941	The current partnership's contract will expire at the end of this year.
SNT.56608.11942	Telecom chose to change the partnership because Yahoo! has worked together with BT Group, Verizon and Rogers Communications.
SNT.56608.11943	The new site, along with new online content will go online on around March 1, 2007.
SNT.56608.11944	The partnership will result in Yahoo!7 taking 51% control of the partnership and Xtra taking the remaining 49%.
SNT.56608.11945	Kevin Kenrick, chief operating officer of Telecom, said that they will now be able to target the underdeveloped online advertising community.
SNT.56608.11946	"We see there is a fantastic opportunity to grow online advertising and the share of the online market."
SNT.56608.11947	"Online advertising in New Zealand is getting to a tipping point of growth where there is a critical mass of online connections, broadband connections and an increase in the amount of time people are spending online."
SNT.56608.11948	When the new site is launched, it will include a range of news, sport, weather, enhanced e-mail spam and virus protection, photo sharing, and internet radio.
SNT.56608.11949	Theresa Gattung, chief executive of Telecom, said: "The Yahoo Xtra joint venture will provide New Zealanders with access to the world's best online services in a localised way."
SNT.56608.11950	Ian Smith, chief executive of Yahoo!7, said: "The company was achieving market growth of online advertising of between 50 and 60 per cent a year in Australia and believed it could do the same in New Zealand."
SNT.56608.11951	He said that the partnership will give them a great opportunity to showcase its tools, technology and platforms in New Zealand.
SNT.56608.11952	Mr Kenrick said that the reason they had gotten a partnership with Yahoo!7 was that it is very difficult for a small player to develop its services in a New Zealand size market.
SNT.56608.11953	One other online company Xtra had considered for the partnership was Google, among others.
SNT.56608.11954	The reason they chose Yahoo!7 over other companies was because Yahoo!7 has the top position in big fields such as TV and video.
SNT.56608.11955	Mr Kenrick said: "The whole area of content management is one we thought would benefit from others with greater expertise and more scope."
SNT.14338.11956	The University of Alberta is set to expand into the heart of Edmonton's downtown with plans now in place to purchase the aging Hudson's Bay building on Jasper Avenue between 102nd Street and 103rd Street.
SNT.14338.11957	The deal, which is yet to be approved by the University's Board of Governors, could result in students starting classes in the building as early as September 2006.
SNT.14338.11958	The building has been a huge vacancy in the downtown core, with only the broadcasting corporation CHUM Limited using any space.
SNT.14338.11959	University of Alberta President Indira Samarasekera has said there are no plans to ask the company, which owns 91.7 The Bounce and A-Channel to move.
SNT.14338.11960	The total University population is growing much faster than the number of facilities required to support it, so expanding beyond the current campus makes sense.
SNT.14338.11961	Establishing a presence downtown will also help the University and its many spin off companies.
SNT.14338.11962	The University has not yet decided how the project would be funded, but is currently looking at a number of options, including partnerships with all three levels of government.
SNT.61561.11963	Protests have continued after Manchester United defeated Lille in the Champions League round of 16.
SNT.61561.11964	A free kick by Ryan Giggs in the second half of the game caused great controversy, as Lille was setting up their wall as the ball went into the back of the net.
SNT.61561.11965	Lille players nearly walked off the pitch at the time, but they were goaded back onto the field, and the game ended 1 - 0 for Manchester United.
SNT.61561.11966	Lille made one protest to UEFA, asking for a replay of the match, but the appeal was turned down, and the decision of referee Eric Braamhaar stood for the time.
SNT.61561.11967	Lille has made a second protest, claiming a technical error on the referee's part, as the kick was taken without the whistle being blown.
SNT.61561.11968	UEFA has rejected their appeal again, saying no proof of a technical error has been presented.
SNT.61561.11969	Lille will have 3 days after receiving notice from UEFA to lodge another appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, or the claim will be dismissed in full.
SNT.61561.11970	The second leg game between United and Lille will take place next Wednesday at Old Trafford.
SNT.48069.11971	South Auckland Tyndale Park Christian School have been asking parents of the pupils for permission to administer corporal punishment.
SNT.48069.11972	The parents are informed that corporal punishment is illegal in New Zealand schools but it quotes the Bible "we ought to serve God rather than men".
SNT.48069.11973	Today the New Zealand Herald reported that they had obtained documents that outline the school's "corporal correction" policy.
SNT.48069.11974	The policy states that the strap must be given on the hand after consultation with another staff member and while that staff member is present.
SNT.48069.11975	The child will then either be spoken to, prayed with or both.
SNT.48069.11976	Bradford said: "A full investigation was needed to ascertain whether any students at the school had been assaulted."
SNT.48069.11977	Tyndale Park Christian School is a private Christian school that caters for students ranging from Year 1 to Year 13.
SNT.48069.11978	Jan Brinkham, school manager, said: "Our enrollment policy is between the parents who enroll children here and ourselves."
SNT.48069.11979	"We are not a state school; we are not bound by a particular enrollment policy."
SNT.48069.11980	"This is between the parents that enrol their children at our school and that is where the buck stops."
SNT.48069.11981	"It's got nothing to do with anyone else except our parents," he added.
SNT.48069.11982	The Education Review Office (ERO) and the Ministry of Education said that they were unaware of the policy and that private schools are not legally obliged to produce documents to government bodies.
SNT.48069.11983	ERO last year said in a report: "The school manager should ensure that parents are clearly informed that the school administers no corporal punishment."
SNT.48069.11984	Charlene Scotti, ERO area manger of review services said: "Some schools had policies to call parents in for cases where corporal punishment was required, but were careful not to include staff in punishing students."
SNT.48069.11985	Bruce Adin, Ministry of Education northern regional manager, said: "The legality of the Tyndale Park document was unclear, but if school staff strapped a student it would be illegal."
SNT.48069.11986	"Corporal punishment in schools was made illegal years ago because it was considered to be brutal and unnecessary," Bradford said.
SNT.117717.11987	Another member of the Pennsylvania State University's cheerleading squad will step in to play the Nittany Lion at the 2009 Rose Bowl, after the main performer was suspended after being charged with DUI and summary traffic violations late last month.
SNT.117717.11988	Penn State is the largest university in Pennsylvania and among the ten largest public universities in the United States.
SNT.117717.11989	Pennsylvanian James Sheep was charged with driving under the influence on November 22.
SNT.117717.11990	Cheerleading coach Curt White told the Associated Press that Sheep will return later in 2009.
SNT.117717.11991	Sheep was pulled over on campus at 3:16 am November 22, before Penn's game versus Michigan State.
SNT.117717.11992	Sheep has avoided interview requests by The Daily Collegian, Penn State's newspaper, on multiple occasions.
SNT.117717.11993	In a statement, White commented: "James has been a very enthusiastic and hard-working Nittany Lion, but we are disappointed that his recent actions did not represent the high standards of this position."
SNT.117717.11994	"We are planning to have James resume his duties in the new year and are confident that he will represent Penn State Athletics and the University with a high level of energy, dedication and respect."
SNT.117717.11995	The Pennsylvania State University website lists Sheep on their website as the Lion from 2007-2008, conflicting with coach White's comment that he would return in the new year.
SNT.117717.11996	The mascot was introduced in 1907, brought in as a costume character in 1921, and is even the subject of the book The Nittany Lion: An Illustrated Tale.
SNT.117717.11997	While most American university mascots change in appearance over the decades, the Nittany Lion remains essentially the same design as it has for generations.
SNT.117717.11998	Some earlier reports suggested that "46 current or former Penn State [football] players have been charged with crimes on 163 counts in the past six seasons."
SNT.117717.11999	Of those players charged, 27 were found guilty of at least one charge.
SNT.3671.12000	On January 25, 2005, Don Brash, the leader of the New Zealand National Party made a speech to the Orewa Rotary Club where he focussed upon welfare dependency.
SNT.3671.12001	He pledged to reduce the number of working-age beneficiaries from the current figure of 300 000 to 200 000 over ten years.
SNT.3671.12002	His particular target was the 109 000 solo parents on the Domestic Purposes Benefit (DPB).
SNT.3671.12003	Brash suggested a greater role for adoption in reducing this number, and also hinted that mothers who did not name the father, or who had another child while already on the DPB, may be penalised.
SNT.3671.12004	Brash's advocacy of adopting children out has lead to a number of attacks, Prime Minister Helen Clark responded by saying "I think we need to support people to keep their babies".
SNT.35155.12005	The judge in the U.S. federal death penalty trial against Zacarias Moussaoui ruled on Friday that prosecutors can seek replacement witnesses for seven Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees whose testimony was tainted, and therefore disallowed because of pre-trial coaching by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) lawyer.
SNT.35155.12006	The 18-member jury (6 alternates) were sent home for a week while the court dealt with the revelation that government aviation security witness had been contacted prior to the trial by TSA lawyer Carla J. Martin, to help prepare their testimony in the case.
SNT.35155.12007	Martin, aged 51, is accused of misconduct by sending prosecution witnesses e-mail that included trial transcripts of another related case along with observations of her own that pertained to the Moussaoui case, including suggestions and talking points.
SNT.35155.12008	She was recently suspended with pay by the TSA and retained Roscoe Howard to act as legal counsel in the face of legal actions that might arise against her.
SNT.35155.12009	Judge Leonie M. Brinkema initially ruled to prevent testimony from any aviation employees, but reversed her decision after the prosecution argued they would have little case left if their testimony remained inadmissible.
SNT.35155.12010	FAA employee testimony is expected to take the form of what measures would have been taken by the agency to prevent against the September 11, 2001 airliner attacks in New York City and Washington D.C. if Moussaoui had warned officials of the plan prior to the strikes.
SNT.35155.12011	The connection to the Carla Martin involvement in the case was discovered in a separate trial involving liability lawsuits against two U.S. airline companies for losses as a result of the attacks.
SNT.35155.12012	Family member lawyers of flight attendants drew attention to contacts by Martin to persons involved in the case.
SNT.35155.12013	A U.S. federal public defender appointed to Moussaoui argued for the jury to spare his life during opening statements on Monday, March 6, in the trial that will determine his fate — either life in prison or death by lethal injection.
SNT.35155.12014	Defense attorney Edward B. MacMahon said that Moussaoui "aspires to martyrdom," and called on jurors to deny the Al-Qaeda operative his wish to die.
SNT.35155.12015	A wish that would result in him becoming "a smiling face on a recruiting poster for Osama bin Laden," MacMahon said.
SNT.35155.12016	Moussaoui is believed by some to be the missing member in the team of 19 other attackers that carried out the suicide airliner strikes in New York City and Washington D.C.
SNT.35155.12017	Arrested in Minnesota on immigration charges three weeks prior to the attacks, Moussaoui could have warned officials of the pending attacks, but failed to do so, argued Assistant U.S. Attorney Rob Spencer for the prosecution in opening statements.
SNT.35155.12018	He said that he was to play a role in another future attack on the White House using an aircraft.
SNT.35155.12019	Four of the conspiracy charges each carry a maximum penalty of death.
SNT.35155.12020	Family members of the nearly 3,000 killed in the attacks were able to watch the Alexandria, Virginia courtroom proceedings by closed-circuit television in six U.S. cities: New York, Boston, Central Islip, N.Y., Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia.
SNT.35155.12021	Moussaoui has a history of disrupting previous trial proceedings with outbursts.
SNT.35155.12022	He has disavowed his lawyers, and mostly ignored his mother who was present during the opening days of the trial because she had spoken to his defense lawyers.
SNT.35155.12023	Upon leaving the Tuesday, March 7 court session for a recess, Moussaoui pumped his right fist in the air and shouted, "Allah Akbar! God curse America! Bless Osama bin Laden!"
SNT.35155.12024	The outbursts have been timed to occur outside the earshot of Judge Brinkema and the jury as those persons filed out of the courtroom for recesses.
SNT.35155.12025	Moussaoui pleaded guilty in April last year to the conspiracy charges.
SNT.35155.12026	Evidence linking him to the plot was discovered when his duffel bags were searched after the attacks.
SNT.2529.12027	The race name is a homage to Saint Silvester, a catholic saint who died in December 31, 335.
SNT.2529.12028	During his government the Christian religion became the official religion of the Roman Empire under the rule of Constantine the Great.
SNT.2529.12029	This event was important for the Christians because they have been persecuted by the Roman Empire during 300 years and now they would have freedom to profess their religion without been in risk of been arrested or convicted to death by the government.
SNT.2529.12030	For the 2004 race, the number of participants was about 15 thousand, with 13 thousand men and 2 thousand women.
SNT.2529.12031	The majority of athletes were from Brazil but others came from other countries including Argentina, Australia, Sweden, the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Chile, Finland, Portugal, Luxemburg, Bolivia, Canada, South Korea, France, England, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico and Uruguay.
SNT.2529.12032	The women's race started at 3 p.m.(local time) while the men's race started two hours later.
SNT.160269.12033	Apple sued HTC, a Taiwanese manufacturer of mobile phones, on Tuesday, in a lawsuit claiming 20 different patent infringements, largely relating to the user interface of the iPhone, which is manufactured by Apple.
SNT.160269.12034	According to the lawsuit, filed with both the United States District Court in Delaware and the United States International Trade Commission, HTC violated Apple patents pertaining to both multi-touch gestures, which allow users to interact with a device's touchscreen using multiple fingers, as well as patents involving more general touch features.
SNT.160269.12035	Devices mentioned in the suit are all phones manufactured by HTC that use Google's Android software.
SNT.160269.12036	The lawsuit says that HTC, in selling the phones, knowingly induced those using the mentioned products to violate patents owned by Apple, some of which were filed in the mid-1990s.
SNT.160269.12037	Although the lawsuit named only HTC as a defendant, many viewed the action as an indirect challenge to Google, as the lawsuit only covered HTC devices running Google's Android software.
SNT.160269.12038	The operating system has seen increasing popularity in the last year, and has increasingly included multi-touch input of the type mentioned in the lawsuit.
SNT.160269.12039	One analyst, from Kaufman Brothers, said, "I think this is kind of an indirect lawsuit against Google."
SNT.160269.12040	Others said that Apple was suing HTC instead of Google because the phone manufacturer was an easier target than Google.
SNT.160269.12041	Another analyst from MKM Partners said that "HTC is an optimal target for Apple-it's a relatively small vendor with a weak brand."
SNT.160269.12042	In the documents, Apple said that their goal was to permanently block HTC from importing and selling devices that had the offending qualities, as well a significant cash payment in damages.
SNT.77454.12043	Researchers say that new, ten million-year-old fossils found in Ethiopia, prove that the theory that humans may have evolved from a species of great apes eight million years ago, may not be true, but that humans may have split from apes as long as 10.5 million years ago.
SNT.77454.12044	At least nine fossilized teeth, one canine tooth and eight molars, of a previously unknown species of apes found in Africa were discovered by a team of researchers from Ethiopia and Japan who then compared the 3-D make up of the teeth to other fossils that date back as far as 8 million years and found that the fossils are likely a "direct ancestor" of apes currently living in Africa and that the new ape fossils were that of a species of gorilla who ate mostly plants high in fiber.
SNT.77454.12045	Current fossils and research say that the evolutionary split from apes to humans occurred at least eight million years ago.
SNT.77454.12046	The new fossils say that the split may have happened as long as 10.5 million years ago.
SNT.77454.12047	"Based on this fossil, that means the split is much earlier than has been anticipated by the molecular evidence."
SNT.77454.12048	"That means everything has to be put back," said researcher at the Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia and a co-author of the study, Berhane Asfaw.
SNT.77454.12049	Despite the finds, other researchers are not convinced that the findings are correct.
SNT.77454.12050	"It is stretching the evidence to base a time scale for the evolution of the great apes on this new fossil."
SNT.77454.12051	"These structures appear on at least three independent lineages of apes, including gorillas, and they could relate to a dietary shift rather than indicating a new genetic trait," said a Professor at the London Natural History Museum in the United Kingdom, Peter Andrews who also added, "but the fossil evidence for the evolution of our closest living relatives, the great apes, is almost non-existent.
SNT.77454.12052	Researchers have named the newly discovered species Cororapithecus abyssinicus whose remains were found in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, the same place where the remains of Lucy were discovered in 1974.
SNT.144555.12053	The Large Hadron Collider, a vast scientific experiment to smash together sub-atomic particles, moved a step closer to its goal on Friday night.
SNT.144555.12054	Physicists announced they had sent protons all the way round the 27 km ring beneath the France–Switzerland border, for the first time since a major failure 14 months ago.
SNT.144555.12055	The experiment, the largest of its kind in the world, was first switched on with great fanfare in September 2008, but suffered an electrical fault just nine days later.
SNT.144555.12056	This caused a leak of ultra-cold liquid helium, resulting in severe damage.
SNT.144555.12057	Repairs have cost approximately £24 million, on top of the £6 billion spent originally.
SNT.144555.12058	Particles were injected into the ring at around 1500 GMT on Friday, and just after 1930 GMT the first completed circuit was confirmed.
SNT.144555.12059	"We've still got some way to go before physics can begin, but with this milestone we're well on the way," stated Rolf Heuer, director-general of CERN, the European research group running the collider.
SNT.144555.12060	The Large Hadron Collider is designed to smash together particles at almost the speed of light, creating conditions similar to those only moments after the Big Bang.
SNT.144555.12061	By studying these collisions, scientists hope to shed light on theories such as supersymmetry and the Higgs boson.
SNT.144555.12062	The six physicists Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble, Higgs, Brout, and Englert who predicted this particle in 1964 were recently awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work.
SNT.144555.12063	Barring further problems, the first collisions are scheduled to take place in January next year.
SNT.62063.12064	The John Lewis Partnership retail group announced massively increased profits this morning, with group sales up 11% on the financial year to £6.4billion ($12.3billion) and pre-tax profits up 27% to £319million ($614.8 million).
SNT.62063.12065	On the back of this, it was announced that the amount of money set aside from profits for the employees of the business would rise 29% to £155million, with each employee receiving 18% of their previous year's salary as a lump sum as part of their March pay package.
SNT.62063.12066	The Partnership, as the name implies, is effectively wholly owned by its own employees (termed "partners"), with all partners receiving a share of the profits yearly as a bonus along with various other benefits.
SNT.62063.12067	The company owns the John Lewis chain of department stores and the upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose.
SNT.62063.12068	It should not be confused with the Liverpool store Lewis's which has recently gone into receivership.
SNT.50053.12069	An ATM in Virginia Beach, Virginia was cracked so it would give out 4 times as much money as it was supposed to; and this was done just by entering numbers into the keypad.
SNT.50053.12070	A man bought a pre-paid card and used it in the ATM.
SNT.50053.12071	The attack consisted of a magic number which was entered in the PIN keypad, which caused the machine to disburse $20 bills when it recorded giving out $5 dollar bills.
SNT.50053.12072	No one in authority noticed for nine days, until an honest ATM user reported the machine was giving out too much money.
SNT.702576.12073	A package of six media reform bills introduced last week before Australia's Parliament — including one proposing appointing a Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA) to monitor print and online sectors — was shelved yesterday by the Australian Labor Party, with only two passed before a seven week break for the country's legislative body.
SNT.702576.12074	Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, had hoped to see the legislation package passed by the end of the week.
SNT.702576.12075	The Parliament of Australia summarized Public Interest Media Advocate Bill 2013 as, "Part of a package of six bills in relation to the media sector, the bill: creates the independent statutory office of the Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA); provides for the functions, appointment, and terms and conditions of PIMA; and requires an annual report to be prepared on PIMA’s activities and other specified matters."
SNT.702576.12076	Other bills in the package delineate what PIMA's role would be.
SNT.702576.12077	Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Convergence Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013 and Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2013 both had their second reading on Tuesday in the House and were the only bills to pass both houses of parliament.
SNT.702576.12078	Unlike the other bills in the package which have not had a third reading before being shelved, the former bill deals primarily with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Special Broadcasting Service, while the latter bill increased licensing fees for television stations.
SNT.702576.12079	On Monday, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) released a statement saying such government oversight is not required.
SNT.702576.12080	Australia's The Daily Telegraph is quoted by the Brisbane Times describing this legislation as an "aggressive attempt to silence your media."
SNT.702576.12081	Speaking before a Senate committee about media reform, AAP chief Bruce Davidson said, "We simply do not believe that there is a problem with the conduct of the media in Australia, and certainly not that of AAP, that warrants further oversight by a minister-appointed body [...]"
SNT.702576.12082	"Any hidden perception, I believe, of government interference is simply a dangerous precedent that may lead to control, may lead to interference [...]"
SNT.702576.12083	"The aims may be noble, Mr Chairman, but the potential for potential misuse and changes of that legislation as presented to us, I think, is a dangerous thing to contemplate."
SNT.702576.12084	Former federal court judge Ray Finkelstein oversaw an inquiry into the Australian print media in 2011.
SNT.702576.12085	He told a government inquiry, "There are no powerful groups in society that can come along to governments or anybody and say 'we can do what we like when we like and there's nothing you should do about it'."
SNT.702576.12086	Finkelstein is also on the record as stating that self regulation by the industry through their own organization has failed.
SNT.8628.12087	Rock group U2 will play a third date at Dublin's Croke Park this year.
SNT.8628.12088	Following strong demand from fans, the group have announced that they will play Monday June 27th in addition to the 23rd and 24th.
SNT.8628.12089	The band's current Vertigo tour has proved extremely popular among fans, with the original 160,000 Dublin tickets sold in less than an hour.
SNT.8628.12090	The tour officially kicked off in San Diego, USA on 28 March 2005.
SNT.8628.12091	Although no support act has yet been lined up for the extra date, it is widely believed that promoters MCD will have no trouble selling the additional 80,000 tickets.
SNT.12273.12092	Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen signed a bill Wednesday authorizing the state's new budget of nearly $26 billion.
SNT.12273.12093	The new budget increases spending for education and fulfills Bredesen's commitment to decrease TennCare spending.
SNT.12273.12094	The new budget also includes an increase in spending for the state's preschool program, as much as $100 million in funding for TennCare disenrollees, and a significant contribution to the state's reserve fund.
SNT.12273.12095	Bredesen also signed into law a bill authorizing the General Assembly to begin drafting new ethics laws.
SNT.10292.12096	Peter Milliken, Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, broke the tie on the vote on the second reading of the Canadian budget amendment, C-48, by voting in favour of the government, most likely averting a spring election, CBC Newsworld reported.
SNT.10292.12097	The amendment to the budget adds $4.6 billion in social spending and delays of tax cuts.
SNT.10292.12098	The outcome of the second reading vote on the main budget bill, C-43, was less dramatic as Conservative Leader Stephen Harper said that his party would support it.
SNT.10292.12099	The vote for the amendment was tied at 152-152 until the Speaker's intervention, who only votes in the case of the tie.
SNT.10292.12100	He stated his vote for the bill was in order to continue Parliamentary debate leading up to a third reading.
SNT.10292.12101	It is the first time in post-Confederation Canada that the Speaker has had to break a tie on a non-confidence motion.
SNT.10292.12102	The budget and the budget amendment were confidence motions, meaning that the government would have fallen and an election would have been called if either one failed.
SNT.10292.12103	During the vote, Wikinews reporter Andrew pmk noted that the website of CBC, a major Canadian television network, was unavailable.
SNT.217919.12104	Space Shuttle Discovery's final launch on the STS-133 mission to the International Space Station has been delayed at least an additional day.
SNT.217919.12105	Launch is now targeted for 3:29 PM EDT on Thursday.
SNT.217919.12106	The launch was originally scheduled for this past Monday, but was delayed two days because of helium and nitrogen leaks on board the shuttle.
SNT.217919.12107	Technicians are now working to repair technical glitches discovered yesterday on a main engine control computer.
SNT.217919.12108	The weather outlook, however, appears to be unfavorable for the new targeted launch day; there is an 80 percent chance of undesirable weather, according to the NASA space shuttle weather officer Kathy Winters.
SNT.217919.12109	The mission management team (MMT) is meeting today to discuss and troubleshoot Discovery's newfound electrical problems.
SNT.217919.12110	STS-133 is scheduled to be an 11-day mission to the International Space Station to ship supplies to the crew, as well as additional components for the orbital outpost's construction, including the Permanent Multipurpose Module and the third of four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers.
SNT.217919.12111	The mission is the 133rd of the Space Shuttle Program and the 39th of Discovery.
SNT.362699.12112	A judge in Germany has ordered a man from Kosovo to be jailed for life for carrying out the "first Islamic-motivated terror attack" within the country.
SNT.362699.12113	Arid Uka, 22, killed two US (USAF) men and wounded two more in a gun attack on their bus in Frankfurt.
SNT.362699.12114	Uka, a Kosovan who has lived in Germany since he was four, worked in Frankfurt Airport's mail room.
SNT.362699.12115	He became attracted to Islamic radicalism in a matter of months and would later cite a video appearing to show US soldiers raping women in Afghanistan as his motive for the attack.
SNT.362699.12116	Uka approached a USAF bus at the airport, asking a serviceman for a cigarette.
SNT.362699.12117	Upon learning the group was bound for Afghanistan he fatally shot the man in the head before boarding the bus with a cry of (God is Great).
SNT.362699.12118	There, he opened fire upon more USAF airmen, killing a second and injuring two others.
SNT.362699.12119	The remaining eleven passengers escaped injury when his 9mm pistol jammed.
SNT.362699.12120	The team had been loading their bus in front of the airport during a trip that began in the United Kingdom.
SNT.362699.12121	The fatalities were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21.
SNT.362699.12122	Edgar Veguilla received arm and jaw wounds while Kristoffer Schneider was left requiring reconstructive surgery for his face.
SNT.362699.12123	Uka's weapon failed whilst pointed at a fifth man's head.
SNT.362699.12124	Schneider has ongoing pain, blindness in one eye, a missing section of skull and a face rebuilt from titanium.
SNT.362699.12125	Schneider testified via videolink from a USAF base in his homeland.
SNT.362699.12126	Prosecution evidence included songs and text from Uka's computer, phone, and music player.
SNT.362699.12127	He was said to have radicalised alone through access to material such as the fake rape film, which was actually a scene from the anti-war movie .
SNT.362699.12128	In sentencing Uka for murder Judge Thomas Sagebiel agreed with prosecutors there were aggravating circumstances that amounted to "particularly severe guilt," a move likely to prevent parole after fifteen years as is normally possible with German life sentences.
SNT.362699.12129	The judge said the attack was aggravated by its ambush nature, that unarmed men were attacked and Alden was also attacked from behind, and that the wounds inflicted were serious.
SNT.362699.12130	Sagebiel also noted Uka's refusal to explain how he acquired the gun.
SNT.362699.12131	There was no drug or alcohol use involved, and no evidence Uka had been trained for the attack.
SNT.362699.12132	The killer described himself to the court as spending much of his time on computers, with few friends and a largely non-religious family background.
SNT.362699.12133	He sat motionless with his eyes down and arms folded during the 70-minute verdict and sentencing hearing.
SNT.362699.12134	Uka had not joined any radical organisations and the defence claimed he was not a terrorist.
SNT.362699.12135	Last year he blamed inaccurate propaganda for having influenced him and apologised, claiming not to understand his own actions.
SNT.362699.12136	His defence lawyer, Michaela Roth, also sought to have his youth, admissions, and a troubled childhood considered.
SNT.362699.12137	Roth had suggested sexual abuse when Uka was six had led to a return of trauma when he saw the falsified rape video.
SNT.362699.12138	This was undermined by psychiatric expert opinion, a report finding the abuse — and the video — of no "decisive relevance".
SNT.362699.12139	He was aware when he killed, and did not have a personality disorder although he was of "an immature personality," it concluded.
SNT.362699.12140	"The attack was not only cowardly and perfidious, but also damaged Germany's reputation," said Sagebiel, telling victims and their relatives he "hoped that by our bringing the perpetrator to justice swiftly, you can find some comfort... and will not harbour any rancour towards Germany."
SNT.362699.12141	Alden's brother Joe was in court and later said "justice has been served."
SNT.19964.12142	News agency AAP reported last Thursday that George H. W. Bush would be attending the Forbes Global CEO Conference, which starts this Tuesday.
SNT.19964.12143	These reports have now been revealed to be a hoax.
SNT.19964.12144	They were based on a media release and associated website, and reported in Wikinews, as well as a number of print publications in Australia.
SNT.19964.12145	The president and publisher of Forbes Asia, William Adamopoulos, has confirmed that Mr Bush will not be attending.
SNT.19964.12146	"Mr Bush, Sr. is definitely not attending the conference," he said.
SNT.19964.12147	Mr Adamopoulos said that he is considering pursuing legal action against the originators of the hoax.
SNT.19964.12148	According to reports, the media release and website used the Forbes name.
SNT.19964.12149	"While we would not wish to oppose free speech in any way - for free speech is one of the things that unites both Australia and the United States - we are investigating what legal action could be open to us," he said.
SNT.19964.12150	Two Australian broadsheets fell for the hoax put out by the 30A protest network.
SNT.19964.12151	The network sent out a press release purporting to be from the organisers of the Annual Forbes Conference, claiming that former US President George H. W. Bush was to attend the conference.
SNT.19964.12152	Bruce Knobloch of the 30A network indicated that the purpose of the hoax was to show how shallow the media coverage of the conference and the protest is.
SNT.19964.12153	The hoax was originally reported by AAP, who checked the claim with a telephone number provided on the press release before publishing it.
SNT.19964.12154	The hoax was then picked up by several internet news sites, including this one.
SNT.19964.12155	AAP quickly published a retraction, however that didn't stop the hoax making its way into the paper versions of two of Australia's most respected broadsheets, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Australian.
SNT.19964.12156	The Forbes conference will take place at the Sydney Opera House, and will be attended by hundreds of CEOs from around the world, as well as Australian Prime Minister John Howard, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and Steve Forbes himself.
SNT.19964.12157	There is a protest planned to coincide with the conference.
SNT.19964.12158	Protest organisers have called for people to assemble at Customs Square at Circular Quay at 5pm on Tuesday 30 August.
SNT.19964.12159	The protest was originally planned for the Opera House forecourt, however police have declared this area to be an exclusion zone.
SNT.251694.12160	A man has been charged with the murder of a 64-year old British woman in Hong Kong.
SNT.251694.12161	Janet Gilson's body was found dead in a flat on Lamma Island on Saturday.
SNT.251694.12162	She had been in Hong Kong since March 6th and was staying with her niece.
SNT.251694.12163	It is believed the man who has been charged with her murder was the estranged husband of her niece.
SNT.251694.12164	Police in Hong Kong would not confirm the identity of the suspect but have said that he was an "expatriate".
SNT.251694.12165	Gilson's niece Julia Fareed told the South China Morning Post that the man police are questioning is her estranged husband who is originally from the Maldives.
SNT.251694.12166	An official cause of death has not been released but it has been reported that Gilson did receive head injuries.
SNT.251694.12167	Regional director for the Salvation Army Major Carol Bailey paid tribute to Gilson, saying, "She was a deeply spiritual woman and was highly respected and loved by all those with whom she came into contact."
SNT.37643.12168	The world's second largest auto parts maker, Delphi Corporation, has announced today that 8,500 salary workers may be out of a job soon as part of a major restructuring plan, which will also include voiding the contract with the UAW union.
SNT.37643.12169	The move would also shutdown over a third of its factories worldwide, including twenty one located in the United States.
SNT.37643.12170	Eight plants in the U.S. are slated to continue operating.
SNT.37643.12171	Those located in Clinton, Mississippi, Brookhaven, Mississippi, Lockport, New York, Rochester, New York, Warren, Ohio, Vandalia, Ohio, Kokomo, Indiana, and Grand Rapids, Michigan will continue to serve as Delphi properties.
SNT.37643.12172	The rest of the factories are said to either be sold to other companies, or to be closed entirely.
SNT.37643.12173	The plans were brought up to a bankruptcy judge earlier today.
SNT.37643.12174	In addition to the proposed closings and layoffs, 34,000 workers may experience cut wages and less benefits.
SNT.37643.12175	Hourly workers wages will drop from $27 to $22 an hour soon, and will further decrease to $16.50 in late 2007.
SNT.37643.12176	Delphi previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2005.
SNT.37643.12177	In the original filing, requests were made to drop the hourly wages down to $12.50 an hour.
SNT.108662.12178	As the National Disaster Coordinating Agency continues to evaluate the reports coming from regions all over the Philippines, bodies of those who drowned or perished while at sea have started to float into the shores of islands in Central Philippines.
SNT.108662.12179	On Thursday, the Philippines Coast Guard reported that villagers recovered 124 bodies whose identities are still uncertain.
SNT.108662.12180	Advanced decomposition has made identification difficult for authorities and, fearing a health epidemic, all of the bodies were immediately buried in makeshift graves.
SNT.108662.12181	The identification of the victims has caused a stir among relatives looking for their missing family members, as forensic investigators were rendered helpless in proceeding to the scattered locations where bodies have been washing ashore.
SNT.108662.12182	Over 100 divers from the combined Philippines and United States naval forces have been working overtime to retrieve the bodies of passengers trapped inside the capsized MV Princess of the Stars.
SNT.108662.12183	Disaster management officials in the country announced that the dead from the weekend battering from Typhoon Fengshen could reach to a high of 1,300 people nation-wide.
SNT.108662.12184	State officials reported that some 2.4 million Filipinos were affected by the disaster, putting property damage at a conservative estimate of $125 million.
SNT.108662.12185	Relatives of missing passengers were finally brought near the site where the ferry capsized.
SNT.108662.12186	On board a tug boat, relatives became severely emotional after a Roman Catholic mass was celebrated to commemorate the memory of those lost at sea.
SNT.128287.12187	The number of hungry people in the world is projected to reach an all-time high of 1.02 billion this year, according to a report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
SNT.128287.12188	The report blames this latest spike in world hunger chiefly on the global economic recession, which has increased unemployment and reduced incomes among the poor, leading to greater food insecurity.
SNT.128287.12189	The report, published on Friday, estimates that over 1 billion people will go hungry each day in 2009, a first in human history.
SNT.128287.12190	This is a significant increase over last year's estimate of 915 million hungry people.
SNT.128287.12191	According to the FAO, this increase of around 100 million people is not a result of poor harvests, as in the past, but rather a poor economy.
SNT.128287.12192	"A dangerous mix of the global economic slowdown combined with stubbornly high food prices in many countries has pushed some 100 million more people than last year into chronic hunger and poverty," said Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the FAO.
SNT.128287.12193	"The silent hunger crisis — affecting one sixth of all of humanity — poses a serious risk for world peace and security."
SNT.128287.12194	Although food prices have declined from their record high levels in mid-2008, the report states that global food prices are still high compared to previous years, and that domestic prices remain prohibitively high in developing countries.
SNT.128287.12195	In Mauritania, for example, a staple food such as wheat still costs over 600 USD per tonne, whereas in the United States the price has fallen below 300 USD.
SNT.128287.12196	The current economic situation has intensified the problem created by high food prices.
SNT.128287.12197	Many sources of income for developing countries, including remittances, foreign direct investment, foreign aid, and international trade, are expected to undergo severe declines.
SNT.128287.12198	In addition, because of the global nature of the economic crisis, previously-used mechanisms such as currency depreciation and borrowing from international credit markets are more limited in their scope, according to the FAO.
SNT.128287.12199	In developing countries, the report says, the urban poor are likely to be most affected by the economic slowdown, as their ability to find work is most dependent on factors like foreign investment and export demand.
SNT.128287.12200	However, rural areas could also be affected, as an urban back-migration to the farms would put more pressure on an already strained rural job market.
SNT.128287.12201	Budget constraints would lead families to purchase more grain products, which are cheaper than meat, dairy products, and other foods rich in protein.
SNT.128287.12202	Investment in agriculture, according to Director-General Diouf, is the key to overcoming poverty and hunger in poorer countries.
SNT.128287.12203	These countries "must be given the development, economic and policy tools required to boost their agricultural production and productivity", he said.
SNT.128287.12204	Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, says that investment in agriculture is not only essential for overcoming hunger, but also for promoting economic growth in developing countries.
SNT.128287.12205	"To unleash this potential and reduce the number of hungry people in the world," he said, the international community must ensure that farmers "have access not only to seeds and fertilisers but to tailored technologies, infrastructure, rural finance, and markets."
SNT.128287.12206	However, the economic slowdown has forced the UN’s World Food Programme to shut down some of its operations, as it receives less financial aid from donor countries.
SNT.128287.12207	Out of a required yearly budget of 6.4 billion USD, the agency currently has less than one-fourth of that amount.
SNT.128335.12208	An American football coach has been shot at his school gym in Iowa, United States.
SNT.128335.12209	Ed Thomas was shot in front of his students at around 8.00 am local time.
SNT.128335.12210	Thomas was in the weight room at the time of the shooting.
SNT.128335.12211	An adult male has been arrested suspected of his murder.
SNT.128335.12212	Thomas was the head football coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School.
SNT.128335.12213	He had coached 37 seasons of High School football in his career and has a career record of 292-84 of which 156-31 is with Aplington-Parkersburg.
SNT.128335.12214	He led Parkersburg to 19 state playoffs and won state titles in 1993 and 2001.
SNT.128335.12215	He was named NFL High School Coach of the Year in 2003 and previously coached four active NFL players including Brad Meester, Jared DeVries, Casey Wiegmann and Aaron Kampman.
SNT.128335.12216	Thomas was well known in the local community for his work.
SNT.128335.12217	When Parkersburg was hit by a tornado in the summer of 2008 Thomas worked endlessly to restore the damaged football field.
SNT.128335.12218	County Sheriff Jason Johnson said that "Coach Thomas is the pillar of the community.
SNT.111913.12219	A former Christian Pastor Michael Guglielmucci has admitted that his cancer is a hoax.
SNT.111913.12220	Wikinews has also learned that one of the churches he preached at has had videos showing his claims of cancer removed from YouTube, claiming copyright infringement.
SNT.111913.12221	He has also admitted to being addicted to pornography for over 16 years.
SNT.111913.12222	For at least two years, Gugliemucci claimed to have leukaemia.
SNT.111913.12223	Reports say that he received an unknown amount of money through donations for his treatments and even released an compact disc album single titled 'Healer'.
SNT.111913.12224	YouTube began removing the videos after the Hillsong Church in Sydney, one of the churches Gugliemucci preached at, began to claim they were in violation of copyright laws.
SNT.111913.12225	Those videos reportedly had shown Gugliemucci speaking about his cancer and also included a video from his hit single album Healer.
SNT.111913.12226	Some videos even showed him wearing an oxygen mask while he was performing his sermon.
SNT.111913.12227	According to reports, several attempts to re-upload his videos to YouTube was quickly met with the site removing the videos under claims that they violate copyright laws.
SNT.111913.12228	Wikinews has contacted the church, its publishing company, and YouTube for a statement regarding the removal of the videos, but has yet to receive a response.
SNT.111913.12229	After the announcement of Gugliemucci's hoax, his father Danny released a statement saying that his son will undergo professional treatment for his "sins."
SNT.111913.12230	"Michael is struggling with a different kind of illness and is receiving professional help and will do so as long as is needed.
SNT.111913.12231	On the counsel and advice of our executive and board, after our up and coming Edge conference, we will take time to be with Mike and get him all the professional and spiritual help he needs to come to full recovery," said Danny Gugliemucci in a statement to the press.
SNT.111913.12232	"In September in 2006, Mike had an accident and went to hospital.
SNT.111913.12233	It was at this time, because of his torment of living a double life, Mike thought he could escape the pain by creating a diversion from his addiction to adult pornography, so he created the cancer scenario," added Danny.
SNT.130853.12234	The Government of the United Kingdom has assumed direct rule over the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean, after an enquiry discovered what it alleges to be corruption and "serious dishonesty" at the highest levels.
SNT.130853.12235	The islands' administration and Premier have been suspended for up to two years and their powers transferred to the UK-appointed Governor.
SNT.130853.12236	The British Government has taken the unusual step because it alleges that former Premier Michael Misick and members of his cabinet have enriched themselves through the selling of crown land and other corrupt practices, and that the limits to suffrage in the islands make it impossible to form a jury immune to the influence of the accused.
SNT.130853.12237	"This is a serious constitutional step which the UK government has not taken lightly, but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management", said the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Chris Bryant.
SNT.130853.12238	However the reaction by the local government have been hostile, with the action being described as a "coup" by deposed Premier Galmo Williams.
SNT.130853.12239	He told the BBC, "A coup is anything that has been done without the will of the people and being a colony anything the British government wants to do to us they can do to us."
SNT.130853.12240	The Turks and Caicos Islands have been British overseas territories since 1799, and since achieving self-governance in 1976 have significantly developed offshore banking and tourism industries.
SNT.251538.12241	Voters in Haiti are going to the polls today to vote for the country's next president.
SNT.251538.12242	The election follows months of political turmoil after the corrupt first round election in November caused a crisis requiring international intervention.
SNT.251538.12243	Haiti is still struggling to recover from the devastating January 2010 earthquake, with about one million people remaining in squalid, temporary shelters and a recent cholera epidemic which threatens to break out again with the return of the rainy season.
SNT.251538.12244	Observers are hoping the new president will restore enough stability so rebuilding efforts can begin with international help.
SNT.251538.12245	In Haiti’s first round of balloting in November, names were missing from voter rolls, ballot boxes were stuffed or trashed, voters were blocked from the precincts by supporters of candidates, among other irregularities.
SNT.251538.12246	Haitians rioted, plunging the process into chaos that was quelled by the determined efforts of foreign monitors.
SNT.251538.12247	Out of the original 19 candidates, two remained after the first round: Mirlande Manigat, age 70, a sedate, reserved university professor and wife of former president Leslie Manigat, and pop star "Sweet Micky" Martelly, age 50, who the The Washington Post described as being "a popular kompa singer [...] famous for dropping his pants on stage, mooning audiences, and dressing in drag — or sometimes a diaper."
SNT.251538.12248	However, Martelly has waged an energetic, well financed campaign with pink campaign posters picturing his smiling face and bald head, cultivating a populist image with Haiti’s poor.
SNT.251538.12249	He has been successful at marketing himself as an unpretentious outsider who will shake up the political system and yank the country out of its paralysis.
SNT.251538.12250	At the same time, he has courted the upper class with a platform containing pro-business promises and support for the return of the Haitian army.
SNT.251538.12251	The sedate personality of Manigat contrasts starkly with that of Martelly.
SNT.251538.12252	She portrays herself as a dignified, mature mother figure able to nurture Haiti through its troubles.
SNT.251538.12253	The determining factor may be the popular former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who returned two days ago to Haiti from South America after seven years in exile.
SNT.251538.12254	Aristide has not endorsed either candidate, but Aristide supporters, among those Haitians most desperately poor, have voiced support for Manigat.
SNT.251538.12255	Upon Aristide's arrival, there were banners saying, "My mother is here already.
SNT.251538.12256	Pierre-Marie Boisson, a private-sector economist in Haiti, sees the candidates as having similar platforms, promising jobs, housing and free education, even if their personal styles are so different.
SNT.251538.12257	"They have both promised the moon to the voters," he said.
SNT.251538.12258	He noted that this puts tremendous pressure on the winner to produce results quickly in a world where the price of food and fuel is rising.
SNT.251538.12259	As voting concluded, despite some irregularities such as missing ballots and late starts, authorities concluded the voting went well, without the pervasive fraud that marked the November election.
SNT.251538.12260	Colin Granderson, head of Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, said the runoff election was a great improvement over the previous one.
SNT.47017.12261-1	WHP Holdings Corp., the parent company of White Hen Pantry, has been acquired by Tokyo based Seven & I Holdings Co. for $35 million from New York investment firm, Angelo, Gordon & Co. 
SNT.47017.12261-2	White Hen has previously declared bankruptcy.
SNT.47017.12262	Seven & I is the owner and operator of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.
SNT.47017.12263	This is the largest buyout for the 7-Eleven brand in two decades and signals a continuance of the expansion Seven & I has pursued in recent years.
SNT.47017.12264	"This acquisition is a strategic fit for 7-Eleven and enhances market presence in the Chicagoland area," said 7-Eleven Inc.
SNT.47017.12265	The addition of White Hen stores will allow the company to increase their presence in greater Boston (55 stores) and metropolitan Chicago (206 stores) bringing their North American store count to over 7,100.
SNT.80308.12266	The U.S. economy and its currency as an instrument of world trade has suffered a series of major setbacks in recent months.
SNT.80308.12267	Some analysts say that the Federal Reserve's September 18th dramatic rate cut to 4.75% from 5.25% may be a case of "too little, too late", or that it was excessive and dooms the dollar.
SNT.80308.12268	Today, Saudi officials declined to cut interest rates in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve for the first time in decades.
SNT.80308.12269	According to Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, International Business Editor for The Daily Telegraph, "it's a signal that the oil-rich Gulf kingdom is preparing to break the dollar currency peg in a move that risks setting off a stampede out of the dollar across the Middle East."
SNT.80308.12270	Hans Redeker, the Currency Chief at BNP Paribas, also stated today that Saudi Arabia's move to not adjust their own interest rates in sync with the Fed's cuts is a very dangerous situation for the US dollar.
SNT.80308.12271	Redeker points out that "Saudi Arabia has $800bn (£400bn) in their future generation fund, and the entire region has $3,500bn under management.
SNT.80308.12272	They face an inflationary threat and do not want to import an interest rate policy set for the recessionary conditions in the United States."
SNT.80308.12273	Saudi central bank officials said that "appropriate measures" would be taken to stop the large capital inflows into the country.
SNT.80308.12274	The Federal Reserve's half-point rate cut has already caused a plunge in the world dollar index to a fifteen-year low, reaching the weakest level ever against the Euro at just under $1.40.
SNT.80308.12275	The Fed hopes that by making it cheaper to borrow, people will start spending and investing more.
SNT.80308.12276	However, some analysts fear the cut will worsen inflation, making it harder to get personal loans, and further decrease confidence in the dollar around the world.
SNT.80308.12277	There are already signs that global investors have started rejecting U.S. Treasury securities, and recent U.S. government data on foreign holdings show a decline in purchases of US securities from $97bn to just $19bn in July.
SNT.80308.12278	In response to Ben Bernanke's statements today about a potential mortgage and housing market crisis, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer said, "If adjustable mortgage rates go up, people may not be able to afford their mortgage payments."
SNT.80308.12279	Former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan said earlier this week that housing prices may fall by "double digits" as the subprime crisis bites harder, prompting households to cut back sharply on spending.
SNT.80308.12280	Jim Rogers, the economic commentator and former partner of George Soros, stated, "If Ben Bernanke starts running those printing presses even faster than he's already doing, we are going to have a serious recession.
SNT.80308.12281	The dollar's going to collapse, the bond market's going to collapse.
SNT.80308.12282	In recent months, the U.S. dollar has taken several other significant hits including Kuwait's decision in May to also break its dollar peg, and threats by China to interfere with the U.S. economy, calling it their nation's "nuclear option".
SNT.80308.12283	According to public sources, the Chinese government has begun a concerted campaign of economic threats against the United States, hinting that it may liquidate its vast holding of US treasuries if Washington imposes trade sanctions that seek to force a Yuan revaluation.
SNT.141684.12284	Gabon's new president Ali Ben Bongo has named his first government, after winning the country's recent presidential elections.
SNT.141684.12285	Bongo has kept interim Prime Minister Paul Mba, who has served in the post since July when his predecessor stepped down to run against Bongo.
SNT.141684.12286	Angelique Ngoma was moved from her position as minister of families to the defense minister — the first time that a woman has held that post in Gabon.
SNT.141684.12287	President Bongo was defense minister in the previous government of his father, Omar Bongo, who died in June after ruling for forty years.
SNT.141684.12288	In all, a dozen members of the new government are veterans of the previous administration.
SNT.141684.12289	Including himself and the prime minister, there are just 30 members of the new government.
SNT.141684.12290	Prime Minister Mba said the move "is aimed primarily at efficiency".
SNT.141684.12291	Francois Engongah Owono is the secretary general of the presidency.
SNT.141684.12292	Owono said that the new, smaller government will be more efficient and includes people determined to get everyone in Gabon working together for a better country.
SNT.141684.12293	Bongo was sworn in Saturday after a lengthy review of the August election that brought him to power.
SNT.141684.12294	Opposition candidates filed suit to overturn the results, accusing electoral officials of vote fraud to benefit the ruling party.
SNT.141684.12295	Gabon's constitutional court recounted returns from more than 2,800 polling stations and confirmed Bongo's win.
SNT.141684.12296	Most election observers believe the vote was fair, despite irregularities that included security forces at polling stations, some ballot boxes not being properly sealed, and the absence of opposition representatives during some vote counting.
SNT.141684.12297	Bongo has promised to improve health, education, and housing in Gabon and more equitably distribute oil revenue.
SNT.141684.12298	Under his father, Gabon became the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, but 70% of the population still live in poverty.
SNT.142610.12299	Chris Hughton has been appointed permanent manager of English football club Newcastle United, having previously served as its temporary caretaker manager since the start of the season.
SNT.142610.12300	His permanent contract was to run until the end of the 2010–11 season.
SNT.142610.12301	The 50 year old former Tottenham Hotspur and Republic of Ireland defender joined the club in 2008 when he was appointed Newcastle United assistant manager by Kevin Keegan, with the club at the time in the top flight of English football, the Premier League.
SNT.142610.12302	Hughton then became temporary Newcastle United caretaker manager twice last season, as managers came and went, and at the end of the season, the club were ultimately relegated to the second tier, the Football League Championship.
SNT.142610.12303	In his third spell as caretaker, he had been in charge of the club since the start of the season, and had guided the team to the top of the table, and for his efforts was awarded the Football League Championship Manager of the Month twice, for August and September.
SNT.142610.12304	"It's a very proud day for me to be named as the manager of this magnificent football club.
SNT.142610.12305	I will be doing everything in my power to get the club back into the Premier League at the first time of asking.
SNT.142610.12306	Having the unequivocal backing of the players has helped me enormously and I would also like to thank Colin Calderwood, Paul Barron and the rest of the backroom staff who have been tremendously supportive to me this season."
SNT.142610.12307	According to Sky Sports, many Newcastle fans had 'made no secret of their desire' to see a return to the club as manager of Alan Shearer after relegation and over the summer break.
SNT.142610.12308	Shearer, the former club captain, was hired on a short term 8 game contract at the end of last season, but could not steer the club away from relegation.
SNT.142610.12309	As the new season progressed, Hughton remained caretaker, and ten days prior to Hughton's appointment, Shearer had said:
SNT.142610.12310	"I can't revolve my life around that any more because I have other things going on.
SNT.142610.12311	If it happens, it happens, and if it doesn't, it doesn't...And at the moment Chris Hughton is doing a great job."
SNT.142610.12312	The announcement came on the same day as it announced that the club would be putting the naming rights of the club stadium St James' Park up for offers next season, and that owner Mike Ashley was taking the club off the market for a second time.
SNT.122591.12313	NASA has successfully launched Space Shuttle Discovery after over a month of delays.
SNT.122591.12314	Discovery lifted off at 7:43 p.m. (EDT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in the United States after NASA declared the weather to be "100% go for launch".
SNT.122591.12315	"The clouds broke up and that's why we were go for launch," stated mission control on NASA TV.
SNT.122591.12316	A crystal clear blue sky could be seen in Discovery's background about 40 minutes before launch.
SNT.122591.12317	NASA earlier had made jokes about a small black bat attached to the rear of the external fuel tank delaying launch, but NASA assured it would not be a problem for launch.
SNT.122591.12318	NASA also said that there was a bat on STS-72 which managed to fly away just before the shuttle launched.
SNT.122591.12319	The current scheduled mission, STS-119, is set to fly the Integrated Truss Structure segment ("S" for starboard, the right side of the station, and "6" for its place at the very end of the starboard truss) and install the final set of power-generating solar arrays to the International Space Station.
SNT.122591.12320	The arrays consist of two 115-foot-long arrays, for a total wing span of 240 feet, including the equipment that connects the two halves and allows them to twist as they track the sun.
SNT.122591.12321	Altogether, the four sets of arrays can generate 84 to 120 kilowatts of electricity – enough to provide power for more than 40 average homes.
SNT.122591.12322	Commander Lee Archambault will lead Discovery's crew of seven, along with Pilot Tony Antonelli, and Mission Specialists Joseph Acaba, John Phillips, Steve Swanson, Richard Arnold, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Koichi Wakata.
SNT.122591.12323	The next change scheduled the liftoff date for February 12, 2009.
SNT.122591.12324	It was then delayed until February 27, but was then delayed indefinitely on February 20 after NASA discovered an issue with the hydrogen control valves.
SNT.43708.12325	Patrick Viera and Thierry Henry scored second half goals to give France a 2-0 win over Togo in Group G, Friday.
SNT.43708.12326	A win that should have been a rout but for the number of almost unwatchable misses racked up by David Trezeguet and Frank Ribery.
SNT.43708.12327	The lack of French execution in front of goal had fans in the crowd jeering when they were 2-0 up.
SNT.43708.12328	This was very unfair on the French team, and particularly the brilliance of Patrick Viera, who were totally dominant as an attacking side and were much the better team in all areas - only to be let down by nerves in front of goal.
SNT.43708.12329	Before the game France were third in Group G with two points from two matches to Korea Republic's and Switzerland's four.
SNT.43708.12330	France had to win the game to get into the round of sixteen and the pressure seemed to be evident in the first half.
SNT.43708.12331	Out of seventeen French shots at goal nine found the area guarded by Kossi Agassa but the keeper did not have to produce a spectacular performance.
SNT.43708.12332	Togo did not play as much as a team as the French a fact reflected in their attack which forced Fabien Barthez to make just two saves.
SNT.43708.12333	Patrick Viera, on his 30th birthday, got the necessary goal on 55 minutes.
SNT.43708.12334	Ribery ran at the Togo defence and slipped a pass to Viera.
SNT.43708.12335	Inside the area with his back to goal, the Juventus man turned his defender and hit the ball hard to Agassa's left.
SNT.43708.12336	Viera's presence was noted by the eight fouls he suffered in the game; his excellence by the fact he conceded no fouls.
SNT.43708.12337	He also got an assist on the second goal when he flicked a header to Henry in the penalty area.
SNT.43708.12338	A typically clinical finish, Henry's first touch put the ball in a position to shoot before his marker could react.
SNT.43708.12339	Raymond Domenech's side win earned a round of sixteen match against Group H winners Spain.
SNT.521331.12340	The website of international news service Al Jazeera was hacked Tuesday by a group idenitified only as Al-Rashedon.
SNT.521331.12341	The type of group and its exact purposes are unclear at this stage, although it appears to be supportive of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
SNT.521331.12342	A screenshot of the hacked page contains the current Syrian flag displayed on the top left and a screenshot of a regular Al Jazeera homepage, overlaid by a graphic resembling a rubber stamp with the word "HACK" written on it and a silhouette of two men sitting at a desk.
SNT.521331.12343	As well as identifying the group which hacked the website in English and Arabic, the bottom left of the image also contains an Arabic language statement from the group criticising Al Jazeera for its coverage of the Syrian civil war.
SNT.521331.12344	When roughly translated, the message means: "We have hacked you because your lack of support of Syrian government and militant groups backed by that government.
SNT.521331.12345	We're compelled to do so on behalf of the Syrian people."
SNT.521331.12346	According to technological weblog Gizmodo, reports have emerged of the .net and not the .com version of the website being hacked.
SNT.521331.12347	The site reports that some users have not been able to access the website.
SNT.521331.12348	Wikinews contacted Al Jazeera English about the incident and as of 8:31pm UTC, had received no response.
SNT.19121.12349	A power outage in Indonesia that left about 100 million people without electricity has caused a political crisis.
SNT.19121.12350	The country's state-owned energy monopoly, PLN, has not determined the immediate cause, and the country's president has ordered the national intelligence agency and police to investigate.
SNT.19121.12351	The blackout appears related to deficiencies in Indonesia's power generation capacity.
SNT.19121.12352	The power failure follows attempts to deal with the country's growing energy crisis, including conservation and trying to allow private companies to provide energy, which was ruled unconstitutional in 2004.
SNT.19121.12353	In January, the Indonesian government held a special energy summit to attract investment in their energy infrastructure.
SNT.19121.12354	At the summit they set the goal of adding 22,000 megawatts to Indonesia's present capacity of 23,000 megawatts, in order to support the country's growth.
SNT.19121.12355	The World Bank and others have warned that without more investment in the country's energy infrastructure an energy deficit will result.
SNT.19121.12356	"The power outage has resulted in worries over an energy crisis which could hurt the nation's industrial sector," said a trader on Indonesia's stock market.
SNT.19121.12357	The outage began at 10:23 a.m. local time, August 18, 2005, when power failed along the electrical system that connects Java, Bali, and Madura, causing outages in Java and Bali.
SNT.19121.12358	Almost half of the country depends on the electrical grid that experienced failures.
SNT.19121.12359	The blackout caused traffic jams in Jakarta, forced cancellation of several international and domestic flights at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, shut down Jakarta's electric train service, and disrupted hospital operations.
SNT.19121.12360	Some larger hospitals were forced to delay surgeries while many smaller hospitals could not receive patients.
SNT.19121.12361	About 1,800 officers were called into action by Jakarta's metropolitan police to deal with short-term problems caused by the power failure.
SNT.19121.12362	Candles used in place of electric lighting started six fires in Jakarta alone.
SNT.19121.12363	Mulyo Aji, a PLN official, said more power failures are likely in the future as energy demand increases, without any corresponding new supplies of electricity scheduled to come online soon.
SNT.81976.12364	5,580 Hong Kong citizens participated in a umbrella unfurling campaign, which was organized by the pan-democrats in order to support having full universal suffrage in 2012.
SNT.81976.12365	The participants gathered in Victoria Park and unfurled yellow umbrellas forming the numbers 2012 against a background of blue umbrellas.
SNT.81976.12366	The organizers had prepared 10,080 umbrellas, 3,144 in yellow and 6,936 in blue.
SNT.81976.12367	However, since the event was not as popular as expected, about four thousand blue ones were left undistributed.
SNT.81976.12368	Nevertheless, Ronny Tong, an organizer from Civic Party, said he was satisfied with the turnout.
SNT.81976.12369	Anson Chan, the former Chief Secretary and one of the candidates of the upcoming by-election in the Legislative Council, also participated in this event.
SNT.81976.12370	Currently, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is elected by a election committee of 800 people, and most of them heavily favour PRC government.
SNT.81976.12371	Also, only half of the seats in Legislative Council is directly elected, and another half is elected by less than 5% of citizens.
SNT.81976.12372	Therefore, the pan-democrats in Hong Kong demand to have universal suffrage in the next elections in 2012.
SNT.465303.12373	Bruce, Canberra — Earlier today at the Australian Institute of Sport, Australia's Minister for Sport Kate Lundy and the Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott were on hand when the Australian Olympic Team formally announced the Australian artistic gymnastics team to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
SNT.465303.12374	Melbourne-based Georgia Bonora and Ashleigh Brennan, Perth residents Emily Little and Lauren Mitchell, and Brisbane resident Larrissa Miller booked their trip to London.
SNT.465303.12375	Lundy announced the government's A$4.5 million support for the Green and Gold Room in London.
SNT.465303.12376	This facility, supported by the Australian Institute of Sport's experts, enables performance analysis to help the Australian Olympians excel during the London Games.
SNT.465303.12377	Lundy also mentioned Gillard's Prime Ministers Challenge, which is not just for Australia's Olympians and Paralympians, but seeks to encourage the nation's young to play sports.
SNT.465303.12378	Abbott started off with a quip that the only gymnastics he participates in is verbal gymnastics.
SNT.465303.12379	The opposition leader then told the media present that Australia's Olympians have the country's support, and congratulated the competitors on the hard work they have put in for over ten years to get there.
SNT.465303.12380	In a conversation with a Wikinews reporter following the press conference, Miller said the team does not feel pressure from the media or other teams to do well.
SNT.465303.12381	They are very team-oriented and when it is time to compete, they ignore everything else going on and focus on performing their best.
SNT.465303.12382	The team does not need to worry about anything but competing because the gymnasts get support from Gymnastics Australia and the Australian Institute of Sport to cover the cost of everything they need.
SNT.465303.12383	With encouragement for the Olympians, Abbott and Lundy spent time on the trampoline.
SNT.465303.12384	In a show of bipartisan support, Abbott assisted Lundy out of the foam pit they jumped into, with Lundy returning the favour.
SNT.10942.12385	UN Secretary General Kofi Annan fired the first UN official in connection with the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal.
SNT.10942.12386	"After a thorough review of all aspects of the case, the Secretary General has decided that Mr. Joseph Stephanides be summarily dismissed for serious misconduct in accordance with UN staff regulations," relayed spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
SNT.10942.12387	"Mr Stephanides was advised accordingly yesterday and separated from service with immediate effect.
SNT.10942.12388	This is a disciplinary action for a breach of staff rules regarding procurement."
SNT.10942.12389	The investigation concluded that Stephanides infringed on regulations by helping the British company, Lloyds Register Inspection Ltd., win a contract under the UN programme for Iraq.
SNT.10942.12390	Mr. Stephanides acted as the head of the Security Council Affairs Division when he allegedly told the company how much to lower its price to be awarded a contract.
SNT.10942.12391	He denies any wrong-doing and hired a lawyer to defend himself.
SNT.10942.12392	Aged 59, Stephanides worked for the UN for 25 years, and was due to retire in September this year.
SNT.10942.12393	After a first food-for-oil interim report was released in February, Mr. Stephanides along with Benon Sevan were suspended.
SNT.10942.12394	Sevan, the former head of the oil-for-food programme for 6 years, was also accused of breach of procurement rules in the report co-written by Paul Volcker.
SNT.10942.12395	However, disciplinary measures against Sevan will not be carried out because of his status of diplomatic immunity.
SNT.10942.12396	A final report is scheduled for publication in three months which should further clarify whether Mr. Sevan received Iraqi oil allocations for a friend's company.
SNT.10942.12397	In the meantime, he remains suspended from all UN duties, and is being given only a symbolic salary of one dollar a year.
SNT.10942.12398	A central and unanswered question, is whether either Stephanides or Sevan profited directly by their actions in executing and implementing the complex programme.
SNT.55457.12399	University of Miami head football coach Larry Coker was fired today after a five win, five loss season.
SNT.55457.12400	He was fired after a disappointing season which was filled with controversy and tragedy.
SNT.55457.12401	On October 14th, a brawl in a game against Florida International University led to the suspension of 13 UM players.
SNT.55457.12402	On November 7th, starting defensive lineman Bryan Pata was shot and killed outside his apartment in Kendall.
SNT.55457.12403	The Hurricanes also went though a four game losing streak.
SNT.55457.12404	"We have suffered disappointments and tragedy off and on the field," University of Miami President Donna Shalala said in a statement regarding Coker's firing.
SNT.55457.12405	Coker firing came one day after a 17-14 win over 17th ranked Boston College.
SNT.55457.12406	Coker may coach one more game if the Hurricanes get selected for a bowl game.
SNT.55457.12407	University of Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano and former University of Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez has emerged as one of the top candidates.
SNT.144219.12408	Voting polls opened in Kosovo at 7am (0600 UTC); the first time since declaring independence from Serbia last year.
SNT.144219.12409	Both ethnic Albanians and the minority Serb population may vote for local mayors and councillors, a move seen as testing the government's capacity to organise its own democratic elections.
SNT.144219.12410	The territory was run by the United Nations mission before its split from Serbia in February 2008.
SNT.144219.12411	The Kosovo police have tightened security, and the 13,000 Kosovo Force troops — a NATO-led peacekeeping force — are on standby, according to its commander, General Markus Bentler.
SNT.144219.12412	The main concern is the number of citizens who will vote, as only a 40% turnout level is expected.
SNT.144219.12413	According to the BBC, most of the 120,000 Serbs oppose Kosovo's independence.
SNT.144219.12414	The government in Belgrade and the Serbian Orthodox Church have called for a boycott.
SNT.144219.12415	Polling stations are due to close at 7pm (1800 UTC); the first unofficial results are expected late Sunday evening.
SNT.53542.12416	Repeated incidents of controversial approaches of Israeli F-16 jets to German military vessels, as well as claims of the opposition parties that Angela Merkel's government had tricked them into approving Germany's Lebanon mission cause ongoing controversies surrounding the historical deployment of Bundeswehr troops to the Middle East.
SNT.53542.12417	The latest event to hit the headlines today was an encounter of a German helicopter with two Israeli jets off the Lebanese coast during the night of Thursday to Friday.
SNT.53542.12418	Meanwhile, German State Secretary of Defence Peter Wichert is said to be under pressure over a growing row surrounding the German UNIFIL mandate: opposition politicians accuse the government of having misinformed them prior to the parliamentary approved for the Lebanon mission regarding the constraints of the German forces UN mandate.
SNT.53542.12419	In particular, limited freedom to act within the 6-miles-zone of the Lebanese coast is seen as endangering the efficiency and feasibility of the Bundeswehr controlling arms smuggling.
SNT.53542.12420	Peter Wichert apparently was responsible for an unclear statement which Angela Merkel supposedly sees as the cause of the current conflict.
SNT.27164.12421	After Kenyans voted "no" for the implementation of the new constitution, the "Orange" anti-constitution campaign and the "Banana" pro-constitution campaign finally sat down together to discuss the way forward.
SNT.27164.12422	The draft constitution would have banned foreign land ownership, set the prime minister position to report to the country's president, banned same-sex marriages and restricted regional political parties.
SNT.27164.12423	It would have also given women equal rights to inherit property, and addressed local elections.
SNT.27164.12424	This draft constitution was brought forward by the Attorney General, Amos Wako.
SNT.27164.12425	A day after the results were announced, the President of the country, Mwai Kibaki, fired his whole cabinet.
SNT.27164.12426	It is not yet known what he plans to do, but hopes for reconciliation are high: a member of the opposition called on the president "to provide leadership in the way forward".
SNT.200857.12427	US professional wrestler and former World Wrestling Entertainment star Lance Cade has been found dead at the age of 29.
SNT.200857.12428	The cause of death was announced by Cade’s father as apparent heart failure.
SNT.200857.12429	Cade, whose real name is Lance McNaught was trained by former world champion Shawn Michaels and made his professional debut in 1999.
SNT.200857.12430	After working in Japan, Cade signed with World Wrestling Entertainment, the largest wrestling promotion in the United States.
SNT.200857.12431	In 2003 Cade made his first appearance on television and teamed with Mark Jindrak.
SNT.200857.12432	After one year the team split and Cade was tagged with another wrestler.
SNT.200857.12433	With Trevor Murdoch, Cade won the World Tag Team Championship three times in as many years.
SNT.200857.12434	After five years in the company Cade was released from his contract in October 2008.
SNT.200857.12435	He was later re-hired in 2009 but again released the next year.
SNT.200857.12436	World Wrestling Entertainment released a statement on the death Cade through its website.
SNT.200857.12437	It read “World Wrestling Entertainment was informed Friday morning by Lance McNaught’s father that he has passed away of apparent heart failure.
SNT.200857.12438	Former Tag Team Champion Matt Hardy and WWE legend Mick Foley paid tributes to Cade.
SNT.79163.12439	Typhoon Fitow has struck Japan, leaving two people dead and a third missing.
SNT.79163.12440	The Japan Meteorological Agency released the information on the storm's effects in the country yesterday.
SNT.79163.12441	The deceased are a 50-year-old construction worker who died after a landslide at a dam construction site in Fukui Prefecture last night and a 76-year-old man who died after being struck by a falling tree on September 6, shortly after Fitow made landfall.
SNT.79163.12442	A 52-year-old man is missing in Kanagawa Prefecture, believed to be dead, and at least 60 people have been injured by the storm.
SNT.79163.12443	According to information released by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, around 200 buildings have been destroyed or badly damaged by the typhoon.
SNT.79163.12444	A total of 5,000 people have been told to evacuate, 3,000 last night in Miyagi Prefecture.
SNT.79163.12445	Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, Japan's two largest air carriers, both said 240 domestic and eight international flights have been cancelled as a direct result of the storm, which is expected to be immediately followed by Tropical Storm Danas.
SNT.79163.12446	Fitow is now moving towards the Sea of Okhotsk, making progress at about 24 miles per hour.
SNT.79163.12447	It is predicted that the storm will deposit anything up to 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rainfall on areas on the Pacific coast, possibly triggering flash floods.
SNT.25893.12448	Sir Paul McCartney is scheduled on Saturday, November 12, to perform the first concert broadcast live into space.
SNT.25893.12449	Performing in Anaheim, CA, McCartney will awaken astronaut Bill McArther and cosmonaut Valery Tokarev on the International Space Station.
SNT.25893.12450	Songs played will include "English Tea" from his newly-released album "Chaos and Creation in the Backyard."
SNT.25893.12451	Also on the playlist is the Beatles classic "Good Day Sunshine".
SNT.25893.12452	The idea for the show originally came from a report McCartney received about "Good Day Sunshine" being used to wake astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery as it prepared to land in August.
SNT.25893.12453	Said Sir Paul "I was extremely proud to find out that one of my songs was played for Discovery this summer.
SNT.25893.12454	This event will mark the first time a live music show is broadcast into space.
SNT.25893.12455	It should be noted that only his voice will be heard, as there is no video feed from the site.
SNT.25893.12456	The former Beatle has seen interest in his work climb recently with the release of a critically-acclaimed album and a children's book, as well as a series of American commercials feature songs from his new album and a collage of video clips and photos detailing his life's work.
SNT.111258.12457	At least three people are dead after two small planes collided in a remote area of Wyoming in the United States.
SNT.111258.12458	The collision occurred between a Cirrus SR22 and a Cessna 172 near Rock Springs just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.
SNT.111258.12459	The Cirrus was carrying two people, both of whom died, and was traveling from Polson, Montana to Rock Springs.
SNT.111258.12460	The Cessna had one person on board who also died, but its destination is not yet known.
SNT.111258.12461	One deployed parachute is reported to have been seen near the wreckage, but reports state it does not appear to have been deployed by a survivor.
SNT.111258.12462	FOX News quotes KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah as saying that debris from the collision was scattered over five acres in an area that made it difficult for emergency officials to get to.
SNT.111258.12463	The names of the deceased have not been released, pending the notification of family members.
SNT.79857.12464	An aircraft dating back to the Second World War has crashed at Shoreham Airshow in West Sussex, United Kingdom whilst participating in a mock dogfight, killing the pilot.
SNT.79857.12465	The plane was with the Royal Air Forces Association and had been performing in a Battle of Britain display.
SNT.79857.12466	Witness Tim Deakin described the chain of events to BBC News 24: "The main point of the show was a Second World War dogfight between some Messerschmitts and some Spitfires.
SNT.79857.12467	Midway through the dogfight one of the planes, I'm not sure which one, literally, turned quite steeply, went into almost a straight dive and ploughed into a hill probably about a mile from the airfield.
SNT.79857.12468	There's still quite a bit of confusion about which aircraft it was."
SNT.79857.12469	Witness Holly Russell had some more details: "They were doing a mock dog fight and it looked like the plane was doing a dive, but it was going too fast and smashed straight into the ground.
SNT.79857.12470	Authorities could not confirm any injuries or fatalities, but the missing man formation was performed in a flyby shortly after the crash.
SNT.79857.12471	The plane went down into a field near the A27, about a mile from the airfield.
SNT.79857.12472	The plane was a Hurricane, one of three performing alongside the two Spitfires and five Messerschmitts.
SNT.79857.12473	The show is thought to have been attended by about 20,000 people, and was delayed by about 30 minutes after the crash.
SNT.79857.12474	However, eventually a tannoy (PA) announcement stated that the pilot "would have wanted them to carry on", and the show continued.
SNT.79857.12475	The crash occurred on the first day of the two days the annual airshow is scheduled to take.
SNT.79857.12476	Officials have requested for anyone filming the airshow at the time to come forward in the hope that the footage will assist in investigating the cause of the crash.
SNT.158756.12477	An inquest was held this week after a 10-year-old boy died after being shot with an air rifle in Swansea, Wales.
SNT.158756.12478	On September 27, 2009, Rhys Johnson and his friend, aged 12, took, without permission, an air gun which belonged to Rhys' father.
SNT.158756.12479	The two boys played with it near to the location of the Johnson house in the district of Llansamlet.
SNT.158756.12480	They were unsupervised when they were shooting the gun at a bucket that was hanging in a tree and a tin can that was placed on a box.
SNT.158756.12481	The friend, who has remained anonymous, shot Rhys Johnson in the heart with the .22 caliber Webley Vulcan air gun at close range.
SNT.158756.12482	Johnson died in a hospital at 0211 BST the next day from said wound.
SNT.158756.12483	Philip Rogers, a coroner from Swansea, recorded the verdict as an accidental death.
SNT.158756.12484	He was told that the friend had no intention of shooting Johnson.
SNT.158756.12485	Therefore, no legal action has been taken against Johnson's friend accordingly.
SNT.158756.12486	The boy held the rifle at the butt in his right arm with his finger on the trigger.
SNT.158756.12487	As he turned he felt the gun to be heavy.
SNT.158756.12488	As it fell away he pulled it towards him and accidentally fired the trigger.
SNT.158756.12489	Rhys was holding himself to the chest—he thought he was joking then he thought he's shot Rhys in the hand.
SNT.158756.12490	He saw no blood and Rhys ran to the house."
SNT.158756.12491	The detective stated that the friend "was crying and apologizing for what happened."
SNT.158756.12492	Rhys Johnson's father, David, age 36, an engineer in a workshop and the owner of the air rifle testified, "I would allow him to use it if he was with me when I was up the garden or we were spending time together.
SNT.158756.12493	Rhys would have shown interest in it from when he was about eight-years-old."
SNT.158756.12494	The coroner urged "anyone with children to try and ensure that such weapons are not used without parental supervision," going on to say that he was "sure Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were not aware the children were using the weapon unsupervised."
SNT.77822.12495	Larry Craig, the senior United States Senator for Idaho, was arrested at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in Minnesota after pleading guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct.
SNT.77822.12496	He has been forced to pay US$575 in fees and serve 10 days in jail, and has been put on unsupervised probation for a period of one year.
SNT.77822.12497	Craig was arrested on June 11th after an undercover police officer reported lewd conduct in one of the men's restrooms.
SNT.77822.12498	At the time, he stated, "I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions.
SNT.77822.12499	After his arrest, he stated, "I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter.
SNT.77822.12500	I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously".
SNT.77822.12501	He has served in the United States Senate continuously since 1991, and was a United States Representative from 1981 to 1991.
SNT.77822.12502	Earlier, he was elected to the Idaho State Senate in 1974, 1976 and 1978.
SNT.77822.12503	Craig is married, and adopted the three children his wife had had from a previous marriage.
SNT.77822.12504	Craig had previously faced allegations of homosexual behavior, and in 1982 went on network news to deny rumors involving cocaine and sex with male in congressional pages.
SNT.77822.12505	He is considered a social conservative in his voting record, and supported a Federal Marriage Amendment to bar same-sex marriage.
SNT.57908.12506	The head of the United States National Nuclear Security Administration, Linton Brooks, has been forced to resign due to security issues.
SNT.57908.12507	United States Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman asked for Brooks' resignation because of issues including "serious security breaches" in several laboratories, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
SNT.57908.12508	In a statement issued by Bodman, issues such as lab management were brought up.
SNT.57908.12509	:"The deputy secretary and I repeatedly have stressed to NNSA and laboratory management the importance of these issues being addressed, rectified and prevented in the future.
SNT.57908.12510	While I believe that the current NNSA management has done its best to address these concerns, I do not believe that progress in correcting these issues has been adequate."
SNT.57908.12511	Brooks issued a statement to President Bush, and NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration) employees, saying that he would resign "shortly".
SNT.51482.12512	Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the FIA Formula-1 2006 Sinopec Chinese Grand Prix on the Shanghai International Circuit.
SNT.51482.12513	Although the wet weekend was more suitable for the Michelin-tyred cars, Schumacher overtook both Renault drivers to win the race.
SNT.51482.12514	Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisicella started from the first line of the grid, but were unable to hold the old champion behind.
SNT.51482.12515	The situation became irreversible after Alonso's second pit-stop, where he was delayed for more then ten seconds longer then usual because of the problems with the right rear wheel.
SNT.51482.12516	After that, he pushed hard on the leaders, easily overtaking his teammate and closing the gap to the "Red Baron" to about 3 seconds for the final lap.
SNT.51482.12517	Tough luck for Fernando, pit-stop problem spoiled a fantastic battle.
SNT.51482.12518	The other battle for the fifth place involving two Honda's, Nick Heifeld, Takuma Sato (+1 lap) and Christijan Albers (+3 laps) took place on the last lap when the slight rain touches the track.
SNT.51482.12519	After it the Honda team driver Rubens Barichello lose the nose of his car in a hit of BMW Sauber, while his teammate, Jenson Button, has secured his fourth place (Rubens was included in the final standings on the sixth place).
SNT.51482.12520	Incident is currently under investigation by stewards - Sato and Albers could be penalized for ignoring waving blue flags.
SNT.51482.12521	Felipe Massa, the second Ferrari driver, penalized for engine change, was out due to a collision with David Coulthard from the Red Bull team.
SNT.51482.12522	McLaren-Mercedes driver Kimi Raikkonen was first to park his car on the side of the track once again due to technical problems, while his teammate Pedro de la Rosa managed a good result.
SNT.51482.12523	He regained two points more from Alonso in the drivers' championship - now they both have 116 points, though Renault team now returned the lead in the constructors' championship for just one point.
SNT.51015.12524	Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Kaur confirmed today that Mohammed Afzal, a militant attached to the Pakistan-based outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, would be executed on 20 October for his role in the attempted attack on the Indian Parliament building in 2002.
SNT.51015.12525	On 13 December 2001, at 11:45 a.m. local time(UTC+5:30), just as the MPs were preparing to leave the House, militants armed with AK-47s and hand-grenades breached the security at Gate No.12 of the Parliament Building and opened indiscriminate fire, killing six policemen and one Parliament employee.
SNT.51015.12526	The Army, along with police and NSG "Black Cats" sealed the area and killed all five gunmen in a "lock-down mop-up" operation.
SNT.51015.12527	The attack increased tensions between India and Pakistan, which was accused by India of providing support to the Kashmiri militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, involved in the attack.
SNT.51015.12528	A special court had earlier sentenced Delhi University lecturer S. Geelani, Afzal and Shaukat Hussain Guru to death under Section 3(2) of POTA (indulging in terrorist acts leading to deaths) and Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (murder).
SNT.51015.12529	The court also fined Shaukat Hussain's wife, Afsan Guru Rs. 10,000 and sentenced her to five years rigorous imprisonment for concealing details of the plot.
SNT.51015.12530	A Delhi High court ruling, however, later acquitted Afsana Guru and Geelani.
SNT.51015.12531	On 4 August 2005, a Supreme Court bench including Justice P V Reddy and Justice P V Neolkar confirmed the death penalty for Mohammed Afzal and sentenced Shaukat Hussain Guru to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for concealing details of the conspiracy, thereby sparing him the gallows.
SNT.51015.12532	Although the Supreme Court upheld Geelani's acquittal, it observed that his actions were not above suspicion and seemed to have supported the attack.
SNT.89154.12533	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas held a final meeting Tuesday before their separate talks with United States President Bush this week during his visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories.
SNT.89154.12534	Just hours before President Bush is due to touch down in Israel, Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas met in Jerusalem.
SNT.89154.12535	Neither man issued any public statements following the meeting, but they instructed their negotiators to form working groups to discuss core issues such as the status of Jerusalem, Israel's borders with a future Palestinian state and the issue of Palestinian refugees.
SNT.89154.12536	The talks are supposed to lead to the formation of a Palestinian state by the end of this year.
SNT.89154.12537	Talks between the two sides have been bogged down since last November's Annapolis, Maryland Mideast peace conference, with Palestinians angry over continued Israeli settlement expansion in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and Israelis angry over continued Palestinian militant attacks.
SNT.89154.12538	Mahdi Abdel Hadi who heads the Palestinian research group PASSIA says both Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas are politically weakened, and it is unlikely either man can probably give the other what he wants.
SNT.89154.12539	"I think both leaders, Olmert and Abbas are weak, vis-à-vis their constituencies," he explained.
SNT.89154.12540	"It is what they can deliver to their own societies.
SNT.89154.12541	Olmert is facing challenges by other leaders to take over the prime ministership.
SNT.89154.12542	Abbas is challenged by the partition between Gaza and the West Bank and there have been no improvements to the quality of life under occupation."
SNT.89154.12543	Since their last meeting with Mr. Bush at the Annapolis Mideast peace conference, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Olmert have each accused the other of reneging on pledges to advance the peace process.
SNT.89154.12544	Now it will be up to Mr. Bush to see if he can get Mr. Abbas and Mr. Olmert to bridge their differences and get the peace process that was revived at Annapolis back on track.
SNT.47532.12545	Three people in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and one person in Quebec won last week's Lotto 649.
SNT.47532.12546	They will share the second-largest lottery jackpot in Canadian history as the lucky winners of Saturday's $43.2-million Lotto 649 draw.
SNT.47532.12547	Eight Dollarama employees in downtown Toronto also held one of the winning tickets, worth more than $10.8 million.
SNT.47532.12548	The biggest Lotto win was $54 million in a Lotto 649 draw in October 2005.
SNT.47532.12549	It was won by 17 oil company workers in Camrose, Alberta.
SNT.122707.12550	The Seattle Post-Intelligencer (P-I), the 146-year-old Seattle newspaper, will make its final print edition on today, before becoming an online-only news agency.
SNT.122707.12551	However, the online version is to be for local news only.
SNT.122707.12552	The editorial staff would consist of twenty people, less than one-seventh of the 150 staff that were employed before the closure.
SNT.122707.12553	With this closure, the Seattle Times is now Seattle's only major daily newspaper.
SNT.122707.12554	"We don't feel like we have to cover everything ourselves.
SNT.122707.12555	We'll partner for some content; we won't duplicate what the wire is reporting unless we have something unique to offer; we'll continue to showcase the great content from our 150 or so reader bloggers and we'll link to content partners and competitors to create the best mix of news on our front page," said Michelle Nicolosi, who is to be the executive producer of the online paper.
SNT.122707.12556	The Hearst Corporation, the owner of the P-I, was not able to find a buyer for the newspaper when it was put up for sale back in January.
SNT.122707.12557	The newspaper industry in the country has been suffering as revenue from advertising plunges.
SNT.122707.12558	Other newspapers in the United States have also shut down recently: Denver's Rocky Mountain News shut down earlier this year, whilst the Tucson Citizen of Arizona will print its final edition on Saturday.
SNT.103071.12559	While nearly all cover of the 2008 Presidential election has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third party candidates.
SNT.103071.12560	These parties represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.
SNT.103071.12561	As a non-partisan news source, Wikinews has impartially reached out to these candidates, who are looking to become the 43rd person elected to serve their nation from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.
SNT.103071.12562	Wikinews' own Patrick Mannion corresponded with the Socialist Party USA nominee and candidate, Brian Moore via e-mail.
SNT.47811.12563	Melbourne man Jack Thomas has been acquitted of terrorism offences in Victoria's Court of Appeal.
SNT.47811.12564	His convictions for receiving funds from a terror group and using a false passport were quashed on Friday.
SNT.47811.12565	Mr Thomas was earlier sentenced to five years in jail.
SNT.47811.12566	Jack Thomas, 33, known as "Jihad Jack" was convicted under new Australian anti-terror laws.
SNT.47811.12567	He was found guilty in February of accepting cash and a plane ticket from an al-Qaeda agent in Pakistan.
SNT.47811.12568	The former taxi driver was sentenced to five years in prison in March.
SNT.47811.12569	The Court of Appeal ruled Thomas's interview with Australian Federal Police (AFP) in Pakistan was inadmissible.
SNT.47811.12570	Thomas appealed his conviction on the grounds that interviews conducted in Pakistan after his arrest in 2003 breached Australian law and should not have been allowed as evidence at his trial.
SNT.47811.12571	He was interviewed without access to a lawyer, having already been interrogated during two months in custody in Pakistan.
SNT.47811.12572	Mr Thomas' lawyers argued that he was earlier threatened with torture from foreign security agencies.
SNT.47811.12573	His lawyer said Mr Thomas, who is married and has three children, accepted the money and plane ticket because he wanted to return home.
SNT.47811.12574	Mr Thomas said he never had any intention of becoming an al-Qaeda operative.
SNT.47811.12575	Lawyer Rob Stary said Thomas wanted to thank his legal team and staff at a hospital he had spent the past several months in psychiatric care.
SNT.47811.12576	"He's in a debilitated condition as a result of what's transpired," Mr Stary said.
SNT.47811.12577	Liberty Victoria president Brian Walters, SC, welcomed the decision, saying: "We believe that the Court of Appeal has righted a great injustice."
SNT.47811.12578	Prosecutor Nick Robinson is calling for a retrial based on a television interview with the ABC.
SNT.47811.12579	Rob Stary said the defence team would counter with arguments that prosecutors withheld a statement from a prisoner now held overseas.
SNT.47811.12580	"The AFP has withheld important information that would have contradicted other evidence," he said.
SNT.109503.12581	At least seven United Nations peacekeepers are dead, and nearly two dozen wounded, after Janjaweed militants in Darfur, Sudan, ambushed their convoy around 11:45 GMT.
SNT.109503.12582	Five of those troops were from the African nation of Rwanda.
SNT.109503.12583	Troops fought with militants for over two hours after militants ambushed their convoy of 40 armoured vehicles.
SNT.109503.12584	Hafiz Mohammed, who leads the Sudan program at Justice Africa in London, England, says the latest attack reflects the deteriorating security situation on the ground and that everyone in Sudan is at risk of being attacked.
SNT.109503.12585	Instead of actually protecting the civilians, they will end up not able even to protect themselves.
SNT.109503.12586	It's going to discourage countries to contribute to the unit, which is creating problems.
SNT.109503.12587	This is the security situation in Darfur, nobody is immune from being attacked," said Mohammed.
SNT.109503.12588	The U.N. has condemned the attack releasing a statement saying, "the secretary-general (Ban Ki-moon) condemns in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable act of extreme violence against AU-U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur and calls on the government of Sudan to do its utmost to ensure that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice."
SNT.109503.12589	The peacekeepers are part of a joint African Union-U.N. mission aimed at putting 26,000 troops in the region.
SNT.109503.12590	So far only around 10,000 of that planned mission have been ordered to the region.
SNT.109503.12591	Countries unwilling to contribute forces, and constant government restrictions from Sudan, have contributed to the slow movement of troops to the region.
SNT.38992.12592	A Saudi Arabian man named Abu Marwan al-Suri, 38, suspected of being a senior al-Qaeda "bag man", was killed in a shootout on Thursday, according to the Pakistan army spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan.
SNT.38992.12593	It is believed he has been killed at a checkpoint in Khar, a town in the tribal district of Bajaur, Pakistan, when he opened fire on security officials from inside a car.
SNT.38992.12594	According to Sultan, al-Suri opened fire when asked to stop his car.
SNT.38992.12595	Al-Suri wounded two people and killed one Pakistani security official.
SNT.38992.12596	"His death is quite a significant blow to al-Qaeda," said officials.
SNT.38992.12597	"He was giving them money every three months," said officials.
SNT.38992.12598	Pakistani officials say they have his body and that it will be examined to determine its true identity at a hospital in the city of Peshawar.
SNT.38992.12599	Officials also say a notebook with instructions in Arabic on making bombs and explosive devices was found with al-Suri.
SNT.36873.12600	The document goes on to call the investigation 'invalid', 'completely without merit' and 'careless'.
SNT.36873.12601	The last 12 pages of this comprehensive rebuttal are responses to specific article criticisms, mainly consisting of differences of opinion on style and article composition, but some citing outright factual errors on Natures part.
SNT.36873.12602	In their response, Nature refused to reveal their original data for comparison, and commented that Britannica had raised their grievances in private some time ago, and then received no further correspondence until Britannicas open letter of 22 March 2006.
SNT.36873.12603	Nature notes that Britannica criticised 'less than half the points [their] reviewers raised', and states that the two encyclopædias were subject to the same treatment.
SNT.36873.12604	Wikipedia has been stigmatised as unreliable due to its open-source nature and a perceived problem with vandalism.
SNT.36873.12605	The December 2005 study was seen at the time as a major boost to the credibility of Wikipedia.
SNT.36873.12606	Jimmy Wales was notified by one of his team members, on 27 January 2006 that all corrections provided by Nature were in place.
SNT.36873.12607	Recent changes to some of the Wikipedia editing policies have attempted to resolve some of the reliability issues raised.
SNT.54576.12608	Students in hundreds of schools around New Zealand are given NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement) credits for simple, everyday tasks, an investigation by The New Zealand Herald on Sunday shows.
SNT.54576.12609	The simple standards include: applying for a benefit, keeping healthy, talking and listening to a friend, wrapping a gift, dressing appropriately, washing clothes, working in a group, understanding the concept of friendship, ordering groceries either over the phone or in person.
SNT.54576.12610	One of the standards include coming to school on time and good behaviour for 20 days, it appears on the students records as: "Work and Study Skills: Demonstrate Care and Timeliness as an Employee".
SNT.54576.12611	Bill English, Member of Parliament for National and the education spokesman for National, said: "The easy credits demotivated students.
SNT.54576.12612	Take someone who's struggling with maths and works hard to get four or five credits - and then they see their mate getting three credits for holding a conversation...
SNT.54576.12613	That's something that children learn when they're 2, 3, 4...
SNT.54576.12614	All those standards are available to any student who goes to a school which is accredited to assess the standard internally.
SNT.54576.12615	The standards are not made up by the school but are real standards written by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA).
SNT.54576.12616	The NZQA said, on Friday, that the standards would be marked down as "special supported learning" but recently they went back on that and said that now the credits are "mainstream and not differentiated on NCEA records."
SNT.54576.12617	The chief executive of NZQA, Bali Haque, said: "Level one was absolutely basic and the delivery of unit standards was a developing process.
SNT.54576.12618	The intention here is to recognise the learning that people have done, and give them credit for it."
SNT.54576.12619	Mr Haque admits that this system "is not perfect" but is adamant that schools will not exploit the imperfect system as to boost pass rates, unlike in 2004 when Cambridge High School used legitimate standards to boost pass rates.
SNT.54576.12620	The school used one standard that was titled "Interpersonal Communications: Participate in a team or group to complete routine tasks," and all the student had to do was pick up rubbish in a group.
SNT.54576.12621	The dean of education at the University of Auckland, John Langley, said: "The other standards are meaningless.
SNT.54576.12622	I turned 51 last week and I still can't gift wrap a parcel - and actually, it doesn't matter.
SNT.54576.12623	The authority needed to look at what the NCEA standards were and how they were applied."
SNT.54576.12624	"It is better to offer people those sorts of simple, unsophisticated qualifications than not to - as long as people understand the purpose," Mr Haque said.
SNT.54576.12625	The secondary principals' association head, Graham Young, said: "The NCEA system put pressure on schools to accumulate credits - and the easiest way to do that was to encourage students into internally assessed unit standards.
SNT.54576.12626	There are some very low-level unit standards which are extraordinarily easy to pass...
SNT.54576.12627	For people with above-average or average abilities to be using those unit standards is absolute nonsense."
SNT.54576.12628	Spokesman, Gilbert Peterson, for the employers and manufacturers association, said: "The titles of particular standards meant nothing to employers faced with a big grab bag of assessments.
SNT.54576.12629	Getting credits for doing the washing or talking to your mate is just amazing.
SNT.54576.12630	However Mr Haque said that he was confident employers would recognise the standards as basic, and that they were not misleading.
SNT.96450.12631	Thursday was the second day of play in the third test between Australia and India at the WACA, Perth, Australia.
SNT.96450.12632	Australia took the remaining four wickets before the lunch break.
SNT.96450.12633	Mahendra Singh Dhoni (19) and Irfan Pathan (28) both fell lbw in successive overs.
SNT.96450.12634	India reached 330 all out with the loss of Anil Kumble for one run and R. P. Singh for a duck.
SNT.96450.12635	Australia struggled early on as Irfan Pathan dismissed both Australian openers for less than ten runs each and Michael Hussey was caught behind without scoring.
SNT.96450.12636	The next session, Australia played well, despite losing Ricky Ponting (20) and Michael Clarke (23), coming to the tea break with a score of 5/148.
SNT.96450.12637	However, in the last session of the day India took five wickets, sending Australia all out with a score of 212 after fifty overs.
SNT.96450.12638	Andrew Symonds was Australia's top scorer with 66 runs, while Adam Gilchrist made 55.
SNT.96450.12639	In reply, India are 1/52 at stumps having lost Wasim Jaffer for 11 runs just before the close of play.
SNT.146935.12640	A suicide bomber at a volleyball game in northwestern Pakistan detonated a vehicle full of explosives Friday, killing at least 75 people and injuring scores more.
SNT.146935.12641	Some reports placed the number of dead as high as 88.
SNT.146935.12642	The explosion occurred in the town of Lakki Marwat in the North West Frontier Province, located nearby to the South and North Waziristan provinces, an area where Pakistani Taliban members are known to be active.
SNT.146935.12643	Reportedly, the attacker drove his car onto a volleyball field, where a game, being watched by many people, was being played.
SNT.146935.12644	Locals set up a militia and expelled the militants from this area.
SNT.146935.12645	This attack seems to be reaction to their expulsion," said, Ayub Khan, a local police chief, to media.
SNT.146935.12646	According to him, the attacker's vehicle contained 250 kilograms of highly intensive explosive material.
SNT.146935.12647	Buildings in the vicinity of the field, including a mosque were collapsed or damaged by the force of the blast.
SNT.146935.12648	"[W]e fear that some ten or so people might have been trapped in the rubble", Khan said.
SNT.146935.12649	Another security official, Khabib Khan, said that there were around three hundred people attending at the volleyball competition when the explosion happened.
SNT.146935.12650	We had it for the meeting, and for the tournament," he said to the Associated Press news agency over the telephone.
SNT.146935.12651	Malik Naveed, the provincial police chief, said to Voice of America that the attack may have been a retaliatory move against the residents of the town.
SNT.146935.12652	According to him, the village where the attack occurred was once considered a hub of Taliban fighters; however, he says, locals, with the help of authorities set up a militia force and either killed or expelled them from their area.
SNT.146935.12653	"These insurgents, they were not very happy about it and they were cut off because the people had risen against them.
SNT.146935.12654	So this was one way of taking revenge from these people," Naveed said.
SNT.146935.12655	This incident is the deadliest attack in Pakistan since October 28 of last year, when 112 people were killed by a car bomb in the city of Peshawar.
SNT.268775.12656	NASA's Cassini–Huygens spacecraft has discovered evidence for a large-scale saltwater reservoir beneath the icy crust of Saturn's moon Enceladus.
SNT.268775.12657	The data came from the spacecraft's direct analysis of salt-rich ice grains close to the jets ejected from the moon.
SNT.268775.12658	The study has been published in this week's edition of the journal Nature.
SNT.268775.12659	Data from Cassini's cosmic dust analyzer show the grains expelled from fissures, known as tiger stripes, are relatively small and usually low in salt far away from the moon.
SNT.268775.12660	Closer to the moon's surface, Cassini found that relatively large grains rich with sodium and potassium dominate the plumes.
SNT.268775.12661	The salt-rich particles have an "ocean-like" composition and indicate that most, if not all, of the expelled ice and water vapor comes from the evaporation of liquid salt-water.
SNT.268775.12662	When water freezes, the salt is squeezed out, leaving pure water ice behind.
SNT.268775.12663	Cassini's ultraviolet imaging spectrograph also recently obtained complementary results that support the presence of a subsurface ocean.
SNT.268775.12664	A team of Cassini researchers led by Candice Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, measured gas shooting out of distinct jets originating in the moon's south polar region at five to eight times the speed of sound, several times faster than previously measured.
SNT.268775.12665	These observations of distinct jets, from a 2010 flyby, are consistent with results showing a difference in composition of ice grains close to the moon's surface and those that made it out to the E ring, the outermost ring that gets its material primarily from Enceladean jets.
SNT.268775.12666	If the plumes emanated from ice, they should have very little salt in them.
SNT.268775.12667	"There currently is no plausible way to produce a steady outflow of salt-rich grains from solid ice across all the tiger stripes other than salt water under Enceladus's icy surface," said Frank Postberg, a Cassini team scientist at the University of Heidelberg in Germany.
SNT.268775.12668	The data suggests a layer of water between the moon's rocky core and its icy mantle, possibly as deep as about 50 miles (80 kilometers) beneath the surface.
SNT.268775.12669	As this water washes against the rocks, it dissolves salt compounds and rises through fractures in the overlying ice to form reserves nearer the surface.
SNT.268775.12670	If the outermost layer cracks open, the decrease in pressure from these reserves to space causes a plume to shoot out.
SNT.268775.12671	Roughly 400 pounds (200 kilograms) of water vapor is lost every second in the plumes, with smaller amounts being lost as ice grains.
SNT.268775.12672	The team calculates the water reserves must have large evaporating surfaces, or they would freeze easily and stop the plumes.
SNT.268775.12673	"We imagine that between the ice and the ice core there is an ocean of depth and this is somehow connected to the surface reservoir," added Postberg.
SNT.268775.12674	The Cassini mission discovered Enceladus' water-vapor and ice jets in 2005.
SNT.268775.12675	In 2009, scientists working with the cosmic dust analyzer examined some sodium salts found in ice grains of Saturn's E ring but the link to subsurface salt water was not definitive.
SNT.268775.12676	The new paper analyzes three Enceladus flybys in 2008 and 2009 with the same instrument, focusing on the composition of freshly ejected plume grains.
SNT.268775.12677	In 2008, Cassini discovered a high "density of volatile gases, water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as organic materials, some 20 times denser than expected" in geysers erupting from the moon.
SNT.268775.12678	The icy particles hit the detector target at speeds between 15,000 and 39,000 MPH (23,000 and 63,000 KPH), vaporizing instantly.
SNT.268775.12679	Electrical fields inside the cosmic dust analyzer separated the various constituents of the impact cloud.
SNT.268775.12680	"Enceladus has got warmth, water and organic chemicals, some of the essential building blocks needed for life," said Dennis Matson in 2008, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
SNT.268775.12681	"This finding is a crucial new piece of evidence showing that environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life can be sustained on icy bodies orbiting gas giant planets," said Nicolas Altobelli, the European Space Agency's project scientist for Cassini.
SNT.268775.12682	"If there is water in such an unexpected place, it leaves possibility for the rest of the universe," said Postberg.
SNT.54100.12683	A Palestinian teenager was killed and seven others, including six children, injured in an Israeli airstrike near a school in the town of Beit Lahiya, according to Dr. Muawiya Hassanin, a local emergency services official.
SNT.54100.12684	Israeli military officials said that the strike targeted militants who were retrieving a device used to fire missiles.
SNT.54100.12685	Israel's incursions into northern Gaza, which are aimed at curbing rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, have killed over 50 people over the last six days.
SNT.54100.12686	Friday saw 17 killings, including the gunning down of two women outside a mosque in Beit Hanoun.
SNT.54100.12687	At least seven people, including a 12-year-old girl were killed by Israeli action on Saturday, and three others yesterday.
SNT.54100.12688	The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert denied that his country was planning to re-occupy Gaza, and said that the offensive is aimed at stopping rockets from being fired into Israel by Hamas militants.
SNT.54100.12689	Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has termed the incidents "massacres" and has called for the UN Security Council to discuss the issue.
SNT.54100.12690	Israeli troops have regularly made incursions into Gaza following the capture of Gilad Shalit in June this year.
SNT.84926.12691	Ron Cahill, a Canberra resident and chief coroner of the Australian Capital Territory, has concluded the inquest into the deaths of three Australian nationals who were amongst the 21 people killed in the crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200.
SNT.84926.12692	The Boeing 737-400 aircraft overshot a runway at Yogyakarta, Indonesia on March 7.
SNT.84926.12693	The inquest indicated that Alison Sudradjat, Brice Steele and Mark Scott died from injuries sustained in the crash.
SNT.84926.12694	Cahill commented that this finding would also apply to the deaths of two other Australians on the flight; the remaining fatal injuries were sustained by Indonesians.
SNT.84926.12695	The inquest was opened at the request of families of the three victims involved in this inquest after the repatriation of their bodies.
SNT.84926.12696	Cahill agreed fully with a recent report issued by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, which indicated that the pilot-in-command attempted to land the aircraft at extreme speed despite 15 automated cockpit warnings and a request from the co-pilot to perform a go-around.
SNT.84926.12697	He went on to suggest that the pilot should be prosecuted over his mistakes.
SNT.84926.12698	"I recommend that CASA and Air Services Australia and all Australian airlines review the report to consider whether any of the safety deficiencies identified have relevance to Australian aviation operations and therefore need to be addressed," he said.
SNT.84926.12699	He went on to describe concerns with how these deficiencies are being addressed in Indonesia: "It is of some concern that the Indonesian regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, did not provide the National Transportation Safety Committee with details of safety action to address the recommendations which were in the draft report."
SNT.84926.12700	Alison Sudrajat's daughter had this to say in light of the findings: "It was very informative and it was nice to know what exactly happened, because he went into quite some detail about everything."
SNT.84926.12701	"It was quite comforting, but it's not going to bring anyone back."
SNT.84703.12702	The opening ceremonies for the 2007 Baseball World Cup (2007 BWC) were held Tuesday.
SNT.84703.12703	Torrential rain, however, made Panama vs Spain the opening match of the 2007 BWC in Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium.
SNT.84703.12704	The original opening match of Chinese Taipei vs Italy was postponed until next week and will be played at Tianmu Baseball Stadium.
SNT.84703.12705	"Recently, we got into a sticky situation while constructing a dome due to some protests by non-governmental people, but we'll try to overcome these difficulties in order to present high-level sports to the international market."
SNT.84703.12706	Chin-chi Wu, the Director of the Taipei City Bureau of Education, remarked at Tuesday's opening ceremony.
SNT.62010.12707	There are at least two big winners in Tuesday night's US$370 million Mega Millions lottery drawing which is held in 12 U.S. states.
SNT.62010.12708	The two winning tickets were sold in Georgia and New Jersey, but lottery officials say that no one has come forward to claim their millions.
SNT.62010.12709	One ticket was sold at a store called Campark Liquors, which is located in Woodbine, New Jersey.
SNT.62010.12710	The other ticket was sold at what is called the Favorite Market, located in Dalton, Georgia.
SNT.62010.12711	The drawing, the biggest in Mega Millions history, was moved from its usual location in Atlanta, Georgia to Times Square, New York because at one point, according to New York's lottery commissioner, Robert McLaughlin, at least 1,000,000 tickets an hour were being sold in the state of New York.
SNT.62010.12712	In fact, the state's lottery system, for reasons still not known, went off-line at 10:25 p.m., just over a half hour before the drawing was to be held.
SNT.62010.12713	At least one person was one number away from winning the jackpot, matching five of the six numbers.
SNT.62010.12714	That ticket is worth $250,000 and was bought at Burtonsville Crown Beer & Wine in Montgomery County, Maryland.
SNT.62010.12715	The previous record for the highest multi-state lottery was set back in 2006 when the Power Ball jackpot paid out at least $365 million dollars to eight people in Nebraska.
SNT.62010.12716	Another multi-state lottery, The Big Game (which was later named Mega Millions) has the third highest jackpot of $363 million dollars which was paid out in 2000.
SNT.227272.12717	A huge fire at a Chilean prison in San Miguel has killed at least 81 inmates, and injured another 14, including a firefighter and three gendarmerie officers, the Chilean Health Minister Jaime Mañalich reported.
SNT.227272.12718	The fire is considered the worst accident in the country's jail history.
SNT.227272.12719	Fifteen corpses have been identified, Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter reported.
SNT.105517.12720	Aid from the United Nations has started to reach Myanmar after a recent cyclone in the region killed tens of thousands.
SNT.105517.12721	The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon released a statement regarding the delivery of aid to Myanmar:
SNT.105517.12722	Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.
SNT.105517.12723	Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred.
SNT.105517.12724	At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.
SNT.105517.12725	The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.
SNT.735697.12726	Lawyers representing Haitian cholera victims warned the United Nations (UN) on May 7, if they do not admit liability for the spread of cholera in 2010, they'll be sued.
SNT.735697.12727	Lawyers demand the UN apologize to and compensate the victims and improve sanitation efforts.
SNT.735697.12728	Lawyers claim the UN is breaking international law by failing to apologize or provide remuneration to the victims.
SNT.735697.12729	They're seeking a minimum of USD$100,000 each for families of the deceased and $50,000 for each survivor.
SNT.735697.12730	So far, over 8,000 people have died and thousands more have been infected with the disease.
SNT.735697.12731	UN peacekeepers, whom arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, are being blamed for the spread of the disease which started near the troop's encampment.
SNT.735697.12732	According to the lawsuit, waste from the UN camp was not properly sanitized, causing bacteria to enter the tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest.
SNT.735697.12733	Prior to the arrival of troops, Haiti had not encountered problems related to the disease since the 1800s.
SNT.735697.12734	The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy has referenced independent studies that suggest the Nepalese UN peacekeeping battalion unknowingly brought the disease to Haiti.
SNT.735697.12735	Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, stated the outbreak was likely caused by the peacekeepers.
SNT.735697.12736	Scientists from Pacific Bio-sciences of California Inc. analyzed the bacteria in Haiti and concluded its genome is an almost identical match to samples recovered in South Asia, but different to those found in Latin America.
SNT.735697.12737	The UN continues to deny any responsibility for the cholera outbreak and claims it is immune from further legal proceedings.
SNT.84520.12738	Every year around November 5th, people in Great Britain and some parts of the Commonwealth celebrate Guy Fawkes night to commemorate the dissident from York and his Roman Catholic conspirators who failed to blow up the houses of Parliament on November 5, 1605.
SNT.84520.12739	This so-called Gunpowder Plot is celebrated with firework displays and sparklers, bonfires and Guy Fawkes effigies.
SNT.84520.12740	Fire experts, always busy around this time of year, have called for the use of safe and legal firework displays and have urged citizens to attend organised public displays.
SNT.84520.12741	Every year dozens of people sustain injuries due to careless handling of fireworks or fires.
SNT.84520.12742	Notably, the city of York is not having a public firework display this year, as health and safety measures would raise costs excessively.
SNT.84520.12743	Events in Lewes, East Sussex (noted for Bonfire events and processions) were for the most part peacful, with only 16 arrests, mainly for public order offences.
SNT.84520.12744	There had however been calls for certain tradtions of the Lewes events to be banned prior to the event on safety grounds.
SNT.84520.12745	Critics say that bonfires and fireworks are not environmentally friendly.
SNT.84520.12746	Piles of wood prepared beforehand are attractive nests for hibernating creatures like hedgehogs, who might burn in the bonfires.
SNT.84520.12747	Some even suggest that Fawkes' failed attack is not something to commemorate at all.
SNT.11162.12748	There are often odd, unusual and controversial items up for sale on eBay - multi-million euro planes, the Pope's old car and a young woman's virginity, to name just a few.
SNT.11162.12749	Shoes custom designed for former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have been put up for sale on eBay.
SNT.11162.12750	The shoes, which have a reserve price of £2,930 (US $3,580), are currently owned by 65 year old Eleanor Graham.
SNT.11162.12751	Ms. Graham bought them in a Sue Ryder charity shop after seeing a member of Thatcher's staff drop them in the shop.
SNT.11162.12752	She guessed that they would increase in value over the years, so Ms. Graham purchased them.
SNT.11162.12753	The Rayne shoes - which come in gold, silver and black suede - are size five and come with a letter received in 2001 from Ms Thatchers office confirming that she did wear Rayne shoes.
SNT.11162.12754	You can see the shoes at eBay by clicking here.
SNT.54466.12755	Jack Palance, best known for his role as Curly in the 1991 film, "City Slickers", died of natural causes on Friday, November 10, at the age of 87.
SNT.54466.12756	He died in Montecito, California, surrounded by family, according to spokesman Dick Guttman.
SNT.54466.12757	Palance is survived by his second wife, Elaine Rogers Palance; his daughter, Holly; another daughter, Brook Palance Wilding; grandchildren Lily and Spencer Spottiswoode and Tarquin Wilding; his brother, John Palance, and sister Anne Despiva.
SNT.54466.12758	A memorial service for him is planned for December 16.
SNT.54466.12759	He also played the role of the Oscar- nominated Jack Wilson in "Shane".
SNT.33029.12760	A massive demonstration march on Thursday of over half a million Shiite Muslims in Beirut, Lebanon heard Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, tell the U.S. President George W. Bush and his Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to "shut up" after they reportedly accused Iran and Syria of fueling protest demonstrations over the Muhammad cartoons.
SNT.33029.12761	Let Condoleezza Rice and Bush and all the tyrants shut up.
SNT.33029.12762	We are an Islamic nation that cannot tolerate, be silent or be lax when they insult our prophet and sanctities.
SNT.33029.12763	We will uphold the messenger of God not only by our voices but also by our blood," Nasrallah told the crowd, estimated to be 700,000 (police said the figure was likely to be even higher).
SNT.33029.12764	The Hezbollah leader also told the crowd that protests must continue until laws are passed in Europe banning insults to Muhammad.
SNT.33029.12765	NATO defence ministers are in Brussels meeting to discuss the controversy's security implications.
SNT.33029.12766	The upheavals of protest in Afghanistan are blamed for the deaths of 10 people in that country this week.
SNT.33029.12767	Muslim protests have spread across the Middle East, Asia and Africa.
SNT.33029.12768	Speaking Wednesday at a joint news conference in Washington with the new Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, the U.S. Secretary Rice said, "Iran and Syria have gone out of their way to inflame sentiments and to use this to their own purposes and the world ought to call them on it."
SNT.33029.12769	Her comments were preceded earlier that day President Bush who also called for an end to the violence: "I call upon the governments around the world to stop the violence.
SNT.33029.12770	To protect the lives of innocent diplomats who are serving their countries overseas."
SNT.153782.12771	American Alpine ski racer James Heuga has died at the age of 66.
SNT.153782.12772	Heuga won a bronze medal at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck.
SNT.153782.12773	Richard Rokos, a coach who helped Heuga with his training in his later years commented on his death.
SNT.153782.12774	He said "He tried to do his best, and when he didn't do as well as he was hoping for, he was disappointed.
SNT.153782.12775	He couldn't walk, he couldn't run, he couldn't do anything else, but this was the way he could present himself as a competitive athlete.
SNT.153782.12776	Heuga competed for the United States at the 1964 Winter Olympics.
SNT.153782.12777	He won a bronze medal in the slalom with a time of 2.11.52.
SNT.153782.12778	Heuga, along with Billy Kidd who won silver in the same event became the first Americans to win a medal in Alpine ski racing.
SNT.153782.12779	Forced to retire early from competitive sport due to multiple sclerosis, Heuga continued to train as an athlete.
SNT.153782.12780	In 1984 he opened up the Jimmie Heuga Center to help sufferers with multiple sclerosis.
SNT.153782.12781	Billy Kidd, whom he shared the podium with at the 1964 games, said “Obviously, the world knew him for his accomplishments as a ski racer, but I admire him even more because of how he led his life, especially with the challenges of MS.”
SNT.125160.12782	Zahi Hawass, Egypt's pre-eminent archaeologist, revealed the first ancient artifacts which may lead to the discovery of Cleopatra and Marc Antony's resting place.
SNT.125160.12783	The expedition has found amulets, 22 bronze coins cast with Cleopatra's image and her name, a royal statue, an alabaster mask resembling Marc Antony, and a statue bust of Cleopatra.
SNT.125160.12784	"If you look at the face of Mark Antony, many believed he had this cleft on his chin and that's why I thought this could be Mark Antony," said Hawass.
SNT.125160.12785	"In my opinion, if this tomb is found, it will be one of the most important discoveries of the 21st century because of the love between Cleopatra and Mark Antony, and because of the sad story of their death.
SNT.125160.12786	This is the perfect place for them to be hidden," said Hawass.
SNT.125160.12787	Recently, outside the temple colourful mummies of nobles were excavated at a neighbouring necropolis.
SNT.125160.12788	These discoveries have lead the archaeologists to believe that a ruler or person of royalty is interred within the temple itself.
SNT.125160.12789	It was the practice of the Greco-Roman era to assemble the tombs of persons of status and other high ranking officials near their rulers.
SNT.125160.12790	"The discovery of the cemetery this week really convinced me that there is someone important buried inside this temple.
SNT.125160.12791	No one would be buried outside a temple without a reason.
SNT.125160.12792	We saw that in the pharaonic days, they were always buried beside pyramids," explained Hawass.
SNT.125160.12793	"She needed a place to be protected in the afterlife.
SNT.125160.12794	If she had used the other burial site, she would have disappeared forever," said Kathleen Martinez, a Dominican archaeologist.
SNT.125160.12795	She feels that "it could be Taposiris Magna because it was the most sacred temple of its time."
SNT.125160.12796	Dr. Roger Vickers team used radar to locate three chambers within the rocky hill atop of which is the Temple of Taposiris Magna dedicated to the goddess Isis.
SNT.125160.12797	The temple was constructed about 300 BC by Ptolemy II.
SNT.125160.12798	The Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) expedition led by Hawass has yet to excavate the burial chambers 40 feet (12 meters) underground where they hope to find a crown or Egyptian hieroglyph cartouches revealing the names of royalty.
SNT.125160.12799	The Supreme Council of Antiquities expedition consists of Zahi Hawass, Secretary General of the SCA, and Martinez who has extensively researched the life of Cleopatra.
SNT.125160.12800	According to Plutarch who studied Roman history, Caesar allowed Marc Antony and Cleopatra to be buried in the same tomb.
SNT.125160.12801	Alexandria is located about 30 miles (48 km) from the Temple of Taposiris Magna.
SNT.125160.12802	The archaeological site is on a hill along the Mediterranean Sea overlooking the summer home of Hosni Mubarak, president of Egypt.
SNT.125160.12803	The archaeologists fear they may have to postpone work for security reasons over the summer months.
SNT.88032.12804	Oscar Peterson, a Canadian jazz pianist who earned many honours during his decades-long career, died Sunday in Mississauga, Ontario aged 82.
SNT.88032.12805	The Montreal-born Peterson learned to play piano in childhood and by the 1940s was actively performing in Canadian big bands such as the Johnny Holmes Orchestra.
SNT.88032.12806	A groundbreaking performance at New York's Carnegie Hall in 1949 brought Peterson's career to an international level.
SNT.88032.12807	Among many honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour, in 1984.
SNT.88032.12808	He also received seven Grammy Awards and in 1978 was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.
SNT.75891.12809	Popular social networking website Facebook went down for unknown upgrades, possibly to circumvent multiple holes that were published in a white paper earlier.
SNT.75891.12810	From roughly 1:00 to 4:15 pm ET, users reported the site was down.
SNT.75891.12811	Blogs have speculated it may be simply a server upgrade, or it may be new features.
SNT.75891.12812	One web development blogger has even raised the theory that the site was hacked, with the login box showing multiple random email addresses, through "<input>" coding.
SNT.75891.12813	Another user replied to this posting, saying that they were even able to read the other, random user's inbox.
SNT.75891.12814	Both a blogger who works at a computing company's office in Johannesburg, South Africa and a Norwegian news outlet reported similar troubles.
SNT.75891.12815	Many blogs received comments from people with similar circumstances, worldwide.
SNT.75891.12816	A white paper by Adrienne Felt, posted on July 27, 2007, explained step-by-step how to use an exploit to hijack a user's account.
SNT.75891.12817	The white paper was then partially censored by the author, until the vulnerability has been fixed by Facebook.
SNT.75891.12818	Regardless of whether the change was prompted by this paper, both the XSS hole and problem with forms described by the author were fixed during the upgrade.
SNT.75891.12819	This is the first known global outage for the site.
SNT.75891.12820	This comes as a rival site, ConnectU, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea and the code.
SNT.75891.12821	Also on Wednesday, the Black Hat Briefings computer security conference begins.
SNT.75891.12822	The conference unites people from "government agencies and global corporations with the underground's most respected hackers."
SNT.202041.12823	Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella announced Sunday that he will retire from Major League Baseball after almost fifty years of coaching, managing, and playing the sport.
SNT.202041.12824	Piniella's announcement came after the Chicago Cubs lost to the Atlanta Braves 16-5 at the Cub's Wrigley Field.
SNT.202041.12825	The 66 year-old Piniella said that he was retiring because of family issues.
SNT.202041.12826	For much of the 2010 MLB season, Piniella's 90 year-old mother has been ill.
SNT.202041.12827	"This will be the last time I put on a uniform.
SNT.202041.12828	I'll go home, do what I have to do there...and enjoy my retirement," said Piniella.
SNT.202041.12829	"My mom needs me at home; she hasn't gotten any better since I've been here.
SNT.202041.12830	Rather than continue to go home, come back...It's not fair to the team, not fair to the players.
SNT.202041.12831	The best thing to do is to step down, go home and take care of my mother," he added.
SNT.202041.12832	During his 18 year career as a player, Piniella logged 1,705 hits.

SNT.123995.12835	According to police, Kile Wygle, 28, from Newark, Ohio, was arrested for drunk driving after he crashed his motorized bar stool.
SNT.123995.12836	While driving his bar stool, which is powered by a lawnmower engine, Wygle attempted to make a U-turn while going down his street and crashed.
SNT.123995.12837	Police received a call from a local resident that Wygle had been injured in the crash.
SNT.123995.12838	When police arrived, he was taken to a local hospital where police say he admitted to drinking 15 beers.
SNT.123995.12839	After being treated for minor injuries, Wygle was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.
SNT.123995.12840	Wygle pleaded not guilty when appearing in court and denies that he was drunk, but that he did begin to consume alcohol following the crash.
SNT.123995.12841	"I drank quite a bit after [the crash] because my head hurt so bad.
SNT.123995.12842	I went in and drank a half a bottle of whiskey," stated Wygle to BBC News.
SNT.123995.12843	He also requested a jury be present during his trial.
SNT.123995.12844	Wygle says his vehicle can travel nearly 40 miles per hour.
SNT.123995.12845	Police say that motorized bar stools have become popular, with residents building them and then racing them.
SNT.123995.12846	Most are made from old lawnmower parts, a steering wheel and a bar stool.
SNT.4956.12847	The largest multiplex cinema complex in Southeastern Europe opened on Friday in Bucharest, the capital of Romania.
SNT.4956.12848	The cinema is operated by Movieplex Italy and is located in the Plaza Romania shopping centre.
SNT.4956.12849	Robert Longhi, the general manager of Movieplex, said that the value of the investment reached 4.7 million euro.
SNT.4956.12850	It is estimated that, during the first year of activity, the cinema will attract one million customers.
SNT.4956.12851	Plaza Romania is one of the newest shopping centres in Bucharest, having opened in October 2004 after a 45 million euro investment by Anchor Group, a Turkish company, which also invested in the Bucharest Mall, another large shopping centre in the Romanian capital.
SNT.107895.12852	Police in Indonesia have forwarded a 200-page brief concerning the Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 disaster to prosecutors.
SNT.107895.12853	The move comes as an indication that the trial of pilot-in-command Captain Marwoto Komar is set to commence within weeks.
SNT.107895.12854	The March 7, 2007 crash of a Boeing 737-400 at Yogyakarta International Airport killed 21 people.
SNT.107895.12855	119 others were able to escape the burning wreckage after the plane overshot the runway, going through the perimeter fence and crossing a road and an embankment to come to rest in a paddy field.
SNT.107895.12856	Most of the deceased were Indonesians, with five from neighbouring Australia also killed.
SNT.107895.12857	A final report was later issued after an investigation by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) in October 2007.
SNT.107895.12858	The report blamed pilot error for the crash, finding that the airliner had touched down at roughly twice the accepted safe landing speed, and that Komar was "fixated" on landing and "probably emotionally aroused".
SNT.107895.12859	The Cockpit Voice Recorder indicated that he ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System and a call from his co-pilot for a 'go-around' as the plane touched down.
SNT.107895.12860	A number of other criticisms were also leveled at the airport, the airline and transport politicians for contributing factors.
SNT.107895.12861	Komar is to be prosecuted over the crash for negligence.
SNT.107895.12862	His earlier arrest - which he was subsequently released from pending full charges - sparked protests from Indonesian aviation groups and criticism from international groups, including IFALPA, a powerful international airline pilots' association.
SNT.107895.12863	Evidence in his trial is set to include documentational evidence and aircraft wreckage, but it is unclear whether it will include the NTSC report.
SNT.107895.12864	Much controversy was caused by the suggestion it may be used, since international regulations limit the use of materials intended for safety investigations as evidence to prove liability in criminal or civil cases.
SNT.107895.12865	Kamal Firdaus, council for the pilot, explained what this means for his client: "Today the documentation has been officially accepted by the prosecutor," adding, "I suspect from this it will be two to three weeks until it is handed over to the court - that's the usual practice.
SNT.107895.12866	Firdaus commented that it would be "difficult" for liability to be established and that, "we are ready and it will be a very interesting legal case, so let's see what will happen in the court."
SNT.107895.12867	Komar, 45, is believed to be the first pilot prosecuted over an air accident in Indonesia despite the country's poor aviation safety record.
SNT.107895.12868	He is being charged with three counts of negligence, but the potential sentence is unclear, as Aero-News reports that he could face life imprisonment while The Age says he can face up to seven years' imprisonment.
SNT.107895.12869	His case is considered a landmark, with aviation groups believing his trial may set the precedent for pilots involved in future accidents.
SNT.50204.12870	Colombian authorities rescued a 2-month-old baby, who was kidnapped by a woman on Monday in Bogotá, in Armenia on Thursday night, September 14.
SNT.50204.12871	The baby girl, Maribel Muñoz, was taken by a woman who told her parents, Zenaida Muñoz and Henry López Romero that she belonged to an NGO and could get medical care for the girl inside Hotel Tequendama.
SNT.50204.12872	The parents, who are displaced people, went to Caracol TV network in order to report the kidnapping.
SNT.50204.12873	Surveillance recordings from the hotel and the city's bus terminal helped with the search.
SNT.50204.12874	The woman, described as in her late twenties, of height 1.65 m, and having black hair and almond-shaped eyes, left the hotel with two men and went to the local bus terminal.

SNT.50204.12878	The doctors found the baby to be in good health.
SNT.50204.12879	Maribel's parents, who live in a modest house in Usme, south Bogotá, recognized the baby on Friday early morning, thanks to a digital picture sent from Armenia to the police in Bogotá.
SNT.50204.12880	The child was returned to her parents at 11:30 a.m. (16:30 UTC) on Friday.
SNT.142236.12881	US president Barack Obama declared a swine flu emergency in the country on Saturday, according to a statement released by the White House.
SNT.142236.12882	Obama signed a declaration late on Friday, authorising health secretary Kathleen Sebelius to bypass some federal rules, in order to let health officials respond more efficiently to the outbreak of the H1N1 virus.
SNT.142236.12883	The move is aimed at making it less difficult for people affected by the virus to seek treatment, and allow medical providers to give it immediately, bypassing potential hurdles such as health privacy regulations.
SNT.142236.12884	"As a nation, we have prepared at all levels of government, and as individuals and communities, taking unprecedented steps to counter the emerging pandemic," the president wrote in the declaration.
SNT.142236.12885	Swine flu has now been circulated in 46 of the 50 US states, and has resulted in at least 411 confirmed deaths since the end of August.
SNT.142236.12886	Production of antiviral vaccines has been slower than initially predicted, and it is likely that the US government's targets for delivery won't be met by drug makers, according to Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
SNT.16671.12887	Windsor Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom's official residences, is to get a hydro-electric power scheme.
SNT.16671.12888	The £1 million project will consist of a series of under-water turbines to be installed at Romney Weir in the nearby River Thames.
SNT.16671.12889	The system will generate 200kW, enough to meet approximately one third of the castle's electricity needs.
SNT.16671.12890	The electricity from the four turbines will not be sold into the local electricity grid, but will instead be directly connected to Windsor Castle's electrical system.
SNT.16671.12891	It will save 600 tonnes of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere every year.
SNT.16671.12892	The scheme was announced after it gained planning permission from the local council, the plans having been submitted in February of last year.
SNT.16671.12893	A feasibility study will now be conducted, with construction scheduled to start next year.
SNT.16671.12894	The Windsor Castle is not the only environmentally-friendly Royal scheme.
SNT.16671.12895	A borehole beneath Buckingham Palace provides cold water for air-conditioning and the Duke of Edinburgh's taxi runs on liquid petroleum gas.
SNT.98354.12896	On Friday, twin attacks in Iraq killed at least 72 people and wounded another 149.
SNT.98354.12897	Separated by twenty minutes, the bombings targeted two marketplaces in Baghdad shortly before the call to Friday prayers.
SNT.98354.12898	These attacks were unlike suicide bombings in that the bombs were dynamite and ball bearings strapped to two women.
SNT.98354.12899	These human bombs were then detonated remotely using mobile phone.
SNT.98354.12900	Major-General Qassim Moussawi, spokesman for the Iraqi military in Baghdad said, "The operation was carried out by two booby-trapped mentally disabled women."
SNT.98354.12901	He did not explain how the forensic evidence could have proven the mental disability of the women.
SNT.98354.12902	"We found the mobiles used to detonate the women," he said.
SNT.98354.12903	Moussawi said this of the investigation: "Forensic and bomb squad experts as well as the people and traders of al-Shorja area of the carpet market have confirmed that the woman who was blown-up there today was often in the area and was mentally disabled...
SNT.98354.12904	In the New Baghdad area the shop owners and customers of the pet market confirmed that the woman who was blown-up there was mentally disabled as well."
SNT.98354.12905	An aide to Moussawi suggested the claims were based on eye-witness reports.
SNT.98354.12906	He also said authorities believe the women were unaware of plans to detonate the explosives.
SNT.98354.12907	Lt. Col. Steve Stover, a spokesman for the multinational force in Baghdad, said, "By targeting innocent Iraqis, they show their true demonic character.
SNT.98354.12908	They care nothing for the Iraqi people; they want to subjugate them and forcefully create a greater Islamic sharia state."
SNT.98354.12909	Later, Stover told Reuters that the U.S. military was not aware of evidence to suggest the women were mentally handicapped.
SNT.98354.12910	Pentagon reports on the attacks also lacked any reference to the mental condition of the women.
SNT.98354.12911	"There is nothing they won't do if they think it will work in creating carnage and the political fallout that comes from that," the U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said.
SNT.98354.12912	U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the bombings underlined "the absolute bankruptcy and brutality" of those who carried them out.
SNT.98354.12913	"The Iraqi people have been right to turn against these terrible, violent people in their midst who will do anything."
SNT.98354.12914	Forty-five were killed at the Ghazl pet market, and 27 were killed in New Baghdad.
SNT.98354.12915	The Ghazl market is only open on Fridays and had remained popular despite two attacks in 2007.
SNT.98354.12916	"Most people who visit this market are poor and just want to enjoy themselves but they came and got killed," said Hassan Salman, who sells bird seed at the Ghazl market.

SNT.27646.12926	Officials in the Bush administration privately threatened the organizers of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Montreal, saying that any chance there might have been for the United States to sign the Kyoto Protocol would be lost if Bill Clinton spoke Friday at the meeting.
SNT.27646.12927	The threat was received within minutes of the Associated Press running a story on Clinton being added to the program.
SNT.27646.12928	"It came through loud and clear from the Bush people—they wouldn't sign the deal if Clinton were allowed to speak."
SNT.27646.12929	Clinton said, "There's no way that I'm gonna let petty politics get in the way of the deal.
SNT.27646.12930	The organizers later reported that they had "called the administration's bluff."

SNT.768597.13017	In total, officials report 181 people were hospitalized and one person remains unaccounted for.
SNT.768597.13018	It is reported that when the airplane took off from Seoul, smoke was coming from the airplane.
SNT.768597.13019	The weather was good as the plane was landing in San Francisco.
SNT.768597.13020	According to David Eun, a passenger on the airplane and the executive vice president of Samsung, the tail came off of the plane upon landing.
SNT.768597.13021	A non-passenger witness, Anthony Castorani, has reported that a fireball formed upon the plane landing and that the plane flipped over.
SNT.768597.13022	A large portion of the passenger area of the plane was on fire and has burned out.
SNT.768597.13023	Passengers were seen using emergency slides to escape the wreckage.
SNT.768597.13024	There have been no reports stating that the airplane pilot made distress calls before the accident.
SNT.768597.13025	Law enforcement does not believe the accident was the result of terrorism or criminal activity.
SNT.768597.13026	The National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating the crash.
SNT.768597.13027	The airport was closed to all incoming and outgoing air and vehicle traffic until 3:30 PM local time, when it opened 2 runways.
SNT.768597.13028	More than 70 flights headed to San Francisco were not allowed to land at the airport and were sent to other cities.
SNT.768597.13029	Some flights have been diverted to Sacramento International Airport and Delta Air Lines has canceled 10 flights to and from San Francisco.
SNT.768597.13030	United Airlines and Virgin America offered passengers the opportunity to change the flights at no extra cost until Monday.
SNT.768597.13031	Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook Chief Operating Officer, was supposed to travel on the Asiana flight.
SNT.768597.13032	She rescheduled, along with colleagues, her flight to fly on United Airlines instead.
SNT.768597.13033	A Boeing 777 can hold as many as 300 passengers.
SNT.1203.13034	Romania's ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) has emerged ahead in yesterday's legislative and presidential elections.
SNT.1203.13035	The voter turnout was around 57% of all eligible voters, which number 18 million people in a country of 21.7 million.
SNT.1203.13036	However the PSD did not gain the vote majority needed to declare an outright victory, and it will now proceed to a run-off election against the centre-left opposition.
SNT.1203.13037	Called the Truth and Justice Alliance, the main opposition is a union of candidates from the National Liberal Party and the Democrat Party.
SNT.1203.13038	While PSD+PUR is currently leading, the most hotly-contested election in Romania's post-Communist history may come down to the run-off, to be held on December 12.
SNT.1203.13039	The winning presidential candidate of the run-off will not only become the country's president but will also appoint a prime minister to lead the government.
SNT.1203.13040	In the presidential election, Adrian Năstase, the PSD's presidential candidate, won approximately 42% of the vote, while Traian Băsescu of Truth and Justice obtained around 35%, according to exit polls.
SNT.1203.13041	Năstase led the exit polls due to greater support in rural Romania, as well as support from the urban poor, due to his policy of boosting the economy.
SNT.1203.13042	Năstase's PSD+PUR coalition was also supported because they are credited with saving Romania from economic collapse during their presidential and legislative term from 2000 until the present time.
SNT.1203.13043	During his term of prime-minister of Romania, from 2000 to 2004, Năstase not only boosted the economy but ensured that Romania entered NATO and progressed towards its accession to the European Union, expected to occur in 2007.
SNT.1203.13044	In 2004, the economy is expected to grow by 8.6%, the highest rate in Europe.
SNT.1203.13045	Băsescu won a majority in Bucharest, Romania's capital, as well as in the wealthier cities of Transylvania.
SNT.1203.13046	Băsescu is supported by the educated middle-class, who take a favourable view upon his policy of stamping out corruption in one of the region's most corrupt countries.
SNT.1203.13047	Băsescu has also received a boost due to his liberalist policies and his proposal for tax reform and the introduction of a flat tax.
SNT.1203.13048	In the legislative election, the PSD+PUR coalition obtained 40% of the vote, while the Truth and Justice alliance trailed with 35%.
SNT.1203.13049	Because the PSD+PUR coalition did not gather the majority of the votes (50%+1), it will have to form a governing coalition with the minor parties, a process which is expected to be tedious given the fact that both of the major parties have ruled out entering into a coalition with ultra-nationalist The Greater Romania Party, which obtained around 12% of the vote.
SNT.143104.13050	A 23-year-old pedestrian walking along Racecourse Road in the city of Londonderry, Northern Ireland at around 0220 GMT on Sunday night was struck by a black Volkswagen Passat and has been killed.
SNT.143104.13051	A 22-year-old man has now been arrested by the police and taken away for questioning, so as to assist police with their enquiries.
SNT.143104.13052	The road was closed so that investigations could be carried out but has since been reopened.
SNT.143104.13053	The Police Service of Northern Ireland are asking any witnesses to contact them as soon as possible.
SNT.143104.13054	Also, another accident was reported which took place in Newtownhamilton, County Armagh in which two 17 year old boys were involved.
SNT.143104.13055	One of them is severely ill while the other has been discharged from the hospital.
SNT.57292.13056	United States Food and Drug Administration announced that cloned meat and milk from specific animals was "...as safe as the food we eat every day."
SNT.57292.13057	An FDA spokesperson also added that there where "No unique risks for human food consumption...".
SNT.57292.13058	Coming after a lengthy study, the move is likely to meet with opposition from U.S. consumers, despite the final decision having still to be made.
SNT.57292.13059	Carol Foreman, a spokesperson for the Consumer Federation, was quoted as calling the move "a very bad decision".
SNT.186935.13060	A motorist was injured during a collision that resulted in a rollover in the city of Naperville, Illinois, United States.
SNT.186935.13061	The accident occurred at about 8:15 am (13:15 UTC) on the interchange of Illinois Route 59 and Interstate 88.
SNT.186935.13062	Naperville police reported that Pavitra Durgam, a 26-year-old from Chicago, was traveling southbound on Route 59 and tried to turn left onto the ramp to Interstate 88.
SNT.186935.13063	In doing so, she cut in front of a car heading north on Route 59.
SNT.186935.13064	The other, currently unidentified driver swerved to avoid her, hit a curb, and collided with her car anyway. 
SNT.186935.13065	Northbound traffic on Route 59 north of Diehl Road, including the entrance into eastbound Interstate 88, was blocked as crews cleaned up the area of the collision.
SNT.186935.13066	The unidentified motorist complained of back pain and was thus sent to nearby Edward Hospital.
SNT.186935.13067	Durgam received a citation for failing to yield to oncoming traffic as she turned. 
SNT.257407.13068	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actively pushed for a military strike on Iran, according to a report published in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Thursday.
SNT.257407.13069	A document revealed by Wikileaks, dated July 20, 2007, shows that Mr. Netanyahu, leader of the Likud party, urged an attack on Iran in exchange for joining the government at the time, led by Ehud Olmert.
SNT.257407.13070	Mr. Netanyahu's request was made as part of discussions to form a government of national unity between Likud and Mr. Olmert's Kadima party, according to the leaked cable, classified as "confidential" and penned by Marc.J. Sievers, who was at the US embassy in Tel Aviv as a political counselor.
SNT.257407.13072	An advisor to Mr. Netanyahu told American officials at the time that the Likud leader was willing to take the post of foreign minister, while Mr. Olmert would have become prime minister.
SNT.257407.13073	However, Mr. Netanyahu demanded military action against Iran as the price for his participation in the proposed coalition.
SNT.257407.13074	According to the advisor cited in the US cable, Mr. Netanyahu urged the Kadima leader to "galvanize Israel for action against Iran."
SNT.257407.13075	Israel has previously entertained the possibility of military strikes to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear weapons capability.
SNT.257407.13076	In November 2010, Iran announced uranium enrichment activities had been disrupted by the Stuxnet computer virus.
SNT.257407.13077	The Iranian government later accused the US and Israel of responsibility for the malware.
SNT.257407.13078	Israel and Western powers have accused Iran, whose president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has called for Israel to be "wiped off the map," of seeking to obtain nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear program.
SNT.143568.13079	The government of Saudi Arabia removed an eleven-year ban on livestock imports from Somalia after fears of Rift Valley Fever were allayed, senior Somali officials said on Thursday.
SNT.143568.13080	The decision was well received across Somalia, as hundreds of thousands of farmers heavily rely on animal exports to the oil-rich Middle East.
SNT.143568.13081	Under the new arrangement, Saudi officials will closely examine animals before they are shipped off to Saudi soil.
SNT.143568.13082	"This is a tremendous decision for Somalis across the Horn of Africa," said Idiris Ibrahim Abdi, the livestock minister of Somaliland, the self-declared republic in northern Somalia, which has developed one of the most sophisticated animal processing plants in its port town of Berbera.
SNT.143568.13083	According to news accounts, the Saudi agricultural ministry said the decision is based on years of cross-examination and monitoring of animal farms in Somalia.
SNT.143568.13084	Animal trade is one of the few surviving economic engines of Somalia's largely destroyed economy.
SNT.143568.13085	Business leaders and animal farmers have largely welcomed the Saudi decision.
SNT.62298.13086	The National Hockey League (NHL) has handed down a season-long suspension, including the playoffs, to Chris Simon of the New York Islanders.
SNT.62298.13087	The suspension, for a minimum of 25 games, is a ruling for a hit Simon laid on Ryan Hollweg of the New York Rangers during a March 8 game at Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum.
SNT.62298.13088	In a press release earlier today, the NHL indicated that they considered Simon's hit on Hollweg, with a stick to the face, to be a deliberate intent to injure.
SNT.62298.13089	"The National Hockey League will not accept the use of a stick in the manner and fashion in which Mr. Simon used his Thursday night," said Colin Campbell, NHL Senior Executive Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations.
SNT.62298.13090	After receiving a hard check from Hollweg, Simon swung his stick and delivered a two-handed blow to Hollweg's upper body, causing a cut on Hollweg's chin.
SNT.62298.13091	Based on his $1-million contract, which expires at the conclusion of the 2006-07 season, Simon forfeits a minimum of $80,213.90.
SNT.62298.13092	The suspension could carry over into the 2007-2008 hockey season, depending on how far the Islanders advance into the playoffs.
SNT.62298.13093	According to the NHL press release, if the Islanders do not qualify for the 2007 playoffs, or play fewer than 10 playoff games in the 2007 playoffs, Simon would serve additional games at the start of the 2007-08 regular season to satisfy the minimum term of the suspension.
SNT.62298.13094	Garth Snow, General Manager of the Islanders, indicated his support for Simon in a brief press release.
SNT.62298.13095	"I spoke with Colin Campbell this morning and he informed me of his decision.
SNT.62298.13096	Chris Simon has played a major role in our success this season and we will miss his presence in our lineup.
SNT.62298.13097	His regret is clearly evident in the statement he released last night.
SNT.62298.13098	Our entire organization supports Chris every step of the way."
SNT.62298.13099	In a statement March 10, prior to the verdict, Simon expressed regret for his actions.
SNT.62298.13100	"After watching the tape the morning after Thursday's game, I was disgusted.
SNT.62298.13101	There is absolutely no place in hockey for what I did.
SNT.62298.13102	I was grateful to learn that Ryan is okay and that he returned to the game.
SNT.62298.13103	My hope is to reach out to him in the near future."
SNT.62298.13104	Simon explains that his behavior may have been influenced by a hit he received less than a minute before his stick swinging incident.
SNT.62298.13105	When I saw the tape on Friday morning, it explained a lot to me when I saw the look on my face after being hit into the boards.
SNT.62298.13106	Simon didn't appear to let it excuse his hit on Hollweg.
SNT.62298.13107	"I need to make clear that this is not justification for the danger I put Ryan Hollweg in and the damage I have caused the game.
SNT.62298.13108	The Associated Press indicated that criminal charges against Simon are being considered.
SNT.62298.13109	According to a spokesperson for Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice, "no decision has been reached" on bringing charges, but that "prosecutors would review the tape."
SNT.131531.13110	Astronomers have discovered an extrasolar planet that may eventually collide into its sun.
SNT.131531.13111	The planet, called WASP-18b, orbits its star in under one day, and is 10 times larger than Jupiter.
SNT.131531.13112	The planet's name is derived from the group that discovered it, WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets).
SNT.131531.13113	Tidal interactions between the planet and its star are pulling them together, and it will likely crash into its star in under one million years.
SNT.131531.13114	The planet is relatively much closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun.
SNT.131531.13115	Earth is a distance of 93 million miles from the sun, whereas WASP-18b is only 1.4 million miles from its star.
SNT.131531.13116	Professor Andrew Collier Cameron of St. Andrew's University commented on the inherent problems with the planet: "The problem with this planet is that it's very massive and very close to its star."
SNT.131531.13117	"It should be creating tidal bulging that makes it spiral into its star."
SNT.131531.13118	Coel Hellier of Keele University led a group of researchers that discovered the planet.
SNT.131531.13119	Their study of WASP-18b was published in the August 27 issue of the journal Nature.
SNT.131531.13120	Scientists had a 1 in 2,000 chance of discovering the planet.
SNT.131531.13121	There are 300 planets which are known to orbit stars other than the Sun.
SNT.8006.13122	The military reported that after taking the youth to an isolated area they searched him and found another four explosives.
SNT.8006.13123	The Hawara checkpoint has seen this kind of trouble before.
SNT.8006.13124	In April 2004, soldiers there arrested a 16-year-old, also Palestinian, with a suicide bomb strapped to his body.
SNT.8006.13125	The teenager, Hussam Abdo, later told an Israeli newspaper he was on a mission to kill Israeli soldiers.
SNT.8006.13126	Israeli radio noted that this is the third Palestinian child in the past two months caught attempting to transfer explosives past Israeli checkpoints.
SNT.116620.13127	Raouf Amin el-Araby, a 52-year-old Egyptian doctor who has been serving the Saudi Royal family for 20 years, was convicted of malpractice.
SNT.116620.13128	Egyptian newspapers reported that he was accused of driving a Saudi princess "to addiction", reportedly after treating a Saudi princess with painkillers.
SNT.116620.13129	Initially sentenced to 7 years and 700 lashes, he has been sentenced to 15 years and 1500 lashes, 70 a week, after making an appeal.
SNT.116620.13130	Family members, friends and colleagues gathered in outrage and grief outside the headquarters of Egypt's doctors union, calling upon King Abdullah to pardon Raouf.
SNT.116620.13131	"1,500 lashes is unprecedented in the history of Islam," read one banner carried by protesters.
SNT.116620.13132	"Who is responsible for the humiliation of our doctors abroad?" read another.
SNT.116620.13133	The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the foreign minister are working hard to find a way to return Raouf home quickly.
SNT.116620.13134	Hafez Abu Saeda, the director of EOHR, stated that the princess was prescribed the same medication that she was receiving in the United States, "so it is obvious that the doctor was not at fault for her addiction."
SNT.116620.13135	Protests in Egypt have driven the Egyptian foreign ministry to seek a solution, partly out of concern that negative repercussions may damage relations between Cairo and Riyadh.
SNT.116620.13136	A human rights lawyer said that he was given the first 70 lashes last week and he will get 70 more this week.
SNT.33276.13137	Several thousand Muslims protested today in Paris, France, as well as the eastern city of Strasbourg, against the publication of caricatures of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper and the re-publication of some of these caricatures in French newspapers: the daily France Soir and the weekly Charlie Hebdo.
SNT.33276.13138	The protesters consider that these caricatures insulted their prophet, and thus, they contend, their religion and themselves.
SNT.33276.13139	Charlie Hebdo is a weekly paper known for its extremely acerbic positions against organized religion; it often mocks Catholicism, the largest religious denomination in France.
SNT.33276.13140	Some banners claimed that freedom of speech should not imply the possibility of insulting religious figures.
SNT.33276.13141	Other banners claimed that French society was applying dual standards.
SNT.33276.13142	Some protesters demanded a law against "islamophobia"; France does not have blasphemy laws and has a tradition of anticlericalism.
SNT.33276.13143	Many of the female protesters wore a scarf to hide their hair, and some wore a hijab or veil.
SNT.33276.13144	The French government enacted a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in government-operated schools, a move widely considered to be targeting the veil and scarf, which many consider a sign of subordination of females.
SNT.33276.13145	The protest was followed at a distance by a large complement of CRS and other police forces.
SNT.83139.13146	Libertarianz party president, Craig Milmine, and the party leader, Bernard Darnton, spoke exclusively to Wikinews journalist Gabriel Pollard about the political philosophy, libertarianism in New Zealand.
SNT.83139.13147	This article follows on from interviews with republican, Lewis Holden; and monarchist, Noel Cox.
SNT.83139.13148	The idea of libertarianism is where consent is required for all actions between people, and that these interactions are voluntary.
SNT.83139.13149	Over four million people will be given freedom to run their own lives as Mr Milmine said.
SNT.83139.13150	He says the Government doesn't follow this generally accepted principle.
SNT.83139.13151	"They take money without consent, order us around, and tell us what we can and cannot put in our bodies."
SNT.83139.13152	Their party website states, "We will put paid to bloated government bureaucracy and its authoritarian inclinations."
SNT.83139.13153	Mr Darnton said that one of the biggest jobs of Libertarianz is to show New Zealanders how their lives could be better.
SNT.83139.13154	"We just smile and get on with the next thing."
SNT.83139.13155	Libertarianz is, as Mr Milmine says, "principled opposition to the idea of a large nanny-state government in New Zealand."
SNT.83139.13156	"A burglar stealing your TV is in the wrong because they are taking without permission."
SNT.83139.13157	"The government steals a proportion of your wealth every year, the fact that they allow a minor amount of input from you into how they are going to distribute the stolen loot does not change the fact that they stole it in the first place."
SNT.83139.13158	Mr Darnton also describes the current system of governance as a game.
SNT.83139.13159	"What's right or wrong doesn't really matter as long as the red team or the blue team or whoever is scoring more points."
SNT.83139.13160	"The reason this political philosophy, underpinned by objectivism, isn't well accepted in the New Zealand culture is because New Zealanders are generally wary of major change, vote for the party they always have, and vote for the party they think will win, not the one they want to win," Mr Darton believes.
SNT.83139.13161	"These sorts of behaviour reinforce the big parties, even though neither have much to offer," Mr Darton said, "What Libertarianz is proposing is something quite different to anything any other party is putting forward."
SNT.83139.13161-2	Mr Milmine sees New Zealanders accepting libertarianism because, "Slowly people see that the government doesn’t solve their problems, it caused them in the first place." 
SNT.83139.13161-3	And when this is followed by a significant minority, Mr Milmine says, the change will happen very quickly.
SNT.83139.13162	Although Mr Milmine does say that he cannot predict what will happen to New Zealand if it were to change to a libertarianism state, "because it is asking me to predict the interactions of over four million people when they are given freedom to run their own lives."
SNT.83139.13163	As well as changing the system of Government, Libertarianz also propose New Zealand becoming a republic and removing the constitutional monarchy.
SNT.83139.13164	Mr Darnton said, "The monarchy is so distant in New Zealand that I don't think becoming a republic would make a big difference in many people's lives." 
SNT.83139.13164-2	Mr Milmine says, "A head of state has a valid role to play as a check on the power on the government, but it cannot perform this role if it is toothless."
SNT.83139.13165	Although Mr Darnton believes that New Zealand will eventually become a republic, he is wary of making a push to it too quickly.
SNT.83139.13166	He cites anti-prosperity and the governmental interference as issues that could make it into a written constitution and making it harder to shift later.
SNT.83139.13167	While Mr Milmine says they would run into problems with people disagreeing with the Treaty of Waitangi if it were placed into a written constitution.
SNT.83139.13168	And the final question asked to both Craig Milmine and Bernard Darnton was whether they were a Holden or a Ford fan.
SNT.83139.13169	Mr Milmine said he preferred "Subaru – I prefer the rallies – they allow more freedom" while Mr Darnton bluntly said, "No, I'm not."
SNT.33264.13170	According to federal prosecutors, Lewis "Scooter" Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, told a grand jury that his superiors authorized him to disclose to reporters information from the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate.
SNT.33264.13171	Portions of the report included still-classified information on Iraqi weapons capability leaked in June and July 2003.
SNT.33264.13172	Libby's claim of authorization was revealed in a letter by special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald, written January 23 and included in papers filed in court by Libby's defense team on Monday.
SNT.33264.13173	Although this letter did not say which "superiors" Libby referred to, the National Journal reported on Thursday that their sources said this included his immediate boss, V.P. Cheney
SNT.33264.13174	Mr. Libby was obliged to step down after he was indicted on charges that he lied about his role in exposing the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson, a C.I.A. operative, to the journalist Robert Novak in July 2003.
SNT.33264.13175	Federal prosecutors plan to use the confession to establish that Mr. Libby was part of the Bush administration's public relations campaign to rebut Mr. Wilson's op-ed column in The New York Times.
SNT.33264.13176	The column stated that there was little evidence to support the administration's claims that Saddam Hussein was pursuing weapons of mass destruction.
SNT.195983.13177	Jonathan Ross presented his final episode of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on the BBC after more than nine years.
SNT.195983.13178	He also finished hosting his programme on BBC Radio 2.
SNT.195983.13179	Ross announced his departure from the BBC in January 2010, having decided not to renew his contract with the broadcasting organisation.
SNT.195983.13180	The guests that appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on Friday were English football player David Beckham, American actor Mickey Rourke and Jackie Chan, an actor from Hong Kong.
SNT.195983.13181	Ross has stated that he was "ashamed of" few programmes and that "[t]he vast majority are shows I am proud of."
SNT.195983.13182	He felt "grateful, lucky and honoured" to have been able to work at the BBC.
SNT.195983.13183	When talking about his programme on BBC Radio 2, during his final pre-recorded three-hour-long edition broadcast yesterday, Jonathan Ross commented: "It has been a tremendous experience for us - obviously I like to think that the place has always been a little livelier while we are around."
SNT.195983.13184	"There were certain periods when it was a little too lively, but it's been a great experience and a learning experience, bizarrely for people of our age."
SNT.195983.13185	The final song to be played at the end of the show was "Drive-In Saturday", performed by David Bowie.
SNT.195983.13186	Jonathan Ross is expected to present a new television chat show on commercial British channel ITV at some point in the future.
SNT.195983.13187	It is believed that Graham Norton will be the replacement for Jonathan Ross as of 2011.
SNT.81747.13188	There are two things one can expect on a trip to see Michael Musto at the offices of the Village Voice: a 20-minute round-trip wait for the elevator and rapid fire answers from one of the most recognizable gossip columnists in the United States.
SNT.81747.13189	Musto, in addition to his appearances on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and the E! network, has been writing his column for the Voice since 1984.
SNT.81747.13190	He has recently compiled the best of them in a book released this year titled, La Dolce Musto: Writings by the World's Most Outrageous Columnist.
SNT.81747.13191	He was Carrie Bradshaw, replete with a prodigious use of puns, before Sex and the City was a thought.
SNT.81747.13192	His column is a romp through his life, spats and opinions on socio-political issues.
SNT.81747.13193	As David Thigpen of the Chicago Tribune wrote, Musto is "a funny and caustic satirist who masquerades as a gossip and nightlife columnist."
SNT.81747.13194	Musto, a Columbia University graduate, is a rarity in today's celebrity world: he is accessible.
SNT.81747.13195	He often corresponds with his readers and his public functions are a mix of parties, nightclubs, academic lectures, university panels and film premieres.
SNT.81747.13196	He is friendly and frank, and he welcomes people to join him in his world ("I just got a message that Michael Lucas died!" he says staring wide-eyed at his phone; the message turned out to be false).
SNT.81747.13197	Wikinews reporter David Shankbone spoke with Musto about his life and his relationship to the world of celebrity journalism.
SNT.187350.13198	According to Democratic Senator Mark Begich from Alaska, the U.S. Department of the Interior has decided to halt all new Arctic exploratory oil drilling applications until 2011.
SNT.187350.13199	The response is believed to be caused in part by the two current oil spill disasters (that of the Deepwater Horizon Incident and more recently the Alaska oil pipeline malfunction).
SNT.187350.13200	However, Begich is not happy about the actions taken by the White House.
SNT.187350.13201	"I am frustrated that this decision by the Obama administration to halt offshore development for a year will cause more delays and higher costs for domestic oil and gas production to meet the nation's energy needs," Begich claims.
SNT.187350.13202	Last September, the state of Alaska made a public notice about Shell's desire to drill off the coast of the Beaufort Sea, placing experimental drilling rigs at two drill site location: "Torpedo" and "Sivulliq".
SNT.187350.13203	"Shell is committed to undertaking a safe and environmentally responsible exploration program in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea in 2010," said Shell Oil Company President Marvin E. Odum to the U.S. Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service (MMS).
SNT.187350.13204	Odum follows with, "I am confident that we are ready to conduct the 2010 Arctic exploratory program safely and, I want to be clear, the accountability for this program rests with Shell."
SNT.187350.13205	Chuck Clausen, director of the Alaska project at the National Resources Defense Council is not so optimistic:
SNT.187350.13205-2	"Hazards present in the Arctic can include frigid temperatures, presence of sea ice, gale-force winds, intense storms and heavy fog ..."
SNT.187350.13206	Odum believes that the climate in the arctic will make any spill easier to clean up because, "Arctic conditions create differences in responding to oil in cold and ice conditions."
SNT.187350.13207	"Differences in evaporation rates, viscosity and weathering provide greater opportunities to recover oil."
SNT.187350.13208	"In Arctic conditions, ice can aid oil spill response by slowing oil weathering, dampening waves, preventing oil from spreading over large distances, and allowing more time to respond."
SNT.187350.13209	However, Clausen believes that there are no current systems to remove oil from icy ocean waters.
SNT.187350.13210	This is not the first time that President Obama's administration has taken the environmentally cautious path in Alaska.
SNT.187350.13211	The President put Bristol Bay off limits to oil and gas exploration until 2017.
SNT.187350.13212	Bristol Bay currently is one of the top salmon fishing grounds in the state.
SNT.187350.13213	Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is expected to give a speech at Thursday's White House address, regarding the suspension of Arctic oil drilling projects.
SNT.384571.13214	Terry Knutsen, a man who achieved some notoriety in the 1960s with the novelty song Curse of the Hearse, was seriously injured in a collision late Wednesday evening, according to sources close to the singer.
SNT.384571.13215	Mr. Knutsen, 70, routinely billed himself under the stage name Terry Teene and some sources indicate he may have recorded as many as 300 songs.
SNT.384571.13216	Yesterday morning, local media reports indicated that his condition was listed as "critical", but a source close to Mr. Knutsen described his condition yesterday morning as "grave".
SNT.384571.13217	Mr. Knutsen has performed for many years throughout Texas as a professional clown.
SNT.384571.13218	He made a brief (uncredited) appearance many years ago on one episode of the hit television show In Living Color.
SNT.384571.13219	Sources indicate he also had minor roles in various films.
SNT.34427.13220	Simon Crean, Shadow Minister for Regional Development, has accused the Howard Government of abandoning regional development and showing no commitment to rural Australia.
SNT.34427.13221	In a media release timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Howard Government, Mr. Crean said that the privatisation of Telstra and a failure to reform the Regional Partnerships program demonstrated the government's lack of commitment to the bush.
SNT.34427.13222	"The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has failed to clean up the Regional Partnerships program, four months after a Senate Inquiry recommended major changes," he said.
SNT.34427.13223	"AU$1.1 million dollars spent on the Gunnedah Grains to Ethanol project has been wasted - it still hasn't produced a single litre of ethanol."
SNT.34427.13224	"Likewise Beaudesert Rail, the recipient of $5.7 million in Government grants, has not travelled a single kilometre."
SNT.34427.13225	Regional Partnerships program provides government assistance for projects in regional areas.
SNT.34427.13226	According to a government media release, there is $360.9 million available under this program for the period 2005-06 to 2008-09.
SNT.34427.13227	Mr Crean also criticised the National party for "[selling out] rural and regional Australia - on Telstra, on trade and on essential services."
SNT.34427.13228	"Last week's revelation that Telstra plans to get rid of 5000 payphones after privatisation show the serial contempt of the Bush by the Coalition."
SNT.34427.13229	The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Warren Truss, has distanced himself from the Telstra announcement, saying that Telstra has an obligation to maintain services.
SNT.34427.13230	"Certainly, there is a still a demand for payphones around Australia."
SNT.34427.13231	"Telstra are expected to provide those kinds of services," he said.
SNT.34427.13232	"I think the time will come when we will move on to new technology and some of those systems that were more important in the past will be less important in the future but there are still many Australians who still depend on payphones and community telephone systems."
SNT.34427.13233	Warren Truss' office was contacted to provide a response to Mr. Crean's criticisms, but had not responded by the time this article was published.
SNT.149697.13234	A court martial got underway today accusing a Canadian soldier of murder for shooting a member of the Taliban on an Afghan battlefield.
SNT.149697.13235	Captain Robert Semrau's case is believed to be a military and legal first.
SNT.149697.13236	Semrau, 38, is facing four charges for the 2008 death.
SNT.149697.13237	He is accused of second-degree murder, attempted murder, behaving in a disgraceful manner, and negligently performing a military duty.
SNT.149697.13238	It is alleged that he shot the man twice despite him being an unarmed and "seriously wounded" prisoner.
SNT.149697.13239	Court documents set a scene in which 36-year-old Semrau was in charge of a small group of soldiers caught in an ambush on October 19 last year.
SNT.149697.13240	The Canadians were mentoring some new Afghan recruits, who were under British command.
SNT.149697.13241	A United States Apache assault helicopter provided assistance to the group, who were in Lashkar Gah, Helmand, strafing the area.
SNT.149697.13242	After beating back their attackers the soldiers discovered a fighter with injuries deemed to be so severe that medical aid would be ineffective, along with a dead man.
SNT.149697.13243	Shortly afterwards, with only Semrau near the man, two gunshots were heard.
SNT.149697.13244	At least one eyewitness claims to have watched Semrau shooting the militant with his field rifle.
SNT.149697.13245	Troops then moved on and the man's body was never recovered.
SNT.149697.13246	Captain Semrau was not investigated for two months, when his superiors heard of the alleged killing.
SNT.149697.13247	He was ultimately arrested by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service a month later and charged.
SNT.149697.13248	He is now set to go on trial before Colonel Mario Duti, a military judge, and a five-member panel.
SNT.149697.13249	The Canadian Press contacted Michel Drapeau, a retired lawyer and colonel.
SNT.149697.13250	He says he believes it to be the first time Canada has launched a court martial for the death of a prisoner on the battlefield.
SNT.149697.13251	"I can't remember any such incidents in the past 50 years and in the Second World War, I don't believe there was such a court martial."
SNT.149697.13252	"There are a few recorded instances of alleged extra-judicial killing by Canadian soldiers, but no court martials for murder."
SNT.149697.13253	Two Canadian soldiers faced a murder charge for the death of a teenager in Somalia in 1993 but the case was dropped; some evidence emerged during the inquiry that suggested another man may also have been killed illegally.
SNT.149697.13254	More anecdotally, Canadians have been accused of similar murders in Korea and of shooting German prisoners for revenge during the second world war.
SNT.59717.13255	Microsoft Corp. is establishing, in Shanghai, China, a center for research and development.
SNT.59717.13256	It will be Microsoft's first research and development center of this kind outside the U.S.
SNT.59717.13257	Microsoft decided to take this step because of several setbacks that occurred in its online services working in China.
SNT.59717.13258	The company's new research and development center is to be established in Shanghai's Zizhu Science Park.
SNT.59717.13259	At this location, where another giant, Intel Corp, already has its research office, Microsoft plans to develop Internet software.
SNT.59717.13260	It will have a special technical support team that will work on Microsoft's MSN Messenger.
SNT.59717.13261	The company hopes to make its online communication tool popular among Chinese teenagers and young professionals.
SNT.59717.13262	However, the software giant lacks a facility to work with its well-known MSN service.
SNT.59717.13263	Investing in its communication tool may strengthen the company's leading position on the Chinese market.
SNT.59717.13264	Setting up the MSN research and development center in Peoples Republic of China implies that Microsoft looks forward to taking advantage of the Chinese market, which represents a quite flexible environment.
SNT.59717.13265	This statement was made by Doug Crets, who works at Media Partners Asia as a Hong-Kong-based analyst.
SNT.580609.13266	Around 9:40am (Wednesday) Sydney time and 2:40pm (Tuesday) California time, on ABC News 24 (of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation), a reporter covering the United States election said the network would call California for Barack Obama before the polls closed.
SNT.580609.13267	The reporter went on to explain that the media in the United States avoids doing this so as not to affect voter turnout, but as they are reporting in Australia, this is not a local concern and they are not concerned about making predictions about race results.
SNT.580609.13268	Going into the elections, Obama was already forecast to win in California, with RealClearPolitics predicting he would win by 14 points.
SNT.580609.13269	ABC OTUS had also predicted Obama would win the state.
SNT.580609.13270	Predicting election results before actual returns has been a problem historically, such as when Florida was called for Al Gore before all the votes had been counted.
SNT.49042.13271	The Scugog flag controversy has now came to an end.
SNT.49042.13272	The controversy began when councillor Lynn Philip Hodgson lowered the town hall flag out of respect for a fallen Canadian soldier.
SNT.49042.13273	Rather than an issue of patriotism, the controversy dealt with union contracts which may have specified that the raising and lowering of flags was a role reserved only for union members.
SNT.49042.13274	"I thought I was doing the right thing at the time and I still think I did," Hodgson said yesterday.
SNT.49042.13275	"The public reaction to the lowering of the flag in a timely manner needs to be addressed," said Drebit.
SNT.49042.13276	The union dropped the grievance and said it was all a "misunderstanding."
SNT.161255.13277	An extensive vaccination campaign across 19 West and Central African countries is to begin today in an attempt to stem a year-long polio epidemic in the region.
SNT.161255.13278	The United Nations and international aid agencies plan to immunize 85 million children under five.
SNT.161255.13279	More than 400, 000 volunteers and health workers will take part in the campaign, visiting children in their homes.
SNT.161255.13280	The current polio epidemic has been going on for a year and there have been outbreaks in the last six months in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone.
SNT.161255.13281	These countries will be the focus of the campaign, along with Benin, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Nigeria and Togo.
SNT.161255.13282	Efforts last year failed to halt the disease because not enough children were vaccinated.
SNT.161255.13283	The program failed in part because local religious leaders told parents that the vaccines would sterilize their children, or cause AIDS.
SNT.161255.13284	As well as targeting more children, today's campaign features better training for volunteers.
SNT.161255.13285	Vaccinations will be repeated on 26 March in the six key countries, and again on 24 April for all 19 countries involved.
SNT.161255.13286	The campaign is funded by Rotary International who have provided $30 million.
SNT.161255.13287	In 2009 the World Health Organization reported that approximately 1,600 children were paralysed by the virus worldwide.
SNT.31106.13288	At least eight people have died in a fire in a multi-storied office center, namely, in the office belonging to the Russian Savings Bank (Sberbank), in the Russian Pacific port city of Vladivostok, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said Monday.
SNT.31106.13289	A spokesman said that the blaze broke at about 12:00 local time (02:00 UTC) on the sixth floor of the building.
SNT.31106.13290	Some of the victims died when they jumped out windows in an attempt to escape the flames.
SNT.31106.13291	In addition to the fatalities, another 15 people were hospitalized with burns and injuries.
SNT.31106.13292	According to firefighters, serious breaches of fire-safety regulations were partly to blame for the deaths.
SNT.31106.13293	A door to the attic was locked and people could not escape through an emergency exit.
SNT.31106.13294	A team of investigators led by the deputy prosecutor of the Maritime Territory, Sergei Luchaninov, is looking into how the fire started.
SNT.107193.13295	South African media have reported that police staff in South Africa were arrested on allegations of fraud.
SNT.107193.13296	Police said Saturday that nine people including six employees of the South African Police Service were arrested in Mpumalanga.
SNT.107193.13297	A spokesperson for the police service, Captain Leonard Hlathi, said that the other three individuals have resigned from the police.
SNT.107193.13298	Hlathi said that the individuals were arrested for fraud, corruption and theft, and allegedly defrauded South Africa of approximately R2.5-million (about US$327,000) between 2003 and 2007.
SNT.107193.13299	"This was a syndicate that has cost the police service more than R2.5million and we believe we have made a breakthrough," said Hlathi.
SNT.107193.13300	Hlathi told the South African Press Association that the investigation began in April 2007 and showed that the suspects registered companies in the South Africa police database, though no existing files were found for the companies themselves.
SNT.107193.13301	He said that three out of the five companies were found not to exist.
SNT.107193.13302	The suspects were arrested on Friday by the Mpumalanga organized crime unit.
SNT.107193.13303	"We have a warrant of arrest that we are happy to execute against you right away."
SNT.107193.13304	"You are now under arrest on charges of fraud and you have the right to remain silent if you so wish," said Superintendent Obed Ngwenya, police organized crime unit head, prior to arresting one of the individuals.
SNT.107193.13305	The individuals arrested appeared in the Nelspruit magistrate's court on Friday.
SNT.107193.13306	They were released with a subsequent court date set for June 21.
SNT.45880.13307	While whole blocks of Beirut are leveled to rubble and civilians flee by the thousands, the U.S. administration is, according to the New York Times expediting a delivery of bombs to Israel.
SNT.45880.13308	An op-ed piece in the Sydney Morning Herald concludes that the sale of more American arms to the Israeli arm will cause anger and might be used to justify Iran supplying missiles to Hezbollah.
SNT.45880.13309	According to Arab political analysts the decision to rush more bombs to Israel will increase existing anti-American feelings in the Middle East and will help radicals.
SNT.45880.13310	The rushing of more bombs to Israel is consistent with US policy, according to a report issued three days ago by the World Policy Institute which indicates that Israel has always been the largest recipient of military aid from the United States.
SNT.45880.13311	According to Frida Berrigan, co-author of the review entitled 'U.S. Military Assistance and Arms Transfers to Israel: U.S. Aid, Companies Fuel Israeli Military', U.S. military aid to Israel is about $3 billion a year.
SNT.45880.13312	This equates to about 20% of the Israeli military budget annually.
SNT.45880.13313	According to Berrigan, in an interview given to Democracy Now on Friday, just on the 14th of July while calling for restraint the U.S. also sold $120 million worth of jet fuel to the Israeli military assisting their bombing campaign of Lebanon.
SNT.45880.13314	In fact, Berrigan said, since the Bush administration came into power, about a total of $6.3 billion worth of weapons sold to Israel.
SNT.45880.13315	Berrigan also added that if in fact the United States wanted to cut military aid at this time they have precedent to do so, citing as an example the Reagan administration's cut of military aid and freezing of weapons sales to Israel during its last invasion of Lebanon in 1981, during the then conflict's first 10 weeks.
SNT.45880.13316	Israel claims they have been using precision-guided munitions in order to neutralize Hezbollah and to minimize harm to civilians.
SNT.45880.13317	However, U.N. and Lebanese officials estimate at least 360 Lebanese civilians have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded, with about 700,000 people already displaced since Israel's bombings began.
SNT.45880.13318	According to the United Nation's emergency relief co-coordinator, Jan Egeland, nearly one third of casualties resulting from the Israeli offensive in Lebanon have been children.
SNT.45880.13319	Egeland, who visited Lebanon today denounced the Israeli strikes and appealed for safe passage for aid, saying civilians were paying a "disproportionate price" in the attacks targeting Hezbollah strongholds.
SNT.45880.13320	He said civilians are paying a disproportionate price in Lebanon and northern Israel and stated that "A disproportionate response by Israel is a violation of international humanitarian law."
SNT.45880.13321	In many capital cities around the world including the Middle East, as well as Europe, Canada, Latin America and the United States thousands of people took part in demonstrations against the Israeli strikes.
SNT.45880.13322	In London people marched to the US embassy and shouted slogans such as "George Bush, terrorist" and "Down, down, USA."
SNT.45880.13323	In Tel Aviv 1,000 Israeli Jews and Arabs also turned out to denounce their country's actions, gathering in Rabin Square and brandishing placards reading "war is disaster" and "Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies."
SNT.107318.13324	Doctors performing a Caesarian delivery in a Darwin, Australia hospital were stunned to discover a rare ovarian ectopic pregnancy.
SNT.107318.13325	According to Robin Cahill, general manager of the Darwin Private Hospital, ovarian pregnancies occur in only 1 in every 40,000 fertilisations.
SNT.107318.13326	An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants in a woman's body in a location other than the uterus.
SNT.107318.13327	The most common place for an ectopic pregnancy to occur is the Fallopian tubes, accounting for roughly 95% of all ectopic pregnancies.
SNT.107318.13328	Ectopic pregnancies are generally discovered early, especially as they tend to cause bleeding in the mother, and tend to miscarry or be terminated due to the health risks they pose.
SNT.107318.13329	The mother, Meera Thangarajah, however, suffered no complications during her pregnancy, and an ultrasound performed mid-way through the pregnancy did not discover the complication.
SNT.107318.13330	The hospital's obstetrician Andrew Miller says that having an ovarian pregnancy survive to full-term is "unheard of".
SNT.107318.13331	The British Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists agrees, with a representative saying the odds of a successful ovarian pregnancy are "no more than one in a million", taking into account both the difficulty of bringing such a pregnancy to term and the tendency for the pregnancy to be terminated when it is discovered early.
SNT.107318.13332	The baby, a girl, was named Durga, a Hindu name meaning "goddess", and weighed 6 pounds 3 ounces (2.8 kg).
SNT.107318.13333	The father, Ravi Thangarajah, says that doctors told him he was "one of the luckiest men in the world".
SNT.5705.13334	The play is scheduled to open March, 18, as part of the Theater Festival of Curitiba.
SNT.102879.13335	In the past two months, Parker Somerville, a videographer for the website TMZ.com, transitioned from an average guy leading an ordinary life, to living in an extraordinary voyeuristic existence, and back again to the beginning.
SNT.102879.13336	Simply put, it was a transition from reality to reality, with a two-week detour in reality television.
SNT.102879.13337	Somerville was a former contestant on the CBS reality TV staple Big Brother, currently in its ninth installment.
SNT.102879.13338	Evicted on Day 14, Somerville hoped to have another chance to play the game, but came in second in the special "America's Choice" poll to bring back a former HouseGuest (the poll results were eventually not used at all and nobody was brought back).
SNT.102879.13339	Now freed from a three-week sequester, Somerville was interviewed by Wikinews reporter Mike Halterman and he discussed his thoughts on Big Brother, how he and his fellow HouseGuests were portrayed and received, and what he plans to do now that his experience is, for the most part, over.
SNT.102879.13340	Somerville will return to Big Brother on finale night in five weeks.
SNT.102879.13341	Big Brother airs on CBS in the United States, Global in Canada, and E4 in the United Kingdom.
SNT.118386.13342	The Coast Guard reported yesterday that a cargo ship laden with cement sank overnight in the Philippines, killing the vessel's chief engineer.
SNT.118386.13343	A passing ship rescued the 19 others, while a coast guard rescue boat itself required rescue in strong waves in the region after getting into difficulties before losing contact.
SNT.118386.13344	MV Maria Lourdes, a 639-ton vessel, had been transporting 22,000 bags of cement from Iligan City in Lanao del Norte and was headed towards a town in Occidental Mindoro when the starboard main engine failed.
SNT.118386.13345	While running on only the port main engine, strong waves battered the ship until shortly after 7:00 p.m. Tuesday night, when she went down at Antique.
SNT.118386.13346	The Coast Guard received word on the emergency at 7:03 p.m. from Candano Shipping Lines.
SNT.118386.13347	Vessel 3504 was dispatched to aid the stricken ship, but the boat was also troubled by strong waves and eventually contact was lost.
SNT.118386.13348	A passing ship rescued the survivors from the Maria Lourdes instead.
SNT.118386.13349	Vessel 3504's crew were located on Sibay Island by the Philippine Air Force.
SNT.118386.13350	The seven-man crew had abandoned the boat to rough seas and sought refuge on the island.
SNT.44324.13351	People came across Canada to Ottawa to celebrate Canada's 139th birthday.
SNT.44324.13352	About 25,000 people including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, his wife and their two children were there.
SNT.44324.13353	Military veterans, medal-winning Olympic athletes and some of Canada's biggest names in music were there.
SNT.44324.13354	Canadian artists like Colin James and Annie Villeneuve performed in front of the Peace Tower.
SNT.44324.13355	Since Canada has two official languages (English and French) some artists were from Quebec and sung in French.
SNT.44324.13356	Prime Minister Stephen Harper urged Canadians to pay tribute to the soldiers and aid workers in Afghanistan.
SNT.44324.13357	"Let's show our appreciation, today and every day, to those who do it best for us in Afghanistan and around the world," Harper said.
SNT.44324.13358	"Our diplomats, our development workers and brave men and women of the Canadian Forces."
SNT.44324.13359	Michaëlle Jean noted Canada's prosperity, including in her remarks a thank you to the people who toil to provide the country with a safe and plentiful food supply.
SNT.44324.13360	Bill Graham released a statement describing Canada as being like no other country, "made up of individuals, representing all ethnicities and all religions, bound together by our shared values of family, community, tolerance and freedom."
SNT.44324.13361	Musicians performed in front of the Peace Tower, and fireworks ended the show.
SNT.99007.13362	George W. Bush, the president of the United States has visited Tennessee, which was hit by over 25 tornadoes which caused over 33 deaths.
SNT.99007.13363	In the visit Mr.Bush said that "the government has got a role to play" in repairing the damage from the tornado and that anyone who has been affected should call 1-800-621-3362 to "find out the help that is available."
SNT.99007.13364	Later in the speech Mr.Bush said that he's "sorry you're going through what you're going through," to the residents of Macon County, which he was visiting.
SNT.99007.13365	He continued by saying that "life sometimes is unfair and you don't get to play the hand that you wanted to play," and that he believes "the question is when you get dealt the hand, how do you play it?"
SNT.99007.13365-2	He continued by saying that the community of Macon County "is going to be as strong as ever."
SNT.123105.13366	Andry Rajoelina, who ousted Madagascan ex-president President Marc Ravalomanana earlier this week, officially became the leader of the country, after being sworn in on Saturday.
SNT.123105.13367	National television broadcasted the inauguration, which occurred at a soccer field in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.
SNT.123105.13368	Tens of thousands of people attended the event, although approximately 2,000 supporters of Ravalomanana held protests in the capital's Democracy Square.
SNT.123105.13369	"We proclaim today the end of the dictatorship," said the new president, promising to tackle corruption that was rife under Ravalomanana.
SNT.123105.13370	Earlier this week, then-president Ravalomanana gave up his power to military forces, which subsequently gave Rajoelina control over the government.
SNT.123105.13371	Many foreign powers, among them the United States and France, have denounced the change in leadership as a coup.
SNT.123105.13372	Norway and the US have both frozen all non-humanitarian aid to Madagascar, whilst the African Union suspended Madagascar's membership.
SNT.123105.13373	The South African Development Community (SADC) stated that it "completely rejected the legitimacy" of the new president.
SNT.49886.13374	At least three assailants tried to storm the U.S. embassy in the Rawda area of Damascus, Syria.
SNT.49886.13375	According to reports, there was an exchange of gunfire and explosions were heard due to a car being blown up.
SNT.49886.13376	A Chinese diplomat was injured by a stray bullet while he was standing on top of the Chinese embassy building, located close to US embassy.
SNT.106636.13377	A bus crash in France's Loire Valley has left seven of the Moroccan passengers dead.
SNT.106636.13378	22 of the 32 on board were injured, four critically, after the bus smashed into a concrete pillar on the A10 near Blois in the small hours of yesterday morning.
SNT.106636.13379	The bus had departed Tiznit in South Morocco on Wednesday and was headed to the Parisian suburb of Les Mureaux.
SNT.106636.13380	It had been hired by Aziz, a French company that provides buses to tourists and small traders heading between France and Morocco.
SNT.106636.13381	Media images show the vehicle's front end stuck several feet up the pillar, with the roof trapped against the top of the bridge it supported by the pillar.
SNT.106636.13382	The entire wreck is left leaning at about a forty degree angle back towards the road, and has left the road at a fairly steep angle directly into the pillar.
SNT.106636.13383	The remains of a trailer it was towing can be seen still attached at the rear of the coach.
SNT.106636.13384	Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau, who visited the scene shortly after the accident, said that "The incredible state of the bus showed that the impact was extremely violent."
SNT.106636.13385	The pictures showed the bus was in the livery of travel company Labat.
SNT.106636.13386	The French Interior Ministry took the rare step of activating an emergency plan to ensure rapid response from large numbers of rescuers and resources.
SNT.106636.13387	The scene was attended by four helicopters, 140 firefighters and 25 police officers, who had to free multiple victims from the wreck.
SNT.106636.13388	Six died immediately, and the seventh victim died shortly afterwards.
SNT.106636.13389	All the deceased were adults, and included one of the two drivers, the other of whom was seriously injured.
SNT.106636.13390	Investigators believe no other vehicles were involved, but the exact circumstances remain unclear.
SNT.106636.13391	"Is this linked to a mechanical problem, drowsiness or a totally different cause?" Bussereau said at the scene.
SNT.106636.13392	His ministry's accident investigation bureau will conduct a major investigation inquiry, and a separate investigation will be launched by local prosecuters.
SNT.106636.13393	One possible cause is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel.
SNT.106636.13394	Investigators are also examining the bus to try to determine any sign of mechanical trouble.
SNT.106636.13395	There was good weather in the region of the town of Suevres, where the accident occurred, and very little traffic was using the road at the time, thought to be around 2.50am (0050 GMT).
SNT.106636.13396	Morocco's King Mohammed VI has announced he will personally pay for care of the injured and repatriation of those killed.
SNT.106636.13397	He also asked the ambassador to France to pass on his condolences.
SNT.110989.13398	American celebutante and businesswoman Paris Hilton has bashed a recent presidential campaign ad by 2008 U.S. presidential hopeful John McCain in which he compared his rival Barack Obama to celebrities such as Hilton and Britney Spears.
SNT.110989.13399	In McCain's TV ad, it was stated that Obama was "the biggest celebrity in the world."
SNT.110989.13400	Hilton recorded and uploaded a video to comedy website Funny or Die, in which she mocked McCain by calling him a "wrinkly white-haired guy."
SNT.110989.13401	"I am Paris Hilton, and I am a celebrity too," she states at the beginning of the video, but not before images of the Star Wars character Yoda and the cast of The Golden Girls are paraded across the screen apparently comparing the characters to McCain.
SNT.110989.13402	"Only I am not from the olden days, and I am not promising change like 'that other guy'."
SNT.110989.13403	"I'm just hot," remarked Hilton, adding, "I guess I am running for president," since McCain's TV ad showed her.
SNT.110989.13404	McCain's advertisement, released early this week, states, "Is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family?" 
SNT.110989.13404-2	According to the Boston Globe and video displayed on its website, the narrator then points out that "the real Obama promises higher taxes, more government spending."
SNT.110989.13405	Bill Burton, a spokesman for Obama, responded to the ad: 
SNT.110989.13405-2	"Is the biggest proponent of George Bush’s tired, failed policies ready to bring about change?" 
SNT.110989.13405-3	"Another day brings another dishonest attack from John McCain."
SNT.110989.13406	"While Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95% of American families, what he’s not telling us is that he wants to give $4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies, continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas, and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class families."
SNT.110989.13407	Hilton appears in good spirits in her video and even thanks McCain for endorsing her.
SNT.110989.13408	"And I want America to know, that I am like totally ready to lead."
SNT.75024.13409	Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan has won stage 15 of the 2007 Tour de France in a time of 5h 34' 28".
SNT.75024.13410	Michael Rasmussen of Denmark kept his overall lead by 2' 23' over Alberto Contador of Spain.

SNT.175926.13412	The United States Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing unveiled a new United States one hundred-dollar bill Wednesday morning.
SNT.175926.13413	This is the first time that the one hundred dollar note has been redesigned since 1996.
SNT.175926.13414	Until now the one hundred dollar note, along with the one and two dollar notes, was not part of the newest batch of dollar note redesigns.
SNT.175926.13415	The Bureau of Engraving and Printing redesigned the series 2006 5, 10, 20, and 50 dollar notes previously.
SNT.175926.13416	The new one hundred dollar note will contain new security and design features.
SNT.175926.13417	Along with a new stylized portrait of Benjamin Franklin, the note also features a quill pen and inkwell on the obverse.
SNT.175926.13418	On the reverse it has a new larger printed '100' in gold lettering.
SNT.175926.13419	The new security features include a EURion constellation, a new more secure watermark, and a new feature called 'motion' which uses 650,000 micro lenses to create a moving image.
SNT.175926.13420	The note was originally slated for release in 2008 although budget constraints pushed the release date back to late 2009 or early to mid 2010.
SNT.175926.13421	The note will go into general circulation by early 2011.
SNT.113974.13422	According to YouTube the 11 videos were removed by direct DMCA requests from Schaper.
SNT.113974.13423	The videos have been reported to be of anti-Scientology protests, recorded by various members of the group Anonymous.
SNT.113974.13424	In early September, an entity named American Rights Counsel LLC -- which has described itself as a 'rights group', but without provision of contact details -- requested the removal from YouTube of over 4,000 anti-Scientology videos.
SNT.113974.13425	Many of these videos consisted entirely of self-made content by anti-Scientology protesters; others were quite explicitly extracts from official Church of Scientology footage.
SNT.113974.13426	Users had initially speculated that Schaper was responsible for these requests; no evidence, however, has been obtained to this effect, nor has official comment been obtained from American Rights Counsel.
SNT.113974.13427	Wikinews contacted Schaper to find out why he made the new requests.
SNT.113974.13428	According to him, the videos were not of protests against Scientology, but instead were videos of alleged hate-crimes and hate-speech, which were allegedly attacking Schaper personally.
SNT.113974.13429	"The videos in question have been produced by an YouTube (U.K.) user to directly attack me and my companies."
SNT.113974.13430	"I made the requests in accordance with YouTube’s terms and condition, after confirming directly with YouTube and the local ECTF office in Los Angeles, to remove material that infringes on my copyright."
SNT.113974.13431	"None of the videos removed by YouTube fall under the fair use guidelines or can be considered news-worthy."
SNT.113974.13432	"The content of the videos has been classified by law-enforcement as hate-speech and frivolous attack."
SNT.113974.13433	"The producers of these videos are based in the U.K. and local law-enforcement has been contacted by the FBI," said Schaper to Wikinews.
SNT.113974.13434	When Wikinews asked Schaper if he was acting on behalf of the Church, Schaper denied any such involvement.
SNT.113974.13435	He also stated that he was not attempting to remove videos critical of him, or the Church, but also emphasizes other videos still on YouTube that are "a personal attack against me and my beliefs."
SNT.113974.13436	"Despite the fact that I am a Scientologist, none of the videos removed, where removed on behalf of the Church of Scientology or any organization associated with the church."
SNT.113974.13437	"In addition I like to point out that I have not removed any video, critical of me personally which does not violate my copyrights and I have no intention to do so," said Schaper.
SNT.113974.13438	In addition, Wikinews invited Dr. Schaper to comment on the apparent discrepancy between his actions and his advocacy of free speech.
SNT.113974.13439	Dr. Schaper feels that that the two stated aims are not in conflict, stating, "I believe the First Amendment but I also see how Anonymous tries to abuse these liberties."
SNT.113974.13440	"Not everything is protected under the free speech clause and laws have been enacted to protect each citizen from abuse."
SNT.113974.13441	Schaper also stated that Anonymous is "breaking the law" by uploading material to YouTube which could be considered hate crimes.
SNT.113974.13442	He also states that he would not mind a one-on-one conversation with some members of Anonymous, but "these guys don’t have the balls for a direct sit-down because they should get their facts straight."
SNT.113974.13443	"Anonymous is overstating a case and claims that their abuse and online bullying would be protected under the First Amendment forgetting the fact that they indeed are breaking the laws," added Schaper.
SNT.113974.13444	Schaper does not plan on enforcing the Church's copyrights saying, "they can handle their own content" and that he "will continue to enforce my copyrights and seek full prosecution in cooperation with federal law-enforcement."
SNT.113974.13445	Wikinews has contacted YouTube for a statement regarding this incident, but has yet to receive a response.
SNT.101427.13446	An exchange of handshakes at a Latin American summit Friday marked the end of the bitter dispute that had taken place between the nations of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela over the past week.
SNT.101427.13447	The presidents of each country agreed to end the conflict, and said political ties would be reinstated.
SNT.101427.13448	"With the commitment of never attacking a brother country again and by asking forgiveness, we can consider this very serious incident resolved," said Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, as the other Latin American leaders applauded.
SNT.101427.13449	The dispute was over Colombia's air strike against FARC rebels, which Ecuador accused of entering their territory.
SNT.101427.13450	As a result, Ecuador and their ally Venezuela had sent troops to their borders and severed ties with Colombia.
SNT.101427.13451	At the summit, Uribe charged Correa's government of having links with the FARC rebels, a charge that Correa quickly denied.
SNT.101427.13452	He admitted there had been communication with the FARC, but only regarding the release of hostages held by the rebels, including French-Colombian politician Íngrid Betancourt.
SNT.101427.13453	Uribe insisted that Ecuador has not done enough to fight the rebels, which was the reason the operation had to remain a secret, he said.
SNT.101427.13454	"We have not gotten cooperation from President Correa in the fight against terrorism."
SNT.101427.13455	Correa then advocated the creation of an international peacekeeping force to control the border, saying that Ecuador has become a victim of the fighting in Colombia.
SNT.101427.13456	Finally, it was Dominican president Leonel Fernandez plea for peace that ended the feud.
SNT.101427.13457	He requested that the presidents shake hands with each other, which they did, in a televised gesture viewed live across Latin America.
SNT.101427.13458	Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, also agreed to reinstate diplomatic ties with Colombia after shaking hands with their president.
SNT.101427.13459	The leaders at the summit later approved a declaration in which Uribe apologized for the military operation and vowed never again to violate another nation's sovereignty.
SNT.101427.13460	It also mentioned a commitment to fight against threats posed by "irregular or criminal groups."
SNT.113699.13461	In a recent study released by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), economic opportunities for women are still lagging behind opportunities for men in the developing world.
SNT.113699.13462	Improvements have been made in women health and education, according to the study.
SNT.113699.13463	The study calls for investments totaling over US$13 billion a year to achieve gender equality and women empowerment.
SNT.113699.13464	Danny Leipziger, World Bank Vice President for Poverty Reduction and Economic Management, said, "gender equality is key for poverty reduction and growth."
SNT.113699.13465	"Progress on women’s education is essential but not enough if we don’t improve women’s access to good jobs and credit lines, to land ownership and to income-generating activities."
SNT.113699.13466	The study Equality for Women: Where Do We Stand on Millennium Development Goal 3? looks at the achievements made by the developing world as laid out by the Millennium Development Goals (MD).
SNT.113699.13467	These goals are eight international development goals that 189 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations have agreed to achieve by the year 2015.
SNT.113699.13468	They include halving extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS, and developing a global partnership for development.
SNT.113699.13469	Education has improved in 82 countries out of 122 and are on track to meet their MD goals.
SNT.113699.13470	However, 19 countries, 13 of which are in Sub- Saharan Africa, are seriously off track to meet their target.
SNT.113699.13471	The United Nations will hold a conference on Thursday at the annual session of the UN in New York to discuss the Millennium Development Goals.
SNT.147175.13472	The Ulster Defense Association (UDA), a paramilitary group in Northern Ireland that wants Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom, said today that it has rid itself of its weapons.
SNT.147175.13473	A statement by the group read, "The Ulster Defense Association was formed to defend our communities."
SNT.147175.13474	"We state quite clearly and categorically that this responsibility now rests with the government and its institutions where legitimacy resides."
SNT.147175.13475	UDA spokesperson Frankie Gallagher spoke at a press conference in Belfast, stating that the group regrets the approximately 400 people, primarily Catholic civilians, that they were responsible for the murder of between 1971 and 2001.
SNT.147175.13476	He added, "But we are determined and are willing to play our full part in ensuring that tragedy of the last 40 years will never happen again."
SNT.147175.13477	The destruction of ammunition and explosives was verified by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, stating that other groups have a deadline of February 9 to destroy arms they may still hold, after which they may potentially face imprisonment.
SNT.147175.13478	Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister, Micheál Martin, said in a statement, "This is a statement of confidence in the political process and in the devolved institutions."
SNT.147175.13479	Irish President Mary McAleese said the group's choice was "a very positive milestone on the journey of peace."
SNT.147175.13480	The other main "loyalist" groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Red Hand Commandos (RHC), are reported to have destroyed their arms last June, with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) having destroyed their arms four years ago.
SNT.147175.13481	However, two republican splinter groups, the Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) and the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA), have refused to lay down their arms and have continued to undertake attacks including three murders in March of 2009.
SNT.147175.13482	The Real IRA attacked the Massereene Barracks in Antrim, County Antrim on March 7 and killed two British soliders.
SNT.147175.13483	Three days later, The Continuity IRA claimed responsibility for the murder of Police Service of Northern Ireland officer Stephen Carroll, who was shot by a sniper responding to a call.
SNT.147175.13484	There is also concern that the power-sharing government between Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party may collapse because of disagreements between the parties on the issue of transferring policing and justice powers from London.
SNT.171853.13485	Officials say the crash, which occurred when the plane was approaching a Russian airport on Saturday, was due to dense fog, and that there are no survivors.
SNT.171853.13486	Sergei Antufyev, the governor of the Smolensk area, said on Russian television that no one survived the crash; the claim was backed by Polish news agencies as well.
SNT.171853.13487	"As it was preparing for landing, the Polish president's aircraft did not make it to the landing strip," he commented.
SNT.171853.13488	"According to preliminary reports, 85 members of the delegation and the crew," he added.
SNT.171853.13489	The exact passenger number was not known at first, with conflicting figures given by the Russian police, who said there were 132 people on board, and Polish officials.
SNT.171853.13490	However, a full flight manifest received from the Presidential Office has been published by several news portals, giving 96 as the number of killed in the crash, including eight members of the crew.
SNT.171853.13491	The manifest is also available on the Office's official web page.
SNT.171853.13492	Television footage showed the burning plane with its charred parts scattered in the forest where it crashed.
SNT.171853.13493	The plane crashed approximately two kilometres (1.3 miles) from Smolensk airport.
SNT.171853.13494	"Two flashes of fire next to each other," he said, as quoted by the BBC.
SNT.171853.13495	Several other Polish government figures were in the plane as well.
SNT.171853.13496	Poland has declared a week of national mourning after the incident.
SNT.171853.13497	Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was immediately appointed by Dmitry Medvedev, the president, as the head of the commission to investigate the crash.
SNT.171853.13498	The latter also sent Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister of emergency situations, to the site of the crash.
SNT.49452.13499	Princess Kiko has given birth to a 2,558 gram (5.639 lb) baby boy, on 6 September at 8 h 27 (Japan Standard Time).
SNT.49452.13500	He is the first male baby born in the Japanese imperial family since his father in 1965.
SNT.49452.13501	The baby was delivered with a Caesarean section, and will not be named until a ceremony seven days after his birth.
SNT.49452.13502	Emperor Akihito, currently on a tour of Hokkaido, welcomed the birth.
SNT.49452.13503	A number of traditional rites will take place, including the baby boy being symbolically presented with a sabre.
SNT.49452.13504	The boy will be the third in line to succeed to the Japanese throne after the Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Akishino, father of the child.
SNT.49452.13505	The fact that Crown Princess Masako wasn't able to have a boy to succeed the throne is thought to have provoked her depression and subsequent withdrawal from public activity.
SNT.49452.13506	Pressure from the Imperial Household Agency for another child was ineffective and therefore Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed a panel to find an alternative succession system.
SNT.49452.13507	The panel's recommendation to allow women to inherit the throne was met with fierce criticism from conservatives.
SNT.49452.13508	The birth of the baby boy eases the pressure for the reform which about 70% of Japanese favoured but which was postponed sine die when the news of the pregnancy came to the public.
SNT.49452.13509	Prince Akishino has previously criticized his elder brother for not trying to sire a boy.
SNT.49452.13510	According to Crown Prince Naruhito this was in order to protect Crown Princess Masako.
SNT.49452.13511	At the same time, Princess Kiko has become the darling of the media while the Crown Princess has been accused of being "selfish" by some newspapers.
SNT.50429.13512	Maher said he was asked by CBS News to appear on the segment.
SNT.50429.13513	But when he asked if he could talk about religion, "that was a dealbreaker from the start".
SNT.50429.13514	Instead, he said they would send over a list of "acceptable topics".
SNT.50429.13515	CBS News executive producer Rome Hartman has since responded in an e-mail to TVNewser saying that, "Bill Maher was never told that he couldn't discuss religion in a Free Speech segment," and added, "In fact, Free Speech has already addressed religion and we expect others will in the future."
SNT.50429.13516	No response from Bill Maher on this statement as of yet.
SNT.80285.13517	To help cancer patients overcoming cancer and finding a bright life, Taiwan Cancer Friends New Life Association invited more than 100 cancer patients and volunteers and held the pre-tour launch of "Passing Through Cancer, Finding Love" Eastern Taiwan Bicycle Tour Challenge from Fugang (Taidong) to ChiShinTam (Seven Star Basin, Hualien) for a new miracle.
SNT.80285.13518	Min-fa Lin (Secretary General of Taiwan Cancer Friends New Life Association) remarked that a cancer patient inspires this tour because the one finished a small bicycle tour from Shihlin to Tamshui, after this event known by governments and companies, Sports Affairs Council of Executive Yuan of Taiwan (SAC) supervised and Giant Co., Ltd. sponsored this Hualien-Taidong tour.
SNT.80285.13519	He also hoped this event will inspire common people finding a bright life from a dark or hopeless life.
SNT.80285.13520	Huang-lang Tsai (Deputy Commissioner of SAC) remarked that SAC promoted public sports in Taiwan for a long period, and SAC respected the participation on disadvantaged people or minority.
SNT.80285.13521	He hoped those disadvantaged people such as handicapped, cancer patients, deaf people can participate sports equally with common people, and also recommended some low-cost sports like long-distance running, walking, and bicycle riding, and hoped people in Taiwan will support "Taiwan Citizen Walking Day" at November 11, 2007.
SNT.80285.13522	After the speech by Tsai, he presented a symbolized flag to a delegate named Tsia-tse Kuo and hoped this trip will succeed.
SNT.80285.13523	This challenging tour will take place at September 23 and 24.
SNT.45174.13524	Nine months after announcing the interoperability between their instant messaging (IM) services, Internet rivals Microsoft and Yahoo! began limited public beta (pre-release) testing of the program.
SNT.45174.13525	This enables users of the two services to communicate with each other using their existing IM client, Microsoft's Windows Live Messenger (formerly MSN Messenger) and Yahoo! Messenger with Voice.
SNT.45174.13526	Users wishing to use the new feature can go to a special page on the service's website, where they have to review and accept an agreement.
SNT.45174.13527	After signing out and signing in again, the interoperability is enabled without downloading any new software.
SNT.45174.13528	The service is designed to allow users to see each others' online presence, view personal status messages, share select emoticons, view offline messages and add new contacts from either service.
SNT.45174.13529	However, more advanced features, like voice calls and shared folders are not interoperable between the two services.

SNT.196934.13531	Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has declared that the National Army is on maximum alert along the Colombian border, after he broke relations with that country on Thursday.
SNT.196934.13532	The declaration comes in the wake of the Colombian Secretary of State's claim before the Organisation of American States (OAS) that the FARC has a "consolidated," "active" and "growing" presence in Venezuela, with some 1500 guerrilla fighters in 87 camps.
SNT.196934.13533	Venezuela's Secretary of Defense Carlos Mata told the media that his forces have been mobilised since Thursday morning, and are awaiting the orders of their Commander in Chief, the President.
SNT.196934.13534	Relations between the two countries had previously been strained, after the Venezuelan government voiced its opposition to new US military bases being set up in Colombia.
SNT.196934.13535	The Colombian ambassador has been given 72 hours to vacate his offices in Caracas.

SNT.13427.13544	A reporter's notes subpoenaed by the U.S. District Court in Washington may show United States President George W. Bush's chief political advisor Karl Rove as one of the two sources behind the leaking of the identity of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame, according to one or more anonymous sources cited by MSNBC.
SNT.13427.13545	However, Rove's lawyer, Donald Luskin, acknowledged that although Rove had communicated with Cooper shortly before Plame's identity was leaked, denied any wrongdoing on the part of his client, saying that "Rove absolutely did not identify Valerie Plame."
SNT.13427.13546	The notes are those of TIME magazine White House correspondent Matthew Cooper.
SNT.13427.13547	They were released by Norman Pearlstine, editor-in-chief of TIME Inc., by order of the court, in ruling that, in the case of leaking the identity of CIA agents, reporters must reveal the identity of their sources.
SNT.13427.13548	The court's ruling was based on the clause in Constitutional law summarized popularly with the phrase "Crying fire in a crowded theater": that when the degree to which the speech puts the safety of others at risk outweighs the degree to which it benefits others, so does their right to safety and security outweigh one's right to free expression.
SNT.13427.13549	The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear the reporters' appeal of the case.
SNT.5454.13550	Nobel Laureate in Physics Hans Bethe died in his home in Ithaca, New York on March 6, 2005, according to Cornell University, where he was professor emeritus of physics.
SNT.5454.13551	Bethe, whose mother was Jewish, fled Germany in 1933 when the Nazi Party came to power.
SNT.5454.13552	Bethe, along with hundreds of other Jewish academics, were fired from their posts as a result of one of Adolf Hitler's first anti-Semitic acts.
SNT.5454.13553	Bethe moved first to England and in 1935 to the USA where he taught at Cornell University.
SNT.5454.13554	Between 1935 and 1938, he studied nuclear reactions and reaction cross sections.
SNT.5454.13555	This research was useful to Bethe in more quantitatively developing Niels Bohr's theory of the compound nucleus.
SNT.5454.13556	During World War II, he served as a prominent member of a special summer session at the University of California, Berkeley at the invitation of Robert Oppenheimer, which outlined the first designs for the atomic bomb and served as the beginning of the Manhattan Project.
SNT.5454.13557	When Oppenheimer started the secret weapons design laboratory, Los Alamos, he appointed Bethe as Director of the Theoretical Division.
SNT.5454.13558	After the war, Bethe argued that a crash project for the hydrogen bomb should not be attempted, though after President Truman announced the beginning of such a crash project, and the outbreak of the Korean War, he signed up and played a key role in the weapon's development.
SNT.5454.13559	In 1968, he reflected upon the choice, noting that "It seemed quite logical."
SNT.5454.13560	"But sometimes I wish I were more consistent an idealist."
SNT.5454.13561	Though he would see the project through to its end, in Bethe's account he was primarily hopeful that the weapon would be impossible to produce.
SNT.5454.13562	He later characterized Stanislaw Ulam was the "father" of the hydrogen bomb, and Edward Teller as its "mother," and himself as its "midwife."
SNT.5454.13563	Among his many honors, Bethe received the Max Planck medal in 1955, and in 1961 he was awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for his work in identifying the energy generating processes in stars.
SNT.5454.13564	In 1967, Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his studies of the production of solar and stellar energy, stellar nucleosynthesis.
SNT.5454.13565	He postulated that the source of this energy are thermonuclear reactions in which hydrogen was converted into helium.
SNT.5454.13566	During the 1980s and 1990s, Bethe campaigned for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, arguing against the nuclear arms race and against nuclear testing.
SNT.5454.13567	In 1995, at the age of 88, Bethe wrote an open letter calling on all scientists to "cease and desist" from working on any aspect of nuclear weapons development and manufacture.
SNT.5454.13568	In 2004, he signed a letter along with 47 other Nobel laureates endorsing John Kerry for president of the United States citing Bush's apparent misuse of science.
SNT.144367.13569	Insurgents in eastern Afghanistan fired rockets into a marketplace on Monday, killing ten civilians in an area where French armed forces were meeting with tribal elders.

SNT.144367.13571	Two rockets hit the market as the commander of French troops in eastern Afghanistan, General Marcel Druart, was meeting tribal chiefs nearby.
SNT.144367.13572	"The Taliban fired the rockets from Badrab, where they have a base."
SNT.144367.13573	"They are strong there," said deputy police chief Haji Mohammed Akbar.
SNT.144367.13574	French and US medical teams evacuated the wounded by helicopter to hospitals for treatment.
SNT.144367.13575	The French commander attended the gathering of tribal elders, known as a "shura," as part of NATO efforts to win the trust of Afghan civilians in a region with a strong Taliban presence.

SNT.116776.13593	The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) said on Monday that repairing the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will cost up to €16.6 million or US$21 million.
SNT.116776.13594	The LHC, which is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator, is located near the border of France and Switzerland and crosses the border four times.
SNT.116776.13595	It is designed to simulate the conditions shortly after the Big Bang, but it broke down on September 19 due to an electrical failure.
SNT.116776.13596	Most of the repair time is covered by previously scheduled maintenance time, and CERN originally hoped to have the machine up and running again by early May.
SNT.116776.13597	However, CERN officials now believe that it may take until the end of July or longer.
SNT.116776.13598	CERN spokesman James Gillies said:
SNT.116776.13598-2	 "If we can do it sooner, all well and good."
SNT.116776.13599	"But I think we can do it realistically by early summer."
SNT.116776.13600	The machine operates at temperatures colder than outer space and must be gradually warmed up for experts to assess the damage, causing much of the delay.
SNT.116776.13601	CERN expects the repair cost to fall within the annual budget for the project.
SNT.42740.13602	Al-Qaeda's second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has released a new videotape.
SNT.42740.13603	During the broadcast, al-Zawahiri talks to the general Muslim population saying, "I call upon them to reject any referendum on Palestine, because Palestine is not for bargaining or bidding."
SNT.42740.13604	"Palestine was a land of Islam, and its liberation is the duty of every Muslim."
SNT.42740.13605	"I call upon Muslims everywhere to support the brothers in Palestine."
SNT.42740.13606	Al-Zawahiri also claims that the United Nations is trying to "occupy" Sudan and is attempting to "divide" the nation.
SNT.42740.13607	"The spineless Sudanese government ... is joining the United States in dividing Sudan to stay in power."
SNT.42740.13608	"In Sudan, the crusader (U.N.) Security Council decided to send military experts to Darfur in preparation for its occupation and division."
SNT.42740.13609	"I call upon every Muslim and everyone who has faith in Sudan, and every fervent Muslim in Darfur to confront the Zionist Crusader plot to occupy the lands of Islam," added al-Zawahiri.
SNT.42740.13610	Zawahiri also talks about judges in Egypt who wish to make the judiciary system independent.
SNT.42740.13611	"In Egypt, the crusader system supports the secular system that violates the judges' integrity, cheats in elections and enforces emergency law."
SNT.42740.13612	"The regime won't give you your independence because to do so would be to kill itself," said Zawahiri, who was addressing the Egyptian judges.
SNT.42740.13613	"You agreed on the constitution and the secular laws imposed on the nation by arms and suppression and torture and rigged elections."
SNT.42740.13614	"I tell the Egyptian judges you will not gain independence because America and Israel simply and clearly do not want that, and what you see today in procedures against you is part of their promised American reform plan," added Zawahiri.
SNT.42740.13615	Zawahiri also talks about the aid to the Palestinian government, which has been frozen.
SNT.42740.13616	"The Arab governments did not have the courage to even meet the Palestinians' needs for one month."
SNT.42740.13617	"Because the orders came from [Washington D.C.] to their agents to starve the Palestinians and to isolate them," added Zawahiri.
SNT.42740.13618	The videotape is approximately 17 minutes long and it is unknown where Aljazeera got the tape.
SNT.112594.13619	Françoise Demulder, the French war photographer who was the first woman to win the World Press Photo of the Year award has died at the age of 61.
SNT.112594.13620	The World Press Photo website says that "Demulder stated at the time that she hated war, but felt compelled to document how it's always the innocent who suffer, while the powerful get richer and richer."
SNT.112594.13621	This is why the organization presented her with the award in 1977.
SNT.112594.13622	During her career Demulder reported on wars in Vietnam, Palestine, Cambodia and Lebanon.
SNT.112594.13623	Her photograph of refugees in Beirut won her the press photography award.
SNT.112594.13624	Jonathan Randall, a Washington Post correspondent who knew Demulder, paid his tributes to the photographer.
SNT.112594.13625	"This was a time when there were beginning to be women correspondents but there were relatively few women photographers," he said.
SNT.112594.13626	"When she won the prize it was really quite something."
SNT.112594.13627	"It showed that women were capable of doing what had hitherto been a man's occupation."

SNT.16274.13646	A Virginia man who allegedly clubbed to death an alligator he hooked while fishing, is under consideration by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Richmond for destroying a "threatened species".
SNT.16274.13647	But according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service web page of delisted species on the Endangered Species Act, the American alligator was removed from the list in 1987.
SNT.16274.13648	The reason cited for its removal was the species had recovered.
SNT.16274.13649	Fisherman Max Belle reportedly used an oar to bring into submission the 44-inch-long, 9 pound creature when he brought it to the boat.
SNT.16274.13650	Belle was fishing on the Chesterfield County Falling Creek Reservoir, where the alligator was first sighted in May.
SNT.16274.13651	An alligator is not a native species in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, and it is thought that it was released by someone who once kept it as a pet.
SNT.16274.13652	U.S.Department of Agriculture (USDA) employee attempts to capture and relocate it were unsuccessful.
SNT.16274.13653	The native habitat of the alligator is in regions of the Southeast, starting from the Carolinas and moving southwards to Texas.
SNT.16274.13654	The fisherman’s attorney, David P. Baugh, said area residents surrounding the reservoir are happy the alligator is gone.
SNT.16274.13655	Referring to the support for Mr. Belle of reservoir neighbors, he said, "... next time they [USDA] will ask to hire Mr. Belle to come catch the alligator."
SNT.16274.13656	His client received a court summons Thursday and is prepared to pay a $300 fine and $50 court costs if he is found guilty of the federal misdemeanor crime.
SNT.16274.13657	It took investigators two weeks to positively identify the toothy crocodile as an American alligator, (Alligator mississippiensis).
SNT.213457.13658	According to a Government Official, four miners are trapped in an Ecuador mine located 250 miles (405 kilometers) southeast of the country's capital, Quito.
SNT.213457.13659	The miners have been trapped since 03:00 (08:00 UTC) local time.
SNT.213457.13660	According to the Under-Secretary of Mining Development, Jorge Espinoza, the men are trapped 500 feet (150 meters) below the surface.
SNT.213457.13661	Rescuers are currently on the scene and they expect to reach the men within 24 hours.
SNT.213457.13662	According to a Government Official, the men are believed to be alive "because they were far enough away from the site of the collapse," however their condition is unknown and rescuers have not been able to make contact with them.
SNT.213457.13663	It is estimated that there is five to six days of breathable air left in the mine.
SNT.213457.13664	The mine is suspected to have collapsed due to a build up of underground water which caused the mine's supports to buckle and collapse, blocking all exits.
SNT.57166.13665	According to the Tribunal spokesman Raed Jouhi, the Iraqi High Tribunal's appeals court in Baghdad confirms the sentence of death against the former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, after a month and a half of trial review.
SNT.57166.13666	According to the CNN, no sentence has been notified to Saddam Hussein yet.
SNT.57166.13667	On November 5, Hussein was sentenced to death for his role in the Dujail massacre in 1982, in which 148 Shiites died.
SNT.57166.13668	According to Iraqi laws, Hussein would be hanged within 30 days, and there is no chance of pardon.

SNT.43286.13685	Former American Idol winner Ruben Studdard has won a lawsuit and $2 million against his ex-manager Ronald W. Edwards and Edwards' promotions company, Sez Inc.
SNT.43286.13686	The lawsuit was for misappropriating the singer's money and credit cards.
SNT.43286.13687	The suit claimed Edwards misused more than $246,000 of the singer's money.
SNT.43286.13688	According to the judge's ruling, Edwards stole money from Studdard's checking and other bank accounts, improperly used his credit cards and even used Studdard's money to repay a $10,000 bank loan.
SNT.43286.13689	Jefferson County Circuit Judge Scott Vowell awarded Studdard $500,000 for actual losses and another $1.5 million in punitive damages.
SNT.43286.13690	Vowell dismissed Edwards' promotions company from the suit because it was bankrupt and had no money or assets.
SNT.43286.13691	Edwards filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 17, 2005.
SNT.43286.13692	Studdard has sold 2.2 million records, but because of the damage done to his credit by Edwards, it is now even hard for Ruben to buy a home, said Vowell.
SNT.25863.13693	The U.S. Senate has adopted an amendment, proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), to a defense bill limiting detainees' court privileges.
SNT.25863.13694	The amendment would make the Combat Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) statutory law, the Annual Review Board (ARB) statutory law, require the designated civilian officer to be a government official who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, not allow the preponderance of evidence against a detainee be derived from undue coercion, and remove Guantanamo prisoners' right to file habeas corpus petitions in federal courts.
SNT.25863.13695	In regards to the habeas corpus provision, the amendment specifically states, "No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien outside the United States (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(38) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38)) who is detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."
SNT.25863.13696	Five Democrats jumped party lines to vote for and four Republicans jumped party lines to vote against the amendment.
SNT.25863.13697	Nine Senators, seven Republicans and two Democrats, did not vote on the amendment.
SNT.25863.13698	Kent Conrad, Mary Landrieu, Joseph Lieberman, Ben Nelson, and Ron Wyden were the Democrats who voted for the amendment.
SNT.25863.13699	Arlen Specter, Lincoln Chafee, Gordon Smith, and John Sununu were the Republicans who voted against the measure.
SNT.25863.13700	Senator Graham is quoted as saying, "The president has established procedures to determine who is an enemy combatant and to annually review their status."
SNT.25863.13701	"It’s now time for Congress to sign-off on these procedures and turn them into a statute, a move the courts will give great deference to."
SNT.25863.13702	It should be noted that under Graham's amendment, detainees would be able to challenge only the narrow question of whether the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense at the time the military determined their status as an enemy combatant were followed.
SNT.25863.13703	The Court of Appeals for the DC circuit would still retain the ability to rule on that question.
SNT.25863.13704	Civil liberties groups as well as human rights groups issued statements opposing the amendment.
SNT.25863.13705	"The Graham amendment will create a thousand points of darkness across the globe where the United States will be free to hold people indefinitely without a hearing and beyond the reach of U.S. law and the checks and balances of the courts enshrined in our Constitution," the Center for Constitutional Rights said in a statement.
SNT.25863.13706	"The Graham amendment would strip all courts, including the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions or any other action challenging any aspect of the detention of foreign detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, except for the narrow question of whether status review boards follow their own rules," said a press release from the American Civil Liberties Union.
SNT.20512.13707	In a last minute change of position, the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) has reversed its decision not to allow the Liberian National football team, The Lone Star, to attend Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Togo.
SNT.20512.13708	The NTGL had announced on Wednesday that the squad would not be able to travel to Lome, Togo because of a lack of funds to pay for the team's travel.
SNT.20512.13709	In a statement explaining its decision not to fund the team's travel, the NTGL highlighted more pressing financial obligations such as the country's upcoming national elections and the demobilization of the nation's defunct armed forces.
SNT.20512.13710	"As a result of the huge expenditure, the National Transitional Government of Liberia has decided it is unfeasible to underwrite the Lone Star's travel to Togo," said the Minister of Information, Dr. C. William Allen.
SNT.20512.13711	The decision to allow The Lone Star to travel to Lome was made after the price of the team's travel decreased from US$31,000 to US$18,000.
SNT.20512.13712	The team now plans to fly to Accra and take a bus to Lome versus fly the entire way.
SNT.20512.13713	Had Liberia failed to take the field on Sunday, the country would have faced fines of US$31,895 and possible prohibition from participating in the 2010 World Cup to be held in South Africa.
SNT.20512.13714	Incidentally, the fines would have been slightly more than the team's original travel budget.
SNT.38472.13715	An Islamic militant web forum has released a videotape of Al-Qaeda's second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who reportedly released the tape to commemorate the battle of Tora Bora in December 2001.
SNT.38472.13716	Zawahiri has made at least three other tapes since November, all of which were broadcast by Al-Jazeera.
SNT.38472.13717	He appeared in two tapes in January, and in one tape on March 4, 2006.
SNT.38472.13718	The latest video was not released immediately after the date it was allegedly filmed, nor has Al-Jazeera yet broadcast the video by Zawahiri despite having broadcast his three previous tapes.
SNT.38472.13719	Al-Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden, released an audio tape on January 19, 2006.
SNT.38472.13720	Parts of that tape were aired on Al-Jazeera and it was the first time in over a year that Bin Laden had been heard.
SNT.9821.13721	By a majority of 378 to 262, Members of the European Parliament have voted to abolish the right of European Union countries to opt out of Working Time Directive.
SNT.9821.13722	If the Council of Ministers agrees, the right to opt out of the directive will be phased out over a period of three years.
SNT.9821.13723	Under the "derogation" provision of the directive, individual workers can waive the right to work no more than 48 hours per week.
SNT.9821.13724	Among the member states, only the United Kingdom uses this provision.
SNT.62582.13725	The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) announced today that computer systems involved with the processing of tax returns for individuals are back online.
SNT.62582.13726	Tax processing had been halted on March 6, 2007, due to a computer glitch.
SNT.62582.13727	The source of the problem had been traced back to software maintenance performed on March 4.
SNT.62582.13728	In an update on the CRA website, dated March 14, Michel Dorais, Commissioner of the Agency, stated that all of the databases had been restored and CRA employees are processing the backlog of returns and payments.
SNT.62582.13729	Tax processing for businesses had not been affected by the computer shutdown.
SNT.62582.13730	In his statement, Dorais thanked taxpayers "for their patience and understanding" during the service outage.
SNT.62582.13731	He also stated that "the integrity and safety of personal data was never at risk".
SNT.62582.13732	The CRA suggests that it would work quickly to process the resulting backlog of tax returns.
SNT.250062.13733	According to analysts, the major earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit on Friday is likely to have major economic impacts within Japan, though the global economy is unlikely to be significantly affected.
SNT.250062.13734	The overall negative impact of the earthquake on Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to be only a few tenths of one percent, though that is expected to be enough to push Japan's expected recovery from its current economic slump back by several months.
SNT.250062.13735	It added that most of the economic effects of the quake will probably be felt early this summer.
SNT.250062.13736	To fund the current rescue efforts, the Japanese government is reportedly considering raising taxes, as the estimated cost of rebuilding affected areas is as high as one percent of the total five trillion dollar GDP.
SNT.250062.13737	Japan currently carries high levels of debt, estimated to be about ten trillion dollars, which is expected to make additional government spending for rebuilding efforts difficult.
SNT.250062.13738	The Japanese stock market index Nikkei 225 dropped 1.7% at the end of the day Friday; it closed fourteen minutes after the quake and tsunami struck.
SNT.250062.13739	Beginning on Monday, when trading resumes, the Bank of Japan is, according to its governor, prepared to inject money into the economy in order to stabilize the markets.
SNT.107249.13740	12 firefighters in Buffalo, New York, United States have been taken to the hospital where they are being treated for smoke and chemical inhalation after a massive fire broke out at a warehouse on Buffalo's west side, early Monday morning.
SNT.107249.13741	At least three fire companies started battling the blaze, which engulfed the entire warehouse, sending a plume of smoke into the air which could be seen for several miles, at one point darkening the sky.
SNT.107249.13742	All 12 firefighters are being treated at Erie County Medical Center, but their conditions are not known.
SNT.107249.13743	At least 80 firefighters were reported to be on scene along with a total of nine of the 19 fire companies in Buffalo.
SNT.107249.13744	Firefighters were still on scene as of 9:15 a.m. EDT (UTC-4) today, nearly 24 hours after the fire started.
SNT.107249.13745	The fire started at the Leisure Living Pool Supplies warehouse at 1130 Niagara street between West Ferry and Albany streets behind the Rich Products building at around 10:30 a.m. Monday and was not brought under control until 6:30 a.m. today.
SNT.107249.13746	Firefighters had the fire under control just before 12:00 p.m. Monday, but wind off Lake Erie reignited the fire at around 3:00 p.m.
SNT.107249.13747	At around 7:00 p.m., most of the blaze was under control, but smoke could still be seen coming from the building.
SNT.107249.13748	All employees from both Rich's and the chemical company have been sent home for the day and made it out safely.
SNT.107249.13749	The building is owned by PoolSupplies.com which is a division of Leisure Living, selling supplies, recreation and chemicals for swimming pools.
SNT.107249.13750	At 9:00 p.m., firefighters reported that most of the fire was contained under the collapsed portions of the building, but around 10:00 p.m. firefighters reported that more thick black smoke started to rise from the building.
SNT.107249.13751	Black smoke usually indicates burning, whereas white smoke often indicates water putting out a fire.
SNT.107249.13752	Firefighters are using a helicopter, courtesy of the Erie County Sheriff's Department, that is equipped with infrared cameras in order to see the areas of the building which still contain a significant amount of heat or fire.
SNT.107249.13753	After having fought the fire for over 24 hours, fire officials stated that the fire was mostly extinguished and ordered fire companies to start shutting down the hoses and pack up their equipment.
SNT.107249.13754	Just before 1:00 p.m. the fire command post stated that fire investigators were on scene and that "they can call us (firefighters) back if they need anything."
SNT.107249.13755	Officials have urged all residents near the blaze to stay indoors and to shut all windows and doors due to the smoke which has been blowing close to the ground.
SNT.107249.13756	At least one civilian who was inside a park at the foot of Ferry was also taken to the hospital for smoke and chemical inhalation.
SNT.107249.13757	Officials were able to evacuate the park and no other injuries were reported.
SNT.107249.13758	At one point, the sun was blocked by the black smoke rising from the building.
SNT.107249.13759	It appears it reignited due to the earlier collapse of the roof and the winds off the lake.
SNT.107249.13760	"Right now, one thing fire officials would like to get out and stress is anyone in and around the Niagara and Ferry area, if you could please go indoors, and shut your doors," stated Michael DeGeorge, a spokesman for the Buffalo Police Department, to reporters.
SNT.107249.13761	The northbound lane of the I-190 expressway, which lies just to the west of the warehouse, was closed at the Porter Street exit at the Peace Bridge to the exit leading to the 198 expressway for several hours.
SNT.107249.13762	At 11:15 p.m., firefighters stated they would begin to reopen the lane.
SNT.107249.13763	Niagara street from Albany to West Ferry reopened to normal traffic in the late morning hours of Tuesday.
SNT.107249.13764	Throughout Monday afternoon and early evening, employees of Marco's Restaurant on Niagara and Albany were providing ice and beverages to firefighters and police officers who were on scene.
SNT.107249.13765	Temperatures were quite warm, in the upper 70's (F), with winds gusting to nearly 15-20 MPH, coming out of the southwest.
SNT.107249.13766	Although the wind assisted in reigniting the fire, it also assisted firefighters by quickly clearing the area of smoke.
SNT.107249.13767	The warehouse is a storage and distribution facility for pool chemicals, especially chlorine.
SNT.107249.13768	Chemical drops could be felt flying through the air, which also had the smell of bleach.
SNT.107249.13769	According to a source who spoke to Wikinews on condition of anonymity, the warehouse contained over US$8 million in supplies and chemicals.
SNT.107249.13770	Earlier tests performed on the air by firefighters and Haz-mat officials had shown that the smoke and fumes rising from the fire are not dangerous or toxic.
SNT.107249.13771	Further tests were performed, but those results are not yet known and officials don't believe there was any danger to the air.
SNT.107249.13772	Officials will testing the water runoff from fire hoses to make sure that it is not contaminated as it is emptying into the Niagara River.
SNT.107249.13773	The warehouse is located just down stream from a drinking water pumping station with several more scattered along the River from Buffalo to Niagara Falls.
SNT.107249.13774	The cause of the fire is not known and is under investigation.
SNT.107249.13775	Last year, on May 14, 2007, at least five buildings that were part of a warehouse complex about 1/3 of a mile from Leisure caught fire, and required nearly 130 firefighters to battle the blaze.
SNT.107249.13776	Smoke from that fire was seen over 40 miles away.
SNT.51058.13777	Instead of returning to practise from a fractured finger today as scheduled, flamboyant Dallas Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens is instead recovering at Baylor Medical Center this morning from an apparent suicide attempt last night.
SNT.51058.13778	A female friend who was with Owens last night observed him taking several prescription pain killers and behaving erratically.
SNT.51058.13779	She called 911 and Owens was rushed to the hospital.
SNT.51058.13780	Original reports stated that Owens was suffering from an adverse reaction to the pain medication, which he was taking for a fractured hand.
SNT.51058.13781	But this morning, Dallas police have reported that Owens took an unknown large amount of the pills, and when asked by police this morning if he had been attempting to hurt himself, Owens replied, "Yes."
SNT.51058.13782	Paramedics have only confirmed that they called police to report that they were bringing Owens to hospital.
SNT.51058.13783	Owens has since said that he was not attempting suicide.
SNT.120618.13784	On February 4, 2009 in an attempt to keep MySpace safe for young users, MySpace officials stated that they have removed 90,000 sex offender accounts from their website.
SNT.120618.13785	The social networking site admitted this is double what they anticipated last year.
SNT.120618.13786	MySpace previously thought the site had 40,000 offender accounts registered.
SNT.120618.13787	North Carolina attorney general Roy Cooper and Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal stated that they encourage and seek more social networking sites like MySpace to become safer.
SNT.120618.13788	After the MySpace team calculated the number of sex offenders on their website they submitted the numbers to both attorneys on Tuesday February 3.
SNT.120618.13789	"This shocking revelation, resulting from our subpoena, provides compelling proof that social networking sites remain rife with sexual predators," said Blumenthal.
SNT.120618.13790	Both attorneys work with Facebook and MySpace in an agreement to make their social networking websites safer, especially for young users.
SNT.120618.13791	They have already made both websites safer by implementing dozens of safeguards and a special features where users older than the age of 18 have limitations searching users less than 18 years of age.
SNT.294924.13792	120 years after it was founded, the University of Wales (UoW) will shut down.
SNT.294924.13793	Already comprised of several institutions, two will merge fully while two more will become independent universities.
SNT.294924.13794	With a charter from 1893 and the Prince of Wales as its chancellor, problems began at UoW last year after concerns the head of a Malaysian partner institution, a local pop artist, had non-legitimate qualifications. 
SNT.294924.13795	This was followed by Thailand's authorities denouncing another UoW partner as illegal, then an investigation in the UK into all the UoW's foreign ties.
SNT.294924.13796	The Quality Assurance Agency said UoW's overseas checks on foreign institutions were inadequate. 
SNT.294924.13797	The UK Border Agency is investigating a possible visa scam whereby foreign students were sold exam answers for a qualification leading to UoW entry and British visas. 
SNT.294924.13798	Two colleges — Rayat London College and Lampton College — are suspended over the claims.
SNT.294924.13799	Trinity St David and Swansea Metropolitan universities are to merge, forming University of Wales: Trinity St David.
SNT.294924.13800	It is to use the latter's own royal charter, which is itself 190 years old.
SNT.294924.13801	Newport and Glyndwr are set to become universities in their own right.
SNT.294924.13802	The dissolution follows calls from the leaders of rival universities for the end of UoW.
SNT.294924.13803	"I warmly welcome the historic decision taken today by the University of Wales Council," said UoW Vice-Chancellor Professor Medwin Hughes, who will fill the same role for the new University of Wales: Trinity St David.
SNT.294924.13804	The Prince of Wales is among past students, having spent a 1969 term there.
SNT.294924.13805	The institution's various member organisations at one point included the now-separate Cardiff University.
SNT.2948.13806	Rabies is a disease that has no cure and nearly everyone it infects is dead just two weeks after the symptoms show.
SNT.2948.13807	And yet, last week a teenage girl named Jeanna Giese was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated.
SNT.2948.13808	She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.
SNT.2948.13809	On September 12, 2004, Jeanna — a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin— was bitten by a bat while attending church.
SNT.2948.13810	By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later.
SNT.2948.13811	Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear.
SNT.2948.13812	In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment.
SNT.2948.13813	Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.
SNT.2948.13814	By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine.
SNT.2948.13815	She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement.
SNT.2948.13816	Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.
SNT.2948.13817	The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human.
SNT.2948.13818	Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared.
SNT.26984.13819	Stan Berenstain, co-creator of the popular Berenstain Bears children's books, has died due to complications from cancer at age 82.
SNT.26984.13820	Along with his wife, Jan Berenstain, Stan and Jan Berenstain published over 200 books aimed at teaching children to read and helping them with lessons such as sharing, new siblings.
SNT.26984.13821	The first Berenstain Bears book was published in 1962 and titled "The Big Honey Hunt".
SNT.26984.13822	With the help of head of children's publishing at Random House, author Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, the Berenstains created a franchise that drew millions of young readers.
SNT.26984.13823	Until 1997, when they hired an employee to run the company's computer, Mr. Berenstain and his family managed the entire ursine enterprise, which has branched out into two television series, videos, stage musicals, toys, cereal and other products.
SNT.26984.13824	According to an interview of the Berenstain Bears official website, Papa Bear is based on Stan, Mama on Jan; Stan clarifies that he's "not as stupid" as Papa.
SNT.26984.13825	Stan fed his interest in drawing as a child, by drawing on paper bags and cardboard.
SNT.65593.13826	The shooter in the Virginia Tech university shootings has been identified as Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year old South Korean national.
SNT.65593.13827	He was studying English and lived on the university campus.
SNT.65593.13828	The President of Virginia Tech, Charles Steger said in an interview that the "possibility exists" that more than one gunman was involved.
SNT.65593.13829	"It appears that the second shooter was a resident in our dormitory... it appears he was an on-campus resident," Steger said.
SNT.65593.13830	Ballistic reports confirm that the same gun was used in both instances of the campus shootings, but police could not confirm if the shooter was the same.
SNT.65593.13831	The shootings on Monday were in two separate locations, and occurred two hours apart.
SNT.65593.13832	The first took place at 07:15 (12:15 UTC), at West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory.
SNT.65593.13833	Then, at about 09:15 (14:15 UTC), 30 people were killed in the second shooting, about half a mile (800 metres) from the first at the Norris Hall classroom building, on the same campus.
SNT.65593.13834	Bodies were found in four classrooms and a stairwell, according to Virginia state police superintendent Col. Steve Flaherty.
SNT.65593.13835	Some students complained that they had received no warning from the university until an e-mail alert sent more than two hours after the first incident.
SNT.65593.13836	The university has suspended classroom courses for one week, and Norris Hall will remain closed for the rest of the semester.
SNT.65593.13837	University officials have expressed an interest in developing a text messaging alert system where persons can add their phone number to a list for notification in the event that incidents may warrant the use of caution or extra attention.
SNT.65593.13838	In a reaction to the school massacre, the gun control group Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence asks for "common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur".
SNT.65593.13839	The New York Times ran an editorial with a similar message for gun control.
SNT.104603.13840	In a unanimous 95-0 vote Thursday, the United States Senate passed a bill that would forbid employers and health insurance companies from discriminating against someone based on information learned through genetic testing.
SNT.104603.13841	The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, described by Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy as "the first major new civil rights bill of the new century," will now be sent back to the House of Representatives, where it could be approved as early as next week.
SNT.104603.13842	President George W. Bush, who would have to sign the bill for it to become law, has voiced his support for the legislation.
SNT.104603.13843	The bill forbids employers from firing, refusing to hire, or otherwise discriminating against employees based on genetic information, such as a family history of a hereditary disease.
SNT.104603.13844	It also makes it illegal for employers to request genetic information of an employee or the employee's family.
SNT.104603.13845	Health insurance companies are also addressed in the bill, which forbids them from requesting genetic information or using such information to set premium rates or determine enrollment eligibility.
SNT.104603.13846	However, insurance companies would still have the right to base one's health coverage on the actual presence of a genetic disease.
SNT.104603.13847	"For the first time we act to prevent discrimination before it has taken firm hold and that's why this legislation is unique and groundbreaking," said Maine Senator Olympia Snowe, who sponsored the bill along with Sen. Kennedy and Sen. Mike Enzi.
SNT.104603.13848	Snowe fears the threat of discrimination may discourage people from undergoing genetic testing, which can help to diagnose a wide range of diseases and lead to lifesaving therapy.
SNT.104603.13849	Kathy Hudson, director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center, reports that 92 percent are worried that information gained in genetic testing may be used against them.
SNT.104603.13850	"After a very long wait," she says, "Americans can now be confident that their genetic information cannot be used by health insurers or employers in harmful or hurtful ways."
SNT.104603.13851	"Federal legislation establishing a national and uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination," the bill reads, "thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, and new therapies."
SNT.104603.13852	Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn initially blocked Senate action on the bill, warning that it could potentially lead to excessive lawsuits against employers and insurers.
SNT.104603.13853	But after changes were made to the bill to ease his concerns earlier this week, he supported the legislation and allowed the Senate to vote on it.
SNT.104603.13854	"We certainly improved the bill from a liability standpoint," said Coburn, an obstetrician.
SNT.104603.13855	Similar bills were unanimously passed by the Senate in 2003 and 2005, but in both years the bill stalled in the House.
SNT.104603.13856	The current bill was passed in the House of Representatives a year ago by a 420-3 vote.
SNT.104603.13857	A genetic nondiscrimination bill was first introduced 13 years ago by New York Representatives Louise Slaughter, who says the House will "get it out to the White House as quickly as we can."
SNT.18583.13858	U.S. Dept. of Justice attorney for 40 years, Dave Margolis, was assigned by James Comey on August 12 to take over his position as the acting Deputy Attorney General.
SNT.18583.13859	The former assistant deputy replaces Comey as the acting boss of Patrick Fitzgerald, the lead prosecutor of the Plame CIA leak case.
SNT.18583.13860	Comey left the post for the private sector as general council for Lockheed Martin Corp.
SNT.18583.13861	Navy Lt. Commander (who testified for Kerry's Iran-Contra hearings) alleges that when David Margolis was the Domestic Criminal Section Chief, he helped limit the liability of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush in the Iran-Contra affair.
SNT.18583.13862	Martin is also on record as having alleged that Margolis was part of a "restricted access group" known as RAG-1, which "was first to develop and then to coordinate the CIA's policy of trafficking in narcotics on a large-scale basis, in order to produce ongoing covert revenue streams pursuant to the aid and sustenance of illegal operations of state," according to Martin.
SNT.18583.13863	The Comey departure, without Margolis stepping in, would have left two key posts at the Justice Department unfilled.
SNT.18583.13864	The head of the Criminal Justice, formerly occupied by Christopher Wray, has been empty since May.
SNT.18583.13865	Flanigan is facing tough questioning during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process.
SNT.18583.13866	Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) said he is unsure whether he would vote for his confirmation.
SNT.18583.13867	Flanigan's role in the aggressive interrogation techniques used on detainees from Afghanistan and Iraq and his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff are being probed.
SNT.66030.13868	An F/A-18 Hornet jet belonging to the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels squadron crashed in Beaufort, South Carolina Saturday.
SNT.66030.13869	The pilot was killed while flying during an air-show at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort.
SNT.66030.13870	The crash occurred approximately three miles beyond the air station near Pine Grove and White Pine roads, in Beaufort.
SNT.66030.13871	According to a Navy news release, the Blue Angels were performing the final maneuver of their routine when the accident occurred.
SNT.66030.13872	"It was [the pilot's] second year on the team, and first year as a demonstration pilot."
SNT.66030.13873	"The other five Blue Angel jets were not involved in the incident."
SNT.66030.13874	The cause of the accident is under investigation, but no other jets are said to be involved.
SNT.66030.13875	In a news conference, Lt. Commander Anthony Walley said "Our squadron, and the entire U.S. Navy, are grieving the loss of a great American, a great naval officer, and most of all, a great friend."
SNT.66030.13876	The pilot's name has not officially been released, but it is believed to be Lt. Commander Kevin Davis, 32, from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, as local media reports the number 6 jet was the one that crashed.
SNT.9578.13877	Germany will lend Albania €16.7 million (USD21.5 million) as part of a loan in order to help the country improve its water supply networks in two southeastern towns, Pogradec and Korca.
SNT.9578.13878	The deal was signed last Tuesday between the Albanian Finance Ministry and Germany's government-owned KfW Bank.
SNT.9578.13879	Germany has been one of the most significant donors to Albania since the fall of Communism.
SNT.9578.13880	In total, it has contributed more than €326 million to the country's development, while investing €135 million in its water supply and urban canals.
SNT.28359.13881	Survivors of the London Bombings have urged the British public to write to their MPs, and set up an online petition calling for an independent Public Inquiry into the attacks.
SNT.28359.13882	52 people were killed and hundreds more injured on July 7th 2005 when four suicide bombers blew themselves up on three separate London Underground trains and a public bus.
SNT.28359.13883	Earlier this week the British government rejected calls for a Public Inquiry, arguing that such an investigation would be too expensive, take too long, and be a distraction from their efforts to combat terrorism.
SNT.28359.13884	Instead, the government has offered to put together a "narrative of events".
SNT.28359.13885	But survivors of the attack argue that a fully comprehensive investigation could teach valuable lessons which may help reduce the likelihood of future attacks, and improve the response capabilities of the emergency services.
SNT.28359.13886	Some survivors, such as Rachel North (a pseudonym), who has been active in organising a support group for her fellow victims, have been angered by the government's alternative proposal of a "narrative".
SNT.28359.13887	Writing on the weblog she started to help her, and others, come to terms with the aftermath of July 7th, Ms North says:
SNT.28359.13888	"Even if you don't like the questions, don't like the answers, think you know the answers already, Mr Blair, it is us, not you, who are paying the cost for this…"
SNT.28359.13889	"If the cost of answering questions makes you squirm, then too bad..."
SNT.28359.13890	"We run the risks on the trains, the buses, the streets each day…"
SNT.28359.13891	"How dare you presume you know our questions and how dare you presume that they can be answered by a 'narrative of what happened', as if we are children to be placated with a story."
SNT.28359.13892	"We are constantly reminded that this is the worst peace time bombing London has ever seen, for something that bad there should be an inquiry."
SNT.28359.13893	"People died, families lost someone they loved and hundreds are still suffering."
SNT.28359.13894	"You can't put a price on that but apparently the government can."
SNT.28359.13895	"If nothing else, an enquiry would make sure some of these lessons were learnt in case, God forbid, anything like this happened again."
SNT.28359.13896	"I thought there were plans in place for emergencies such as this."
SNT.28359.13897	"Whilst the emergency services did a fantastic job on the day, I have been stunningly underwhelmed by the support offered to victims since."
SNT.28359.13898	"An anonymous survivor, writing on the 'Yorkshire lass' website, says:"
SNT.28359.13899	"'When I watched the Al-Qaeda video declaring Jihad against the UK I was haunted by the familiarity of the voice, it was my voice, my accent, my dialect."
SNT.28359.13900	"This is not a man who was recruited and trained in some far off country that I have barely heard of, this was a man who was recruited and trained while he lived 20 minutes from my mother's home where I was born and raised."
SNT.28359.13900-2	"The words he spoke of are words similar to what I have heard many times from disillusioned young men that I studied for my A Levels with."
SNT.28359.13901	"They are the words of hatred I overheard when I worked as a support worker at my local college."
SNT.28359.13902	"They were words of students who were educated... when someone follows through with the actions of those opinions to the detriment of others, questions need to be asked why preventions were not put in place and this needs to be done by public inquiry for peace of mind."
SNT.28359.13902-2	"I have been told that I am looking for justice in the wrong place and in some way that is right."
SNT.28359.13903	"However, I want some sort of justice, some manner of peace of mind, some questions answered and resolutions made."
SNT.28359.13904	"I don't want others to have to go through what myself and hundreds of other commuters did on that Summer's day."
SNT.28359.13905	Quoted on the BBC's website, Saba Mozakka, the daughter of Behnaz Mozakka,who died in the Piccadilly Line explosion, said:
SNT.28359.13906	"The families will be campaigning for there to be a full public inquiry..."
SNT.28359.13907	The survivors' petition has so far gathered over 100 signatures.
SNT.46351.13908	The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution today demanding Iran halt all "enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development" before August 31.
SNT.46351.13909	The resolution was passed under Article 40, Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which sets the stage for possible economic sanctions if Iran does not comply with the resolution, but does not authorise military action.
SNT.46351.13910	The resolution, number 1696, was drafted by the permanent five members of the council and was passed by a 14-1 vote, with Qatar, the only Arab member of the council voting against.
SNT.46351.13911	The resolution expressed "serious concern" at Iran's non-compliance with the IAEA's demand to halt enrichment and other activities and asked the IAEA director to report on Iran's compliance by the end of August.
SNT.46351.13912	This is the first legally binding demand on Iran to halt enrichment work, and the first to suggest possible sanctions.
SNT.46351.13913	The resolution says that "appropriate measures" will be taken if Iran does not comply, but does not explicitly state any threat of sancions.
SNT.46351.13914	Iran's ambassador to the UN, Javad Zarif told the Reuters news agency, "Iran's peaceful nuclear programme poses no threat to international peace and security and therefore dealing with this issue in the Security Council is unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility,"
SNT.46351.13915	Valery Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN said the deadline was meant to meet Iran's request to allow it to consider an offer made in June by the permanent five and Germany, offering Iran a "package" of sops in return for giving up enrichment activities.
SNT.6188.13916	The trial against internet file-sharing network Kazaa in Sydney, Australia, is coming to an end, as closing arguments began today.
SNT.6188.13917	Kazaa pleaded it could not be held responsible for the copyright infringements perpetrated by its users, as it cannot control how the software is used.
SNT.6188.13918	The peer-to-peer distribution software and its owner, Sharman Networks Ltd. and its directors were sued by a group of Australian record labels for copyright infringements by the network's estimated 100 million members worldwide.
SNT.6188.13919	Members of the software share music files with each other, and download up to three billion songs and music files monthly.
SNT.6188.13920	The music industry claims it has lost millions of dollars in unpaid royalties as a result.
SNT.6188.13921	Lawyer Tony Meagher argued that Sharman is no more responsible for the uses of its software than the designers of the photocopiers and video recorders were responsible for the illegal copying of materials on those machines.
SNT.6188.13922	The remaining question is whether Kazaa authorises its users to download files illegally.
SNT.6188.13923	"We tell these users in our Web site and we tell them in our license that they cannot use this (software) for infringing copyright," Meagher told Judge Murray Wilcox.
SNT.6188.13924	By consenting to this license by users, Kazaa is exempted from responsibility.
SNT.6188.13925	The record industry claims Kazaa not only enables but encourages copyright infringement.
SNT.6188.13926	Record industry lawyer Tony Bannon argued that as Kazaa collected information from its users through spyware and sold it to advertisers, the company's claim that it had no control over the software was "completely mind boggling."
SNT.6188.13927	This is not the first trial against Kazaa, and other programs of its kind.
SNT.6188.13928	In August last year, Judge Stephen Wilson ruled that the distribution by Grokster and Morpheus of peer-to-peer software does not violate U.S. copyright law.
SNT.6188.13929	Rod Dorman, lead trial council for Sharman Networks in the U.S., said, "As a result of this decision, Sharman Networks will be filing a motion for summary judgement, nearly identical to the successful motions filed by Grokster and Morpheus, and we are confident that Judge Wilson will find that our product, Kazaa, is a lawful product as well."
SNT.6188.13930	However, the ruling held no precedential effect in the Australian trial, as the principles differed.
SNT.6188.13931	Kazaa and the FastTrack protocol are the brainchild of the Scandinavians Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis, and were introduced in March 2001 by their Dutch company Consumer Empowerment.
SNT.6188.13932	It appeared during the end of the first generation of P2P networks.
SNT.146168.13933	A second day of winter weather and snow has caused further disruption in the UK.
SNT.146168.13934	At 15:13 GMT last Saturday, one Wikinews contributor in West Lothian described the conditions there as 'white-out', although later conditions were reported to have improved.
SNT.146168.13935	Forecasters had indicated further snow in Scotland later into Saturday evening, with some higher ground experiencing as much as 15 centimetres into Sunday.
SNT.146168.13936	Heavy snow for parts of Northern England had also been forecast.
SNT.146168.13937	In South of England the wintry weather has also affected cross channel services, with Operation Stack being brought into effect due to issues at the Port of Calais.
SNT.146168.13938	Eurostar and Channel tunnel services were also disrupted for an extended period, when trains broke down temporarily stranding at least 2000 passengers according to both BBC and Guardian reports.
SNT.146168.13939	The cause is still under investigation, but it has been suggested, temperatures changes on entering the Channel tunnel may have been responsible.
SNT.146168.13940	In addition to transport disruption, a number of sports have been affected.
SNT.146168.13941	At least twenty football fixtures across the UK have been postponed, with some rugby matches also affected.
SNT.146168.13942	Race meetings at Haydock, Newcastle were cancelled due to the conditions, a planned meet at Ascot having been abandoned earlier.
SNT.146168.13943	A National Hunt meeting at Carlisle yesterday was also abandoned.
SNT.7922.13944	In July 2004, Romania will revalue its currency, the leu, so that 10,000 old lei will equal 1 new leu, with 1 euro being equal to approximately 3.6 new lei.
SNT.7922.13945	Dual pricing, in both the old leu and the new leu, has already been introduced from March 2005.
SNT.7922.13946	The transition to the new leu is expected to stabilise the Romanian currency and prepare the country for euro adoption.
SNT.7922.13947	In Romania's case, the adoption will take place 5-7 years after accession in 2007.
SNT.112549.13948	Technology company Sony has recalled 440,000 Vaio laptops due to a fault in the wiring which could result in overheating.
SNT.112549.13949	The recall involves some laptops in the VAIO VGN-TZ100 series, VGN-TZ200 series, VGN-TZ300 series and VGN-TZ2000.
SNT.112549.13950	The affected laptops were sold through the SonyStyle store for between CAN$1,700 and CAN$4,000.
SNT.112549.13951	The recall affects 48 countries, with 373,000 of the recalled laptops being sold in countries other than Japan.
SNT.112549.13952	Sony has received 209 reports of overheating worldwide, and one customer has reported receiving minor burns.
SNT.112549.13953	One of the countries not affected by the recall is the United Kingdom.
SNT.112549.13954	A spokesperson for Sony UK said that there have "been no reported incidents of this potential issue in products sold in the UK to date, and a product recall is not required."
SNT.39901.13955	Fans of quirky numbers everywhere celebrated recently as the clock struck 01:02:03, 04/05/06 (using the DD/MM/YY date convention).
SNT.39901.13956	This once-in-a-century event was highlighted in advance by webloggers and websites such as Boing Boing.
SNT.39901.13957	For countries where the MM/DD/YY convention is more common, the event happened a month ago on 5th April.
SNT.39901.13958	The date attracted numerous comments when posted to the news website Digg, and the special date has been mentioned by hundreds of thousands of websites, according to a Google search.
SNT.39901.13959	Whilst 01:02:03, 04/05/06 won't happen again for another hundred years, those who missed out might want to celebrate 06:06:06, 06/06/06 in just over a month's time, unless you're a hexakosioihexekontahexaphobic.
SNT.63075.13960	The Greek ministries of Public Order and Economy announced that they offer the amount of 800,000 euros to those who will submit information that could help authorities in the fight against local terrorism.
SNT.63075.13961	More specifically, as Greek police stated, everybody who has information about the Revolutionary Struggle (ELA) terrorist far-left organization, can call (within Greece) the police numbers, 170 and 1014.
SNT.63075.13962	This effort by the Greek government has been fully supported by the Embassy of the United States in Athens which, in a statement, announced that offers up to $1 million to those who will significantly help towards the capture of terrorists.
SNT.63075.13963	As the Embassy stated, "you can help bring terrorists to justice and save lives by providing valuable information to resolve past acts of terrorism or prevent future ones".
SNT.63075.13964	The Revolutionary Struggle is regarded as a spinoff of the notorious terrorist group November 17th; the members of which were captured in 2003.
SNT.63075.13965	ELA took responsibility for a rocket attack against the US Embassy in Athens, on January 12, 2007.
SNT.43032.13966	The Entertainment Software Association president Douglas Lowenstein confirmed speculations that his group is planning to file a lawsuit against the state of Oklahoma because of a new law, HB3004.
SNT.43032.13967	Under this law, games that have "inappropriate violence" are added to a list of materials that are considered harmful to minors.
SNT.43032.13968	Lowenstein said that the ESA believes "HB3004 will restrict the First Amendment rights of Oklahoma's citizens and intend to file suit in Oklahoma federal district court shortly, asking that the state's new video game law be overturned."
SNT.43032.13969	Similar laws have been found unconstitutional in St. Louis, Indianapolis, Washington, Illinois, and Michigan.
SNT.43032.13970	A California video game law is currently being reviewed in federal court.
SNT.43032.13971	Last week, a Minnesota law was passed fining minors $25 for purchasing games rated "mature" or "adults only".
SNT.115160.13972	Classified memos have revealed that the Bush administration knowingly endorsed enhanced interrogation techniques including waterboarding and other methods, that critics call torture, for use against terror suspects.
SNT.115160.13973	The memos were issued to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 as classified documents in response to the department's former director George Tenet's request for White House approval.
SNT.115160.13974	"The CIA believed then, and now, that the program was useful and helped save lives," commented a former CIA official, explaining the memos.
SNT.115160.13975	"But in the agency's view, it was like this:"
SNT.115160.13975-2	We don't want to continue unless you tell us in writing that it's not only legal but is the policy of the administration'.
SNT.115160.13976	In private meetings led by then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, top administration officials Vice President Cheney, Attorney General Ashcroft and several former members of the administration discussed the endorsement of the programs.
SNT.115160.13977	No one at the meetings had questioned the methods because the CIA had them "boxed in", a former official noted.
SNT.115160.13978	"They were saying, 'It's the only way to get the information we needed, and — by the way — we think there's another attack coming up'."
SNT.115160.13979	Another official, however, called the idea that the CIA had coerced the Bush administration into approving the torture methods "ridiculous".
SNT.115160.13980	The CIA, he said, understood the methods were "controversial and would be widely criticized if it became public".
SNT.115160.13981	Tenet said that in a 2001 meeting with top administration officials, Rice had warned those attending of an impending attack by a top Al-Qaeda suspect, Abu Zubaydah.
SNT.115160.13982	Bush had asked a CIA staffer if the methods really worked.
SNT.115160.13983	Ashcroft had commented during the meetings that "history will not judge us kindly".
SNT.115160.13984	Last month, Rice stated that there was concern over the legality of the program and that she was investigating if any laws had been broken.
SNT.53142.13985	The annual Living Planet Report compiled by the Zoological Society of London and the Global Footprint Network, published this week by WWF International, assessed "the health of the planet's ecosystems" and measured the demands people make on the planet's resources.
SNT.53142.13986	The Living Planet Index is based on population trends between 1970 and 2003 of over 3 600 populations of more than 1 300 vertebrate species from around the world.
SNT.53142.13987	There has been an overall decline of around 30 per cent over the 33-year period.
SNT.53142.13988	Tropical species populations declined by around 55 per cent on average from 1970 to 2003, while temperate species populations, have shown little overall change.
SNT.53142.13989	The Ecological Footprint measures the area of biologically productive land and sea required to sustian humanity.
SNT.53142.13990	In 2003 this was 14.1 billion global hectares, or 2.2 global hectares per person (a global hectare is a hectare with world-average ability to produce resources and absorb wastes).
SNT.53142.13991	The total supply of productive area, or biocapacity, in 2003 was 11.2 global hectares, or 1.8 global hectares per person.
SNT.53142.13992	Demand overshot supply first in the 1980s and has been increasing every year since.
SNT.53142.13992-2	By 2003 the overshoot was about 25 per cent.
SNT.53142.13993	Thus, it took approximately a year and three months for the Earth to produce the ecological resources humanity used in that year.
SNT.53142.13994	The Living Planet Index and the Ecological Footprint, along with other measures, have been adopted as indicators for the 2010 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity.
SNT.53142.13995	The report concludes with a description of the roles of the various disciplines required to "shift humanity's current trajectory on to a path that will remain within the biological capacity of the planet".
SNT.53142.13996	James P. Leape, the Director General of WWF International summarises: 
SNT.53142.13996-2	"The message of these two indices is clear and urgent:"
SNT.53142.13996-3	"we have been exceeding the Earth's ability to support our lifestyles for the past 20 years, and we need to stop."
SNT.53142.13997	"We must balance our consumption with the natural world's capacity to regenerate and absorb our wastes."
SNT.147433.13998	Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who is US Senate Majority leader, is under a lot of criticism over comments he made during the 2008 United States presidential election, toward US President Barack Obama.
SNT.147433.13999	The highlighted comment made by Reid was calling Obama a "light-skinned" black man "with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one."
SNT.147433.14000	The remarks were released in a book co-written by Time magazine reporter Mark Halperin, and New York magazine reporter John Heileman.
SNT.147433.14001	Reid has since apologized for "using such a poor choice of words."
SNT.147433.14002	Reid has been a partner with the Obama Administration on issues such as health care reform.
SNT.147433.14003	Democratic Party chairman Tim Kaine told Meet the Press "the comments were unfortunate and they were insensitive", but "I think the case is closed because President Obama has spoken directly with the leader [Reid] and accepted his apology."
SNT.147433.14004	Members of the Republican Party have called on Reid to resign over his comments.
SNT.147433.14005	Party chairperson Michael Steele told Fox News Sunday "There is this standard where the Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it ... comes from the mouths of their own."
SNT.147433.14006	Having appeared alongside Kaine, where the Democrat Party chairman stated the case was closed, Steele argued that there was a double standard, on the basis of then-Senator Obama calling in 2002 calling for Trent Lott, at that time the majority leader, to be ousted for supporting the views of Strom Thurmond, who stood as a segregationist Presidential candidate in 1948.
SNT.147433.14007	The book Game Change published today, also says that New York Senator Chuck Schumer encouraged Barack Obama to run in early 2006, even though he later endorsed his former colleague Hillary Clinton.
SNT.147433.14008	Other revelations included that John McCain's aides were concerned about Sarah Palin's failure to understand basic facts prior to her ABC News interviews with Charles Gibson, including why North Korea and South Korea are separate countries.
SNT.147433.14009	Co-authors Halpern and Heileman have a history of vocal criticism of media coverage of the 2008 Presidential election.
SNT.147433.14010	In late 2008, Daily Kos reporter Jed Lewison drew attention to comments by Halpern, on-stage with Heilmen, asserting the reportage was, "extreme bias, extreme pro-Obama coverage"; he characterised election coverage as, "the most disgusting failure of people in our business since the Iraq war".
SNT.147433.14011	Halpern's centrepiece example was an analysis of New York Times profiles on the prospective First Ladies; overlooking earlier NYT coverage that reported on Obama's Caucasian ancestors being slave owners.
SNT.32173.14012	ABC News anchorman Bob Woodruff and his camera operator Doug Vogt have been seriously injured in an explosion.
SNT.32173.14013	Early reports indicate that both men sustained head injuries in the blast.
SNT.32173.14014	Woodruff was evacuated to the Balad Airbase, 68 kilometers north of Baghdad and is currently undergoing surgery.
SNT.32173.14015	"Bob and Doug are in serious condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital in Iraq," ABC said in a statement.
SNT.32173.14016	Reports say Woodruff was taping a report inside an Iraqi mechanized military vehicle near Taji, Iraq when the vehicle ran over and detonated an improvised explosive device.
SNT.32173.14017	ABC also reports that exchanges of small arms fire took place shortly after the explosion.
SNT.32173.14018	MSNBC reports that Woodruff and Vogt were wearing body armor and helmets when the explosion occurred, measures that may turn out to have saved their lives.
SNT.32173.14019	The Associated Press is reporting that the two men were standing in the hatch of the vehicle at the time of the explosion, and that no other people were injured.
SNT.32173.14020	Woodruff and Vogt had been embedded with the 4th Infantry Division that was accompanying an Iraqi Army unit.
SNT.32173.14021	ABC also said that both Woodruff and Vogt were wearing body armor and helmets.
SNT.32173.14022	The U.S. military headquarters in Baghdad has confirmed the attack took place.
SNT.32173.14023	Vogt, a 46-year-old Canadian based in France, is an Emmy-award winning cameraman for ABC News with 25 years of experience.
SNT.32173.14024	According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 61 journalists have been killed in the line of duty in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.
SNT.32173.14025	Woodruff became the permanent co-anchor of ABC's World News Tonight, with Elizabeth Vargas on January 3, 2006, replacing the late Peter Jennings.
SNT.54569.14026	The New York Mets baseball team has agreed to a 20-year sponsorship deal with financial house Citigroup for the team's new ballpark, now called CitiField.
SNT.54569.14027	The deal, which includes stadium naming rights, is worth more than $20 million annually, according to a baseball official.
SNT.54569.14028	This tops the approximately ten million annually the NFL's Houston Texans receive from Reliant Energy to call their home Reliant Stadium.
SNT.54569.14029	The agreement between the Mets and the financial services company includes options for both the team and Citigroup that could extend the deal to up to 35-years.
SNT.54569.14030	Other commercial arrangements are part of the contract, the official said.
SNT.54569.14031	Construction on the ballpark, next to the current stadium in Queens, New York, began last summer and is scheduled to be ready for the 2009 season.
SNT.54569.14032	The Mets have played at Shea Stadium since 1964, the team's third year in the league.
SNT.54569.14033	The ballpark is named for William A. Shea, a lawyer who helped bring National League baseball back to New York.
SNT.54569.14034	The announcement will be made Monday at a special ceremony that will be attended by New York Govener, George Pataki and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
SNT.54569.14035	Citigroup is one of the world's largest full-service banks, with two hundred million customers in more than 100 countries.
SNT.202266.14036	Tropical Storm Danielle is now a Category 1 hurricane, with winds up to 130 km/h (80 mph).
SNT.202266.14037	The storm is headed towards Bermuda and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida expect it to strengthen over the next two days.
SNT.202266.14038	Hurricane Danielle is the second hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
SNT.202266.14039	The 80 km/h (50 mph) storm in the Pacific Ocean is about 210 km (130 miles) south-south west of Acapulco, Mexico.
SNT.202266.14040	Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch in the area.
SNT.202266.14041	Hurricane Danielle formed near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six.
SNT.202266.14042	Meteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic hurricane season is currently at its peak.
SNT.202266.14043	"There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September."
SNT.202266.14044	"We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season," said Rick Knabb of the Weather Channel.
SNT.202266.14045	"Even though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas."
SNT.202266.14046	"It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage," Lauren McKeague, Florida Division of Emergency Management, says.
SNT.202266.14047	Hurricane Andrew was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season.
SNT.36381.14048	In the Six Nations Cup, Ireland beat England 28 points to 24, to win The Triple Crown.
SNT.36381.14049	Ireland have now beaten England on the last three occasions that these sides have met.
SNT.48582.14050	The software watchdog group StopBadware.org, run by the Berkman Center for Internet & Society of Harvard Law School and the Oxford Internet Institute, has opened a dialogue with AOL about concerns over the presence of badware, also known as malware, in the now-free AOL 9.0 software.
SNT.48582.14051	Badware refers to software applications that try to download additional software with very little or no explanation.
SNT.48582.14052	StopBadware.org decided to investigate after their users have sent in complaints regarding the operation of the software.
SNT.48582.14053	According to the "open inquiry" on StopBadware.org, the preliminary tests conclude that AOL 9.0 installs software and Internet Explorer extensions without the consent of the user, requires users to take certain actions, and it doesn't completely uninstall itself.
SNT.48582.14054	The page then warns readers not to use the AOL software unless they're prepared to handle the risks involved.
SNT.48582.14055	The report clarifies its charges; for example it lists "RealPlayer, QuickTime, AOL You've Got Pictures Screensaver, Pure Networks Port Magic, and Viewpoint Media Player" as the software that is installed without notification.
SNT.48582.14056	Additionally, the AOL toolbar, a bookmark to AOL.com, as well as extra icons are added to Internet Explorer without consent.
SNT.48582.14057	The report continues by noting that AOL coerces users into upgrading the software by a popup window that does not allow refusal, as well as automatically upgrades the software without allowing that option to be disabled.
SNT.48582.14058	AOL spokesman Andrew Weinstein claims that these problems are going to be addressed in an upgrade available next month.
SNT.48582.14059	In the meantime, Weinstein claims that the problems are not malicious.
SNT.48582.14060	"No one has done more to protect users from malware than AOL," Weinstein said.
SNT.48582.14061	John Palfrey agrees that the findings of AOL are not the worst he's seen, but they should disclose more information about the software to users.
SNT.48582.14062	When AOL was issued with an advance copy of the report, StopBadware.org was "very impressed" with their response, and that they look forward to working with AOL.
SNT.48644.14063	In the biggest ever narcotics haul in India's capital, the New Delhi police have seized over 4,400 kg of Mandrax and Rs. 20 crore from a dealer in the city.
SNT.48644.14064	The consignment, meant for a customer in the U.S, was seized from a godown in Badarpur, near the Delhi-Haryana border.
SNT.48644.14065	The alleged trafficker, identified as Vinod Sharma, claimed that the contraband was not his and that he had nothing to do with the matter.
SNT.48644.14066	Sharma started his career as a scrap-dealer in Delhi, and police suspect that with the help of some contacts he used container depots for drug-trafficking, whilst successfully dodging both the police and the Customs Department.
SNT.48644.14067	On Sunday the Delhi Police arrested him at his Kalkaji residence.
SNT.48644.14068	The Deputy Commissioner of Police for South District, Delhi Police, Anil Shukla said, "Sharma befriended container drivers and once they had driven past customs, he and his men would meet them at a distance and pilfer the containers."
SNT.10317.14069	An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) spokesman in Washington revealed Wednesday it had documented and reported to the United States credible information concerning desecration of the Koran by Guantanamo Bay personnel between January 2002 and January 2003.
SNT.10317.14070	The ICRC rarely discloses publicly the contents of the confidential reports it gives to governments.
SNT.10317.14071	Simon Schorno, Red Cross spokesman, said the ICRC's concerns were mentioned multiple times to Pentagon officials in their reports.
SNT.10317.14072	ICRC delegates have had access to Guantanamo Bay detainees since 2002 and have compiled and corroborated independent reports from detainees about desecration of the Koran numerous times to Guantanamo Bay commanders and Pentagon officials, said Mr. Schorno.
SNT.10317.14073	The ICRC representatives never observed any such incidents themselves, however.
SNT.10317.14074	Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman, acknowledged that allegations were made on "rare occasions" but were uncorroborated.
SNT.10317.14075	Mr. Schorno disputed the Pentagon's denial saying, "All information we received were corroborated allegations."
SNT.10317.14076	He added that, "We certainly corroborated mentions of the events by detainees themselves," and that "the ICRC considers such reports very seriously, and very carefully, and [we] document everything."
SNT.10317.14077	The reports ceased after January 19, 2003, when the Defense Department issued three pages of guidelines on proper treatment of Korans, according to Mr. Schorno.
SNT.10317.14078	On Wednesday Mr. Schorno gave credit for addressing the issue, saying, "We brought it up to the attention of the authorities, and it was followed through."
SNT.10317.14079	Some Muslim news agencies are still reacting to last week's Newsweek article alleging Korans had been thrown into Guantanamo Bay toilets.
SNT.10317.14080	The Jordanian newspaper Al-Dustur reported that some Middle Eastern TV stations were broadcasting images of Korans shredded by US forces in one Iraqi mosque.
SNT.10317.14081	New York-based Human Rights Watch special counsel Reed Brody said Wednesday that the White House's response to Newsweek's report of the desecrations should be fully investigated and that "those who ordered or condoned this abuse, [should] not attack those who have tried to report on it."
SNT.10317.14082	However, Scott McClellan explained in a press conference last Tuesday that the White House is not trying to tell Newsweek what to print.
SNT.10317.14083	McClellan said, "Look, this report caused serious damage to the image of the United States abroad."
SNT.10317.14084	"We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story."
SNT.10317.14085	"Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report."
SNT.10317.14086	"But, no, you're absolutely right, it's not my position to get into telling people what they can and cannot report."
SNT.31755.14087	The Council of Europe is pressing member governments to provide information concerning CIA prisons operating secretly in Europe.
SNT.31755.14088	In an interim report by the human rights council rapporteur, Swiss senator Dick Marty made public the 42-member nation's preliminary conclusions regarding CIA activity on European Union soil.
SNT.31755.14089	Marty reported, "Individuals have been abducted, deprived of their liberty and transported to different destinations in Europe, to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered degrading treatment and torture."
SNT.31755.14090	The report estimates the rendition of "more than a hundred persons."
SNT.31755.14091	But when it comes right down to it, no irrefutable evidence exists to confirm allegations that the CIA operated secret detention centers in Europe.
SNT.31755.14092	"There is a great deal of coherent, convergent evidence pointing to the existence of a system of 'relocation' or 'outsourcing of torture'," the report stated while further noting that, "It is highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware."
SNT.31755.14093	"Our aim is to find out the truth that is being hidden from us today", he said.
SNT.31755.14094	He adds that he is afraid of "the pressure put on the media in the United States not to report on this affair."
SNT.31755.14095	A researcher for Human Rights Watch, John Swift, said; "Cooperation is going to be needed if this investigation is going to succeed."
SNT.31755.14096	"They can decide to cooperate with this investigation and uphold European traditions of human rights, or they can continue their romance with the CIA."
SNT.31755.14097	The report has also been criticized for appearing to lack new content and to be incomplete.
SNT.31755.14098	Former minister for Europe and British member of parliament Denis MacShane has said that Marty's report "has more holes than a Swiss cheese."
SNT.31755.14099	US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack has rejected the report and stated that it was an example of the "same old reports wrapped up in some new rhetoric."
SNT.31755.14100	US Department of Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff has stated regarding the US government that "the government acts in accordance with the law and with respect to the sovereignty of host countries in which it operates," and further stated that "The authorities are free to investigate what they want to investigate but we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the need to identify, prevent and protect against terrorist acts of violence."
SNT.31755.14101	The group Amnesty International USA is calling for the US Congress to create a commission to investigate detention and interrogation practices.
SNT.31755.14102	The United States neither confirms nor denies the existence of secret detention centers.
SNT.122530.14103	Rico Daniels is a British TV presenter living in France who is known for his two television series — The Salvager — whilst he still lived in the UK and then Le Salvager after he moved to France.
SNT.122530.14104	Rico has been in a variety of jobs but his passion is now his profession - he turns unwanted 'junk' into unusual pieces of furniture.
SNT.122530.14105	Rico's creations and the methods used to fabricate them are the subject of the Salvager shows.
SNT.122530.14106	Rico spoke to Wikinews in January about his inspiration and early life, future plans, other hobbies and more.

SNT.109820.14108	The Co-operative Group (Co-op) and Bristol-based Somerfield today agreed on a deal worth £1.565 billion which results in Somerfield being acquired by Co-op.
SNT.109820.14109	Co-op has said that the acquisition took place on a "cash-free debt-free basis."
SNT.109820.14110	Peter Marks, chief executive of The Co-operative Group, claimed that "this is good news for consumers and for competition in the grocery market, where we will create a stronger fifth player in food and a convenience store chain with unrivalled geographic reach."
SNT.109820.14111	He then said that "for The Co-operative Group this is a transformational deal – cementing our position as the UK’s premier community retailer and helping us significantly as we lead a renaissance of The Co-operative brand."
SNT.109820.14112	Paul Mason, chair of privately-held Somerfield, also commented on the takeover.
SNT.109820.14113	"The Co-operative Group and Somerfield have a similar focus in terms of customers, store types, product ranges and business vision."
SNT.109820.14114	"Our shared vision of providing a high-quality and affordable convenience offer to local communities means that together we will be twice as strong, and therefore twice as able to deliver the local grocery shops British customers demand," he said.
SNT.109820.14115	With 4.4% share of the market, the Co-op is the fifth largest grocery chain in the UK.
SNT.109820.14116	The owners of Somerfield made their wish to sell the company clear in January of this year.
SNT.109820.14117	Co-op first expressed an interest in the purchase in April.
SNT.109820.14118	BBC News Online reported that the Competition Commission may force Co-op to sell some stores due to its increased presence.
SNT.64528.14119	The Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) notified the public, through a news release Wednesday, that a recent high volume of patients has put a strain on the hospital's resources.
SNT.64528.14120	The MHI requested that the public avoid its emergency department and find alternate care, if possible.
SNT.64528.14121	It did indicate that acute care emergency patients would not be turned away.
SNT.64528.14122	The notice was to be in place for 24 hours from Wednesday.
SNT.64528.14123	On Thursday, the MHI issued a extension to the public notice for an additional 24-hour period.
SNT.64528.14124	The number of patients that visited the MHI over the past few months had been abnormally high and reached a peak in the past two weeks, according to the head of emergency services.
SNT.64528.14125	Alain Vadeboncoeur indicated that it was unusual for the MHI to put out such an advisory, but assured the public that the hospital would "always take the big emergencies."
SNT.64528.14126	The hospital treats 45 to 50 emergency patients per day, typically, but that number jumped to as many as 70 patients per day in the past two weeks.
SNT.64528.14127	The MHI maintains 153 beds, including 42 in medical intensive care and 29 in surgical intensive care and performs 1,850 cardiac surgeries yearly.
SNT.64528.14128	It was suggested by the MHI that people requiring non-emergency care contact their regional Info-Santé for telephone-based advice, or visit a local clinic.
SNT.64528.14129	Founded in 1954, the MHI specializes in cardiovascular treatment, with an emphasis on prevention, specialized care, research, and assessment of new technologies.
SNT.64528.14130	The MHI is a teaching facility affiliated with the University of Montreal.
SNT.132043.14131	American-based online retailer Amazon.com has backtracked from its July decision and actions to remotely delete George Orwell's classic dystopian novels, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm, from customers' Kindle e-book readers.
SNT.132043.14132	Late Thursday, Amazon emailed owners of Kindle readers who had previously lost copies of these novels, offering a new copy of the deleted books, or a gift certificate or check for US$30.
SNT.132043.14133	In the email, the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos apologised again, and described the earlier actions as "stupid, thoughtless and painfully out of line with our principles."
SNT.132043.14134	Initially, the two works of Orwell were made available to Kindle owners by a third-party company which did not have the rights to distribute them.
SNT.132043.14135	When Amazon was alerted to this by the actual rights holder, the company removed the books from their online store then, far more controversially, remotely deleted the books from their customers' devices before issuing refunds.
SNT.132043.14136	In the aftermath of significant press coverage of Amazon's actions to remove content, legal action was started against them in Washington alleging violations of the company's published terms of service, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and Washington's consumer protection legislation.
SNT.132043.14137	A Michigan student named as a plaintiff in the case explained that the deletion of his copy of 1984 had rendered his annotations and notes worthless.
SNT.132043.14138	First published in 1949, the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four will not enter the public domain in the United States until 2044.
SNT.156506.14139	The president of Niger, Tandja Mamadou, has been captured and imprisoned by a group of Nigerien soldiers under the name of "Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy" after an attack on the presidential palace late Thursday.
SNT.156506.14140	The Nigerien embassy in London has issued a statement saying that both the president and ministers in his company were "safe and well," although officials said that the company was most likely imprisoned in military barracks outside of Niamy.
SNT.156506.14141	According to an announcement by the representative of the group responsible for the coup, a Nigerien Army colonel, the country's constitution has been suspended and all government institutions have been dissolved.
SNT.156506.14142	It is not clear who the leader of the coup is, although several military sources said that Major Adamou Harouna of the Nigerien Army was responsible.
SNT.156506.14143	The coup apparently took place during a cabinet meeting in the capitol building, and was preceded by a several-hour long gun battle in the capital, Niamy.
SNT.156506.14144	The battle began at about 13:00 local time (12:00 UTC), ending about four hours later, with both foot soldiers and tanks involved, although no significant deployment of the military was reported.
SNT.156506.14145	The morning after the battle, the streets were relatively quiet, and the only significant military presence is heavy artillery around the presidential palace.
SNT.156506.14146	The battle led to at least ten deaths, four of which were soldiers.
SNT.156506.14147	Additionally, a curfew has been imposed, and the military has closed Niger's borders.
SNT.156506.14148	Despite the crisis, the government has yet to release an official statement as to its status.
SNT.156506.14149	The actions of the military prompted condemnations of the coup from both the African Union and the nation of France, both of which called for negotiations to resolve the situation.
SNT.156506.14150	The West African group of countries Ecowas has already dispatched a delegation to talk to the group responsible for the coup.
SNT.156506.14151	The coup came after an extended political crisis in which President Tandja has dissolved both the National Assembly and Niger's High Court, as well as extending his presidential term by three years, and removing all further limits on his term.
SNT.156506.14152	These actions have led to increasing pressure against him and the government, culminating with a thousands-strong demonstration against the government last week.
SNT.2345.14153	Serial killer Michael Ross appeared before a Connecticut court today, and told Judge Patrick Clifford that he wanted to die.
SNT.2345.14154	If executed, Ross will be the first person put to death in Connecticut in over 40 years.
SNT.2345.14155	Ross admitted to killing eight women in Connecticut and New York in the 1980s, and to raping several of them.
SNT.2345.14156	The hearing considered whether Ross, who holds a degree in economics from Cornell University, was mentally competent to waive his appeals.
SNT.2345.14157	Dr. Michael Norko, appointed by the court to examine Ross, testified that Ross is a sexual sadist and is prone to depression.
SNT.2345.14158	Ross had attempted suicide three times in the past, Norko told the court, but he is not suicidal now.
SNT.2345.14159	Norko further testifed that Ross is taking medication to control his psychiatric problems.
SNT.2345.14160	Norko testified that Ross made a rational decision in electing to waive his appeals, and the court agreed, finding Ross clear headed and well educated.
SNT.2345.14161	"This decision is his right to make," Judge Clifford said from the bench.
SNT.2345.14162	However, Ross' father and the Connecticut Public Defender's Office have filed motions in Rockville Superior Court claiming that Ross suffered from mental delusions at the time of his orignial trial, and that his previous attorneys did a poor job defending him.
SNT.2345.14163	There is no word when the Rockville court will rule.
SNT.321955.14164	James Hipwell, a former financial reporter for the Daily Mirror tabloid, told the Leveson Inquiry today he believed hacking into voicemails of celebrities and others was a "bog-standard tool" for entertainment journalists at the Mirror.
SNT.321955.14165	Hipwell was fired from the paper in 2000 and then convicted and sent to prison in February 2006 for using his "City Slicker" column in the newspaper to write about companies he had a financial stake in, which netted him approximately £40,000.
SNT.321955.14166	Trinity Mirror newspapers, which publishes the Mirror, also publishes another tabloid The People which is also alleged to have used phone hacking to get stories.
SNT.321955.14167	Hipwell told the inquiry he believed that voicemail hacking was "genuinely accepted", "happened every day" and "was entirely accepted by the senior editors on the newspaper" and that "it was seen as a slightly underhand thing to do but not illegal."
SNT.321955.14168	Hipwell's testimony contradicts claims by the former editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, who now hosts a talk show on CNN.
SNT.321955.14169	Morgan claims that under his editorship, he was unaware of any hacking, but Hipwell claims it is unlikely Morgan did not know about hacking going on at the paper.
SNT.321955.14170	The Leveson Inquiry was set up by the British Prime Minister David Cameron following the scandal which engulfed the News of the World after widespread allegations they hacked into voicemails of crime victims and their families including the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, and has so far interviewed numerous representatives of the media industry, and alleged victims of press intrusion and phone hacking.
SNT.194714.14171	The United States and Russia yesterday agreed to the swap of prisoners held by both nations after eleven Russian spies were arrested late last month.
SNT.194714.14172	The swap will include the ten Russian spies arrested on US soil (the eleventh was arrested in Cyprus and subsequently escaped) and four spies being held in Russia on charges of espionage.
SNT.194714.14173	The spies arrested by the US all pled guilty to charges of "conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign country."
SNT.194714.14174	Below are the Russian spies who were convicted (cover names are in quotes, while real names are unquoted):*"Richard and Cynthia Murphy" *Vicky Paleaz *"Juan Lazaro" *Anna Chapman *Mikhail Zemenko *"Michael Zottoli" and "Patricia Mills" *"Donald Howard Heathfield" and "Tracy Lee Ann Foley"
SNT.194714.14176	The swap reportedly began late yesterday, with Russia beginning the process of releasing at least one of the prisoners they held, Igor Sutyagin, almost immediately.
SNT.194714.14177	Russian media reported that he had already arrived in Vienna, Austria, although his father said that it was so far unconfirmed.
SNT.194714.14178	Russia has so far not confirmed the identities of other prisoners to be released, although several names have been speculated, including Alexander Zaporozhsky, Sergei Skripal, and Alexander Sypachev, all accused of transferring information to foreign governments.
SNT.194714.14179	The US arrested the ten spies that are to be returned to Russia as part of its breakup of a long-term spy ring that had operated for years, and involved the spies living as American civilians, some as couples.
SNT.194714.14180	Prosecutors say that they had been commanded by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, with the mission of collecting information about American policy.
SNT.250055.14181	The tsunami caused by Japan's magnitude 8.9 quake on Friday destroyed the commercial fishing harbor of Crescent City, California, a coastal town still recovering from a devastating tsunami in 1964.
SNT.250055.14182	Although most of the fishing boats were removed in advance, the 198 docking slips that the harbor had provided for boats, enabling the livelihoods of the fishing crews, were lost.
SNT.250055.14183	"We're facing not only physical but financial disaster," he said during a briefing.
SNT.250055.14184	"Our business activity came to a screeching halt yesterday, and that affects the entire community."
SNT.250055.14185	Councilwoman Kelly Schellong said, "This is going to have a trickle-down effect beyond the lost jobs."
SNT.250055.14186	Crescent City's unemployment rate was 13 percent before Friday's tsunami destroyed its commerical fishing industry.
SNT.250055.14187	The 1964 tsunami that hit Crescent City killed 11, demolished the harbor and heavily damaged large portions of the business district.
SNT.250055.14188	Although the city subsequently rebuilt, another tsunami again damaged the harbor in 2006.
SNT.250055.14189	The city was in the midst of reconstructing the harbor when Friday's tsunami hit.
SNT.250055.14190	The harbor is surrounded by land and a breakwater built after the 1964 disaster.
SNT.250055.14191	The tsunami's huge waves entered through a small opening provided for the entrance and exit of boats.
SNT.250055.14192	Lori Dengler, director of the Humboldt Earthquake Education Center, says Friday's tsunami was one of as many as 38 tsunamis to strike Crescent City within the last 78 years.
SNT.250055.14193	She calls the city a "tsunami magnet" because of the topography of the ocean floor that contributes to its vulnerability.
SNT.250055.14194	She also blames the breakwater built after the 1964 tsunami because it traps tsunami waves in the harbor, causing them to boil and churn.
SNT.250055.14195	A county supervisor found the view painful on Saturday as she surveyed the wreckage accompanied by state officials.
SNT.34512.14196	The Centre for Independent Studies has released a paper calling for reform of university student fees system.
SNT.34512.14197	The paper, authored by Andrew Norton, argues that the cap on loans to full fee paying students is too low.
SNT.34512.14198	The current cap allows for loans during a lifetime of AU$50,950.
SNT.34512.14199	"Setting the FEE-HELP limit at this amount biases the market against courses that are long or have high per year costs, or both," argues Norton in the paper.
SNT.34512.14200	"The loan cap is a crude way of controlling lending, taking no account of course costs or capacity to repay."
SNT.34512.14201	He argues that the system should function more like commercial lending.
SNT.34512.14202	"A truly radical reform would make student loans mimic commercial loans: students with good earning prospects could borrow large sums, other students could borrow less, and some could not borrow at all," he said.
SNT.34512.14203	"Instead of denying or limiting loans to people doing high cost courses, as now occurs, the government could deny loans to people who are unlikely to repay."
SNT.34512.14204	The paper was criticised by Senator Kerry Nettle, Education Spokesperson for the Australian Greens.
SNT.34512.14205	She argued that the changes would mean an increase in costs to students already struggling to pay, and called on Education Minister Julie Bishop to rule out the changes.
SNT.34512.14206	"To consider refusing loans to those deemed less able to repay would further cut off higher education for Australians from low socio-economic backgrounds," she said.
SNT.34512.14207	"Julie Bishop should use her address to the National Press Club tomorrow to rule out any moves to further deregulate the HECS system."
SNT.34512.14208	"Student fees have spiralled upward under the Howard government and any further deregulation would just make a bad system worse," she added.
SNT.254611.14209	After an exhaustive two year, 20 million euro ($28 million) search, the final resting spot of Air France Flight 447 has been located.
SNT.254611.14210	The location of the wreckage is six miles north of the plane's last reported position off the coast of Brazil at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters (2,070 to 2,190 fathoms or 12,467 feet and 13,123 feet).
SNT.254611.14211	The wreckage of the Airbus A330-200, was found Sunday by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, using a Remus robotic submarine and its side-scan sonar.
SNT.254611.14212	After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage.
SNT.254611.14213	Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, France's Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea, confirmed to reporters: "Bodies were found."
SNT.254611.14214	"We are now confronted with another trauma," Robert Soulas, vice president of Entraide et Solidarité AF447, a support group for families of victims of the crash, said.
SNT.254611.14215	Soulas lost his daughter and son-in-law, who were on board the flight when it crashed.
SNT.254611.14216	"For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."
SNT.254611.14217	The remains of the plane, which were concentrated in a 600 metres by 200 metres (1,968 feet by 656 feet) area, appear to be relatively intact which leads investigators to believe that the plane hit the water intact and did not explode mid-air.
SNT.254611.14218	Around 50 bodies of the 228 passengers and crew on board and parts of the plane were found shortly after the crash in 2009.
SNT.254611.14219	According to Jean-Paul Troadec, the head of France's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the accident investigation body for aircraft overseeing the operation and investigation, the wreckage and bodies will be bought to surface and then sent to France for investigation.
SNT.254611.14220	The salvage operation, which will cost around 5 million euros ($7.1 million) according to estimates, will be financed by the French government.
SNT.254611.14221	Three salvage companies who are bidding to recover the wreck have until afternoon on Thursday to submit proposals.
SNT.254611.14222	The operation should take between three weeks to a month.
SNT.254611.14223	On raising the remains of the plane Troadec said: "We want to know what happened in this accident, most particularly so it never happens again."
SNT.254611.14224	Some family members agreed saying such as Michael Gaignard, whose sister was on board the plane said, "We want to know what happened in that plane."
SNT.254611.14225	An attorney for several families said some had yet to come to terms with loss of loved ones, saying "There's been no burial, no goodbye ... just lots and lots of suffering."
SNT.254611.14226	However, despite the discovery of the wreckage, the plane's two flight recorders, the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) have yet to be found at the crash site.
SNT.254611.14227	Alain Bouillard, who is in charge of BEA's recovery effort said, "It's still a jigsaw puzzle."
SNT.254611.14228	There are concerns that the two-year length the recorders have been submerged in seawater along with enormous pressure located at the depth of the wreck, that the data on the recorders might be unreadable.
SNT.254611.14229	Bouillard said it is possible the recorders were damaged, but had "great confidence" in their robustness.
SNT.254611.14230	Without the recovery of the recorders, investigators may be unable to determine the cause of the crash.
SNT.254611.14231	The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's pitot tubes, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is travelling.
SNT.254611.14232	Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash.
SNT.254611.14233	The plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down.
SNT.113686.14234	Archaeologists Timothy Darvill of Bournemouth University and Geoff Wainwright, President of the Society of Antiquaries, claimed to have found evidence that Stonehenge was once a center of healing.
SNT.113686.14235	In an excavation conducted at the site, a large number of human remains were found that display signs of physical injury or disease.
SNT.113686.14236	Study of the teeth from the skeletons indicates that about half of them were from outside the area.
SNT.113686.14237	A large number of bluestone or spotted Preseli dolerite chips found during the excavation led the researchers to conclude the stones were venerated for their healing properties.
SNT.113686.14238	It is believed that about 80 of such bluestone blocks were transported from the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire, Wales to the Salisbury plains.
SNT.113686.14239	The inner circle of bluestones are the earliest stone structures found in this site.
SNT.113686.14240	Later bluestones were encircled by the imposing sandstone monoliths of sarsen stones.
SNT.113686.14241	"It could be that people were flaking off pieces of bluestone, in order to create little bits to take away... as lucky amulets," said Professor Darvill.
SNT.113686.14242	Radiocarbon dating indicates that the original bluestone circle was built around 2300 BC.
SNT.113686.14243	This date coincides with the burial of "Amesbury Archer", whose tomb was discovered near Stonehenge.
SNT.113686.14244	The skeleton of this man reveals that he had serious knee injury and tooth problems.
SNT.113686.14245	Researchers therefore conclude that the Archer came to Stonehenge to be healed.
SNT.113686.14246	Dating of charcoal fragments revealed that the site was inhabited as early as 7200 BC by groups of hunter-gatherers.
SNT.113686.14247	This is more than 3500 years earlier than previously known.
SNT.526721.14248	London, England — The Australia national wheelchair rugby team defeated Canada 66–51 to win Australia's last gold medal of the 2012 Summer Paralympics.
SNT.526721.14249	The Canadian team had no answer to Ryley Batt, who scored 37 goals.
SNT.526721.14250	Before the game he skylarked by riding his wheelchair on one wheel.
SNT.526721.14251	The commentator called him "Houdini" for escaping any attempt to restrain him.
SNT.526721.14252	He did share the ball with the rest of the team.
SNT.526721.14253	By contrast, the Australian defenders held Canada's Garett Hickling to just seven goals.
SNT.526721.14254	At one point two Australian defenders trapped him in a corner, unable to move, which he appeared to find very frustrating.
SNT.526721.14255	Spectators included the Australian Chef de Mission, Jason Hellwig, and his deputies, Michael Hartung and Kate McLoughlin.
SNT.526721.14256	The rugby team's gold medal brought Australia's count to 32, and the total medals to 85, putting Australia in fifth place.
SNT.526721.14257	The team's gold medals were presented by HRH The Earl of Wessex.
SNT.109332.14258	Bertha became the first hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season Monday, after strengthening from a tropical storm overnight.
SNT.109332.14259	As of 11:00 am EDT, the Category 1 hurricane is located in the mid-Atlantic ocean, about 775 miles east of the Leeward Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.
SNT.109332.14260	It has maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, with higher gusts, and it is moving west-northwest at 15 miles per hour.
SNT.109332.14261	The storm is expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours, with a possibility of intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane later today.
SNT.109332.14262	The National Hurricane Center sees "no apparent environmental factors" to inhibit Bertha's intensification into a Category 2 storm.
SNT.109332.14263	Over the next few days, it is projected to gradually turn towards the northwest, while reducing in forward speed.
SNT.109332.14264	The National Hurricane Center has not said whether Bertha will affect any land areas.
SNT.109332.14265	However, a five-day forecast map shows Bertha passing near Bermuda around Saturday.
SNT.109332.14266	"While the degree of the turn has important implications regarding potential impacts to Bermuda," the National Hurricane Center said, "it is much too early to determine if Bertha will actually threaten that island."
SNT.109332.14267	Coincidentally, Bertha was also the name of a 1996 hurricane, which formed exactly 12 years ago on July 7.
SNT.10596.14268	Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) and mobile phone company O2 have said they intend to open London's Millennium Dome as a concert arena in April 2007.
SNT.10596.14269	The 365 m diameter dome was built in the 1990s for the year 2000 celebrations and is the largest single-roof structure in the world.
SNT.10596.14270	After hosting an exhibition for 2000, the dome has mostly laid empty.
SNT.10596.14271	The building, to be renamed the O2, will contain a 23,000 seat arena, an 1,800 seat theatre and a 2,200 capacity night club.
SNT.140894.14272	Afghan government officials have said that a powerful suicide car bomb hit near the Indian Embassy in Kabul on Thursday, killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 80 others.
SNT.140894.14273	The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, saying their target was the embassy.
SNT.140894.14274	The Afghan Interior Ministry says the explosion killed mostly civilians on the heavily guarded road between its headquarters and the Indian Embassy.
SNT.140894.14275	Eyewitnesses reports said that the the blast was very powerful, shattering shop windows, filling the air with dust and scattering debris all along the road.
SNT.140894.14276	General Sayed Abdul Ghafar Sahibzada, the Kabul police chief, said the suicide bomber exploded his vehicle in the center of the capital.
SNT.140894.14277	Thursday's blast comes one day after the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion into Afghanistan to topple the Taliban government.
SNT.140894.14278	Last year, a similar attack by a Taliban suicide car bomber killed about 60 people near the Indian embassy.
SNT.140894.14279	It was the deadliest assault in the capital since 2001.
SNT.60968.14280	Recently elected Markham, Ontario MPP Michael Chan became Ontario's Revenue Minister today to reflect the large Chinese-Canadian community.
SNT.60968.14281	Former Ontario NDP premier Bob Rae created the revenue ministry.
SNT.60968.14282	Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty recreated it because he wanted Chan in it.
SNT.60968.14283	He also said that Finance Minister Greg Sorbara needs a hand with his job and this would help.
SNT.60968.14284	"Michael is a strong member of our team and brings a great deal of experience to this position," McGuinty said today.
SNT.60968.14285	"Michael is passionate about building opportunity for Ontario families and we're happy to have him on the team."
SNT.60968.14286	Before getting in power, Chan owned an insurance brokerage in Markham with hundreds of agents.
SNT.60968.14287	Chan won on February 8 and was just sworn in two days ago.
SNT.247020.14288	At 4:53 p.m. (EDT), Space Shuttle Discovery took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on its final mission, STS-133.
SNT.247020.14289	Its mission is to deliver and install onto the International Space Station (ISS), the Permanent Multipurpose Module Leonardo, the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-4 and provide critical spare components for the station.
SNT.247020.14290	Six astronauts, Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Alvin Drew, Nicole Stott, Michael Barratt, and Steve Bowen, are participating in the mission.
SNT.247020.14291	The shuttle is also carrying Robonaut2, the first dexterous humanoid robot to be in space.
SNT.247020.14292	Although its first priority will be to test its operation in microgravity, upgrades could eventually allow it to fulfill its ultimate purpose of becoming an astronaut helper on boring or dangerous tasks.
SNT.247020.14293	The launch of Discovery, which was supposed to occur at 4:50 p.m., was delayed for three minutes due to a technical problem in the shuttle's command system and a chipped heat shield tile near the crew hatch which needed to be patched.
SNT.247020.14294	The launch was also repeatedly postponed since November 1 due to various technical problems with the shuttle's systems and a hydrogen leak in the fuel tank along with cracks and bad weather.
SNT.247020.14295	A small piece of foam broke off during the launch but NASA has reported that it is unlikely to cause problems.
SNT.247020.14296	Discovery and the crew of STS-133 are scheduled to spend about two weeks in space and aboard the ISS, logging 4.5 million additional miles of flight.
SNT.247020.14297	The launch comes just hours after an unmanned automated European cargo spacecraft, ATV-2, docked with the orbiting outpost to deliver supplies and equipment to the crew.
SNT.247020.14298	STS-133 is scheduled to be the final mission of Discovery, with its first being STS-41-D in 1984.
SNT.247020.14299	Discovery flew 39 flights in its operational history, including the current mission, delivering several payloads to space including the Hubble Space Telescope and visiting two different space stations: Mir and the ISS.
SNT.247020.14300	STS-133 is the 133rd shuttle mission and the 35th mission to the ISS.
SNT.247020.14301	Discovery is the oldest surviving shuttle, and has flown more missions than any other shuttle.
SNT.247020.14302	It was also the first shuttle to fly after the Challenger disaster and was the first shuttle to fly after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
SNT.247020.14303	Later, Discovery became the first shuttle to fly a Russian cosmonaut.
SNT.247020.14304	After the current mission, there will be at most two remaining shuttle flights.
SNT.247020.14305	Endeavor has one more mission remaining, and if an emergency rescue is needed or more funding is secured, Atlantis will also fly once more before the entire fleet is retired.
SNT.247020.14306	"The shuttle has provided an amazing capacity for this country to gather data."
SNT.247020.14307	"I think we’re still sorting through a lot of it, trying to figure out what all we’ve learned from it."
SNT.247020.14308	"This chapter in our space history known as the space shuttle has been incredible," said Bryan Lunney, lead space shuttle flight director for the mission.
SNT.41940.14309	Kabul Afghanistan saw the worst violence on Monday since the fall of the Taliban, after a large U.S. Military cargo truck crashed into about a dozen vehicles at an intersection in Kabul killing at least 7 civilians and injuring about 40.
SNT.41940.14310	"There was a traffic jam and all the vehicles were stopped," said one witness, 21-year old shopkeeper Mohammad Wali.
SNT.41940.14311	"The American convoy hit all the vehicles which were on the way."
SNT.41940.14312	A U.S. military spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Fitzpatrick, said no U.S. troops had been hurt, and that an investigation has begun into the incident.
SNT.41940.14313	The U.S. military also said the crash was caused by brake failure but Afghans often complain about aggressive driving tactics of the U.S. military.
SNT.41940.14314	Convoys often pass through crowded areas at high speed and occasionally disregard road rules.
SNT.41940.14315	U.S. military says such driving is necessary to protect the troops from attack.
SNT.41940.14316	Afghan rioters also claimed U.S. troops had shot and killed civilians at the scene of the accident.
SNT.41940.14317	Chanting "Death to America," rioters stoned the U.S. convoy involved in the accident Monday before heading to the center of Kabul where they ransacked offices of international aid groups and searched for foreigners.
SNT.41940.14318	Smoke billowed from burning buildings along the path of destruction.
SNT.140881.14319	Royal Mail workers have voted 3:1 in favour of a nationwide postal strike in the United Kingdom.
SNT.140881.14320	The Communication Workers' Union (CWU), that represents employees of the postal service balloted members on nationwide strike action, following a series of regional strikes over the past 3 weeks.
SNT.140881.14321	Of the 80,830 members consulted, 61,623 voted in favour of a walk-out.
SNT.140881.14322	The union's General Secretary, Dave Ward, said that there would be no strike action for at least 10 days.
SNT.140881.14323	The possibility of further talks with the Royal Mail before undertaking action has not be ruled out; any walk-outs in the run-up to Christmas will cause extreme disruption to deliveries.
SNT.112040.14324	New South Wales Police have broadened investigations into Australia's oldest Catholic boarding school, St Stanislaus College in Bathurst, New South Wales, following claims that at least 13 men were sexually abused while children at the school in the 1970s and 1980s.
SNT.112040.14325	The claims have surfaced following police being alerted in August last year.
SNT.112040.14326	Police have appealed for victims to come forward, but acknowledged it may be difficult for some.
SNT.112040.14327	"I would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward," Detective Superintendent Michael Goodwin said.
SNT.112040.14328	"All I can say is that NSW police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble-free as possible."
SNT.112040.14329	Superintendent Goodwin reassured the community that the allegations date back two decades and there is "absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that the college involved is/has been looking to anything in the current day."
SNT.112040.14330	"The college involved has been cooperating with the police completely with this inquiry," Goodwin added.
SNT.112040.14331	The police would not release how many suspects were being investigated but said their inquiries had not led them to any other locations where former staff may have been employed.
SNT.112040.14332	Superintendent Goodwin said Police were exploring all lines of enquiry and that "no loose ends [are] being let go at this stage."
SNT.112040.14333	The school's principal, John Edwards, said the police had served him with a search warrant last month which listed the names of three former staff members.
SNT.112040.14334	"There were three former staff member who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early July, and we facilitated the gathering of material for police," Mr Edwards told Fairfax Radio Network.
SNT.112040.14335	Mr Edwards called for the matter to be transparent and described the complaints as "gravely concerning" and he hopes they are properly dealt with by the courts.
SNT.112040.14336	"It is absolutely a requirement for this matter to be open, for this matter to be addressed and this matter to be resolved," he said.
SNT.112040.14337	"This school is very concerned to ensure that children are treated well and that their interests are protected."
SNT.112040.14338	A former priest, Brian Joseph Spillane, aged 65 was arrested over the case in May.
SNT.112040.14339	He faced Bathurst Local Court in July, facing 33 separate charges including six counts of sexual intercourse with pupils aged 10 and 18.
SNT.112040.14340	Spillane's lawyer, Greg Walsh, says media reports alerted him to the new claims.
SNT.112040.14341	"I don't know anything about eight alleged other victims, I've not been served with any witness statements so I really can't comment about it," said Walsh.
SNT.112040.14342	One former student described the alleged abuse as "an orgy", claiming that boys were herded into a prayer room by a priest chanting "hypnotic" spells in tongues.
SNT.112040.14343	It is alleged that boys were subject to sexual abuse or forced to assault each other once in the prayer room.
SNT.112040.14344	A former border told The Daily Telegraph that priests "got a group between eight and 12 of us together and they'd just start chanting and I would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on."
SNT.112040.14345	The allegations came to light after one of the alleged victims made a visit to Bathurst last year to hand out fliers documenting the abuse and providing a link to his website address.
SNT.112040.14346	The school called in police, who the victim claims contacted him and asked him to make a complaint.
SNT.42817.14347	Two teenagers have been found shot to death in Salford, Greater Manchester, w:UK.
SNT.42817.14348	One of the victims is a 15-year old girl, the other victim is a male aged 18.
SNT.42817.14349	Emergency services were called to reports of a shooting on Saturday morning.
SNT.42817.14350	The man died in an ambulance en-route to the hospital.
SNT.42817.14351	A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said officers were still trying to establish the circumstances of the shooting.
SNT.42817.14352	"Police were called to Orion Place in Lower Broughton, Salford, following reports that shots had been fired."
SNT.42817.14353	"Officers attended and discovered the body of a 15-year-old girl."
SNT.42817.14354	"An 18 year-old boy was also found at the scene."
SNT.42817.14355	"He was taken to a hospital by ambulance but died a short time later."
SNT.42817.14356	"The investigation is at a very early stage and inquiries are continuing," the spokeswoman said.
SNT.42817.14357	The Heath Avenue area is sealed off while officers investigate.
SNT.40788.14358	News articles frequently discuss some issues but neglect others that might be more critical.
SNT.40788.14359	Today the UN issued its third annual list to focus attention on a set of these relatively ignored stories.
SNT.126661.14360	Police reports state that a bomb blast in a church in Nepal on Saturday has killed two people and injured at least a dozen more.
SNT.126661.14361	The attack comes just hours before the national parliament was due to elect a new prime minister.
SNT.126661.14362	The bomb detonated in the Church of the Assumption in the town of Lalitpur, located south of Nepal's capital of Kathmandu.
SNT.126661.14363	Around 150 people were in the church at the time of the explosion.
SNT.126661.14364	According to the Nepalese home ministry spokesman, Navin Ghimire, the National Defence Army, an obscure Hindu extremist group, left a message at the scene of the disaster, assuming responsibility for the explosion.
SNT.126661.14365	The group says it wants to return Nepal's Hindu monarchy back to power after it was abolished last year.
SNT.126661.14366	It has taken responsibility for the killing of a missionary in July of last year.
SNT.126661.14367	This is the first bomb attack on a Christian church in Nepal.
SNT.57917.14368	Egypt intends to launch an international initiative to fight misuse of the internet.
SNT.57917.14369	The idea lies in implementing a long-term international cooperation plan that concerns suppressing the activity of criminals and other groups that use World Wide Web for promoting their interests.
SNT.57917.14370	He also outlined the fact that the plan for fighting cyber-crime stipulates the introduction of new rules for Internet users.
SNT.82497.14371	The game does not affect Group D as both Germany and the Czech Republic have already qualified for next summer's tournament.
SNT.82497.14372	The victory for Germany keeps them tied in first position in Group D. 
SNT.82497.14372-1	Germany finishes off its Euro 2008 qualification games against Wales on Wednesday.
SNT.454206.14373	A new study by Duke University in the US suggests depressed adolescents who respond to treatment within twelve weeks are at a reduced risk of drug abuse later in their lives.
SNT.454206.14374	The research followed about half of a pool of 439 adolescents who had received treatment for major depression and volunteered for Duke University research.
SNT.454206.14375	At the five-year study's conclusion the participants were aged 17–23.
SNT.454206.14376	Of those who had experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms within twelve weeks of treatment, ten percent went on to have drug abuse problems.
SNT.454206.14377	Alcohol use problems, however, were equally prevalent regardless of treatment outcome.
SNT.454206.14378	The study was run by Dr. John Curry, a professor of neuroscience and psychology.
SNT.454206.14379	Curry noted that the results for those treated successfully held true "whatever they responded to — cognitive-behavioral therapy, Prozac, both treatments, or a placebo".
SNT.454206.14380	The study has called for treatments to take possible alcohol and drug use into account.
SNT.454206.14381	Said Curry, "When the teenagers got over the depression, about half of them stayed well for the whole five-year period, but almost half of them had a second episode of depression... what we found out was that, for those who had both alcohol disorder and another depression, the alcohol disorder almost always came first".
SNT.454206.14382	He also said the study had "a take-home message" in "that alcohol use disorders are very prevalent during that particular age period and there’s a need for a lot of prevention and education for college students to avoid getting into heavy drinking and then the beginnings of an alcohol disorder".
SNT.454206.14383	Curry, alongside Dr. Susan Silva, a co-author, want more research using larger groups.
SNT.454206.14384	They also say work towards a comparison with non-depressed individuals is needed.
SNT.62209.14385	The government of Eritrea warned of "dire consequences" unless Uganda removes its troops from the African Union (AU) peacekeeping force deployed to Somalia.
SNT.62209.14386	Ali Abdu, Eritrea’s information minister stated, "We believe the government of Uganda must rectify its error and pull out from Somalia, otherwise the situation will become increasingly dangerous."
SNT.62209.14387	"It will not only worsen, but will become a war between the Somali people and external forces."
SNT.62209.14388	Uganda has already sent 1,000 of a planned 1,500 troops under AU auspices to the area.
SNT.62209.14389	The AU plans to send 8,000 multinational troops in total, and has recently vowed to continue their deployment despite attacks on its first deployed forces and threats of an Islamist commander.
SNT.62209.14390	The Islamic Courts Movement has also threatened to wage jihad against the peacekeeping forces.
SNT.62209.14391	Reacting to the comments, Paddy Ankunda, a spokesman for the Uganda Peoples Defense Force (UPDF) said, "Eritrea has no right to demand that we withdraw."
SNT.62209.14392	"Unless they are claiming they are not part of the African Union."

SNT.119744.14451	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh received a successful coronary artery bypass surgery and was recuperating well in the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Sunday.
SNT.119744.14452	Dr. Manmohan Singh is the 17th and current Prime Minister of the Republic of India.
SNT.119744.14453	He also serves as the Union Minister for Finance, succeeding P. Chidambaram.
SNT.119744.14454	According to critical care specialist Dr. Vijay D'Silva, who has been entrusted with his post-operative care, Singh has been given a liquid diet since morning including a cup of tea, and was speaking to doctors after the procedure.
SNT.119744.14455	"The way you [doctors] are taking care of me, you should also take care of other people", Dr. D'Silva, who received his basic medical training in Nagpur and headed the ICU at Mumbai's Jaslok and Lilavati Hospitals before he helped set up the ICU at the ultra-modern Asian Heart Institute, quoted Singh as saying.
SNT.119744.14456	"The second operation always takes longer and makes it difficult to reach the heart."
SNT.119744.14457	"We did a total of five by-passes to clear multiple blockages in his arteries."
SNT.119744.14458	"Surgery was the long term answer since there were many blockages."
SNT.119744.14459	"We will take the PM out of the breathing machine in the next 2-3 hours and the PM should stay for three days in the ICU and then 4-5 days more in the hospital," Drs. Panda and D'Silva explained.
SNT.119744.14460	Singh's personal physician and AIIMS cardiac surgeon, Dr. K. S. Reddy, has predicted the PM will be allowed to attend to some official work in two weeks, to most of the duties in four weeks and will be able to resume office in six weeks.

SNT.119744.14462	"PM was sent back to the ICU at 8:55 pm," said Dr. Reddy.
SNT.119744.14463	"The team has brought about 20 boxes of special equipment with it."
SNT.119744.14464	"Earlier, Dr. K. S. Reddy had discussions with Dr. Panda in connection with the line of treatment to be followed," the team of 11 doctors said.
SNT.119744.14465	The team of surgeons made a 6 to 7 inch incision along the scar that marked the PM's 1990 bypass operation, and he was given five grafts.
SNT.119744.14466	"The new grafts, all 3 mm long, will last the PM the rest of his life," said Dr. Pradyot Kumar Rath from the Asian Heart Institute.
SNT.119744.14467	"If the PM could have been so active with all the blockages, he can be even more active now," Dr Panda said.
SNT.119744.14468	Singh underwent a coronary angiography at the AIIMS hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday and was discharged on Thursday.

SNT.119744.14478	Singh, a diabetic, underwent a bypass surgery in Britain in 1990 and had an angioplasty in 2004 in Delhi in which stents were introduced in his arteries.
SNT.119744.14479	He had earlier been operated for a benign enlarged prostate in 2007, and for nerve compression in both wrists in 2006 and cataract removal procedure last year, officials said.
SNT.119744.14480	The Congress Party, which leads the coalition Government, has said that he will remain Prime Minister if Congress and its allies win again.
SNT.119744.14481	But Congress is reportedly planning to replace him, possibly within two years, with Rahul Gandhi, the 38-year-old son of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born Congress leader.

SNT.54751.14491	The bodyguard lost both legs due to shrapnel wounds and is still in surgery, several hours after the attack.
SNT.54751.14492	The Al-Quds Brigades, military wing of Islamic Jihad, took responsibility for the attack, saying they have launched "two sophisticated Quds rockets at a mid-range" as a retaliation for the IDF artillery shelling of Beit Hanoun earlier this month, in which 19 people were killed.
SNT.54751.14493	Izz al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military wing, also took responsibility for the attack.
SNT.54751.14494	IDF officials said today that the attack was carried out from the area around Beit Hanoun cemetery, where large-scale Qassam launching operation is underway.
SNT.54751.14495	Another attack occurred hours later, when another rocket landed near several young men, injuring a 17-year-old youth severely and several others lightly.

SNT.285315.14498	The UN has certified that the Delhi Metro has aided in the reduction of greenhouse gases, earning 'carbon credits'.
SNT.285315.14499	This makes the Delhi Metro the first of its kind in the world to do so.
SNT.285315.14500	This comes under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the UN under the Kyoto Protocol.
SNT.285315.14501	The UN said the rail based system has helped to save 630,000 tonnes of pollution a year.
SNT.285315.14502	The credits to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) are worth $9.5 million for each of the next seven years.
SNT.285315.14503	More credits would be given for more passengers on the system.
SNT.285315.14504	The credits are designed as a financial incentive for developing countries to reduce greenhouse emissions.
SNT.285315.14505	According to the DMRC, it has reduced road traffic by more than 91,000 vehicles per day.
SNT.53578.14506	Studies conducted by a team of physicists at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) conclude that new synthetic NBA basketballs are less lively, more slippery when damp, and bounce more erratically than the traditional leather balls.
SNT.53578.14507	James Horwitz, Chairman of the UTA Department of Physics was contacted by the Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to study the new ball.
SNT.53578.14508	Horwitz asked UTA physics professor Kaushik De to lead the project.
SNT.53578.14509	De's team found that the new balls are tackier when dry, but become much more slippery than leather balls when they get damp.
SNT.53578.14510	Traditional leather basketballs provide more grip when they are slightly wet.
SNT.53578.14511	The synthetic balls bounce 30% more sporadically, possibly due to deep embossing, and are less lively than leather basketballs.
SNT.53578.14512	Some of these issues could be fixed with a variety of methods, including modification of the embossing, increasing the air pressure in the balls beyond the regulation 8.5 psi, and constantly drying the balls with towels during the game or frequently replacing them with fresh basketballs, say De and Horwitz.
SNT.143040.14513	Erosion in Nigeria has lead to increasing concern on climate policy for the entire country.
SNT.143040.14514	Areas in Nigeria have been subject to damages caused by increasing erosion for over 50 years.
SNT.143040.14515	This issue has grown over the past years, and responsibility has been pointed at a lack of national policy.
SNT.143040.14516	However, locals recognize that they too contribute to the problem.
SNT.143040.14517	"Some of the problem of erosion is created by our people, by our attitude to waste disposal."
SNT.143040.14518	"When we dump garbage in the drains that are built by the government we simply aggravate the problem of erosion," said state environmental commissioner Michael Egbebike.
SNT.143040.14519	"And this waste combined with the force of the flood and trying to erode the soil and sometimes they actually block the channel that has been created for flood dispersion and the floods come back and actually destroy their homes, and at that point they call on government," he added.
SNT.143040.14520	Geological studies of the area affected most by erosion, Anambra, have concluded that the cost of implementing a project which could effectively slow erosion are estimated at US$2 billion.
SNT.143040.14521	Officials are looking for answers and help in funding a project at the Copenhagen environmental conference in December.
SNT.143040.14522	"The state is struggling because the monies spent on this erosion problem are huge sums of money."
SNT.143040.14523	"So we will of course need a lot of help from the international community and the federal government."
SNT.143040.14524	"Alone it would be a Herculean task for Anambra state," commented Egbebike.
SNT.208980.14525	A Polish soldier was killed yesterday by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan.

SNT.88095.14550	The person killed is also being reported as male aged 23 who is reportedly a friend of the brothers.
SNT.88095.14551	Both the injured individuals are currently receiving treatment at San Francisco General Hospital.
SNT.88095.14552	All animals were then counted and accounted for after the zoo was locked down, including the three other tigers that were in the cage.
SNT.88095.14553	Earlier reports suggested that all of the tigers had escaped, which later turned out to be false.
SNT.88095.14554	The incident is currently under investigation, but authorities are not ruling out any possibilities, including possible negligence.
SNT.88095.14555	"We won't know until tomorrow whether this was negligence or intentional or how the tiger got out," said Sgt.
SNT.88095.14556	The zoo has two different kinds of tigers, two Siberian and one Sumatran tigers.
SNT.88095.14557	The Siberian tigers are named Tony and Tatiana while the Sumatran is named Padang.

SNT.8075.14574	The United States Marshals Service working together with nearly 960 other law enforcement agencies recently concluded a week-long operation, Operation FALCON, which succeeded in the arrest of 10,340 fugitives across the United States and elsewhere.
SNT.8075.14575	Other regional sweeps have been conducted before; but this was the first of its kind at the national level and resulted in the highest number of arrests ever recorded in a single operation.
SNT.8075.14576	Operation FALCON, which stands for "Federal And Local Cops Organized Nationally", received the cooperation of more than 3,000 law enforcement agents from the US Marshals, state, county and city level, and other US agencies.
SNT.8075.14577	Operations were also coordinated internationally with INTERPOL and the US State Department, resulting in the detainment of 16 foreign and international fugitives.
SNT.8075.14578	Operation FALCON was conducted during a one week period, April 4-10, 2005, chosen to coincide with National Crime Victim's Rights Week, April 10-16, the dates being chosen to "honor the victims" of violent crime in America.
SNT.8075.14579	“By taking violent fugitives off the streets and putting them behind bars where they belong,” said Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, “we've honored the victims and made our streets safer.”
SNT.8075.14580	The focus of Operation FALCON was on apprehending fugitives wanted for violent crimes, gang activities, drug trafficking, and sex-related offenses.
SNT.8075.14581	Arrests were made in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and in several International locales.
SNT.8075.14582	“I applaud the achievements of every Deputy Marshal, police officer, detective, trooper, investigator, deputy sheriff, and special agent who hit the street virtually around-the-clock for seven days,” said Robert J. Finan II, the Marshals Service’s Assistant Director for Investigative Services.
SNT.8075.14583	He continued, “Also of note is that during the course of this initiative, there were no serious incidents or serious injuries to either law enforcement officers or those who were taken into custody.”
SNT.110781.14584	Benjamin Mullany, the British man who was shot along with his wife while on holiday in Antigua has died.
SNT.110781.14585	He and his wife, Catherine had been on the last day of their honeymoon when both were shot during what seems to be a botched robbery on July 29.
SNT.110781.14586	Doctors were unaware if he knew that his wife did not survive the attack.
SNT.110781.14587	Ben was flown back to Britain on August 2 after a 22 hour operation to try and save his life.
SNT.110781.14588	He died at Morriston Hospital, in Swansea, Wales where he remained unresponsive.
SNT.110781.14589	The couple married on July 12 and later flew out to the holiday island.
SNT.110781.14590	With the death of both Catherine and Ben the murder figures for Antigua have been placed into double figures.
SNT.110781.14591	Prime minister Baldwin Spencer has asked for Britain's help during the investigation.
SNT.320674.14592	The Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il, has died according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
SNT.320674.14593	The cause of death was "advanced acute myocardial infarction, complicated by serious heart shock," commonly known as a heart attack.
SNT.320674.14594	Kim apparently died two days earlier on December 17 aboard a train.
SNT.320674.14595	However, other records from the former Soviet Union place his age at 70.
SNT.320674.14596	At the same time, Kim's son, Kim Jong-un has been named as the "Great Successor" by North Korean state media.
SNT.320674.14597	Citizens are being told they "must faithfully revere respectable comrade Kim Jong-un."
SNT.320674.14598	"At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome today's difficulties," according to KCNA.
SNT.320674.14599	According to Yonhap News Agency, South Korea's military is on "emergency alert" following a meeting by South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
SNT.320674.14600	According to a JCS official, "We're keeping close tabs on the demilitarized zone (DMZ), Joint Security Area (JSA) and Northern Limit Line (NLL) for possibilities of North Korean provocations."
SNT.320674.14601	South Korean President Lee Myung-bak also presided over a meeting.
SNT.320674.14602	A statement from Lee's office said, "The government will remain thoroughly prepared while keeping a close watch over the situation in North Korea."
SNT.320674.14603	"The government will also cooperate closely with the international community to maintain peace and safety on the Korean Peninsula."
SNT.53335.14604	A "critical" campaign ad, launched by the US Republican Party, that took a swipe at Canada has been pulled.
SNT.53335.14605	"Canada can take care of North Korea," a man in the television ad says.
SNT.53335.14606	The ad's purpose was to blast Democratic Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr, who is running against Republican Bob Corker.
SNT.53335.14607	The comment about Canada is secondary to the ad's first purpose.
SNT.53335.14608	An official for the Republican National Committee told NBC the ad had been pulled because it had "run its course," just one day after party chairman Ken Mehlman defended the ad and said it would continue to run.
SNT.53335.14609	"Just imagine if I registered a complaint every time my country or president was criticized," said the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, David Wilkins.
SNT.53335.14610	"Compare that (one ad) with the criticism early this year during the (federal) election that happened every day in Canada ...ads that were run consistently throughout your country."
SNT.53335.14611	A source within the Canadian government told the Canadian Press that Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Michael Wilson called the White House to remind the Republicans of the heavy load Canada is carrying in Afghanistan.
SNT.53335.14612	The Canadian Embassy in Washington has been on an advertising campaign, plastering subway stations in Washington with posters depicting Canadian troops in Afghanistan.
SNT.53335.14613	There is also a website featuring military cooperation between Canada and the U.S.
SNT.53335.14614	The Canadian ambassador to the U.S. has issued a complaint to Washington in response to the television ad.
SNT.53335.14615	The 30 second ad (see source below) can now be viewed on YouTube.
SNT.15773.14616	A wet late Spring season's increase in rainfall helped duck populations rebound in the northern Great Plains near the U.S.-Canadian border.
SNT.15773.14617	A dry Winter and resulting low ground water levels threatened duck nesting grounds in the area.
SNT.15773.14618	Much to the relief of duck hunters, who feared a possible 2005 ban on duck hunting, the most-recent waterfowl survey released this week by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed duck populations in South Dakota on the rebound.
SNT.15773.14619	This contrasted to a May survey that showed fewer ducks and waterfowl nesting areas in the state with the population of breeding ducks numbering 1.6 million, down from 1.7 million in 2004.
SNT.15773.14620	The same May survey indicated that duck habitats, specifically ponds, had declined more than 35 percent from the historical average.
SNT.15773.14621	However, late Spring rains reportedly improved wetland conditions and irrigated grasslands for grazing duck broods and re-nesting hens.
SNT.15773.14622	The figures are used to set duck-hunting limits for the fall season, which begins in August.
SNT.15773.14623	"I have observed many duck broods across eastern South Dakota in July, and grassland cover looks great statewide," Spencer Vaa, a waterfowl biologist with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks said in an Associated Press report.
SNT.80018.14624	Germany's minister of defence, Franz-Josef Jung (CDU), has proposed to shoot down planes hijacked by terrorists.
SNT.80018.14625	Although the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany decided in February 2006 that shooting down a hijacked plane would only be lawful if there were no innocent passengers on the plane, Jung announced in public that he would give the order to attack if the basic principles of the constitution were in danger or if the plane posed a tremendous threat to the people.
SNT.80018.14626	Representatives of the grand coalition differed in their views regarding this question.
SNT.80018.14627	A member of the Social Democrat Party disagreed with Jung and advised him against contradicting the court's judgment.
SNT.80018.14628	The opposition in parliament even called Jung an "enemy of the constitution" and called for him to resign.
SNT.80018.14629	Jung was supported by members of his own party which underlined the necessity of shooting down a hijacked plane in order to save thousands of lives.
SNT.80018.14630	The dispute between the two coalition partners concerning new laws to ensure the security of Germany remains unresolved.
SNT.80018.14631	The pilots of the German airforce have made it clear that they won't bring down a hijacked plane due to fundamental legal and moral doubts.
SNT.80018.14632	In the United States and other European countries such as France, Great Britain or the Czech Republic laws were passed which give the government permission to shoot down a passenger plane under the control of terrorists.
SNT.101994.14633	Britain has stated that it will reconsider the asylum application of a gay Iranian teenager who believes he will be persecuted for his sexuality if he is deported back to Iran.
SNT.101994.14634	The announcement Friday by the British government came after the European Parliament urged a resolution to the case and said that Iran has a history of torturing and executing homosexuals.
SNT.101994.14635	Britain had initially rejected an asylum request by 19-year-old Mehdi Kazemi, and Kazemi fled to the Netherlands, where his case was turned down and he returned to Britain.
SNT.101994.14636	British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith released a statement on the case: "Following representations made on behalf of Mehdi Kazemi, and in the light of new circumstances since the original decision was made, I have decided that Mr. Kazemi's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK from the Netherlands."
SNT.101994.14637	Eighty members of Britain's upper house of Parliament sent a letter to Jacqui Smith, appealing to the government to "show compassion and allow Mr. Kazemi to have a safe haven in the United Kingdom."
SNT.101994.14638	Roger Roberts of the House of Lords initiated the petition, and stated: "There is no doubt that he will be persecuted and possibly face state-sanctioned murder if he is forced to return."
SNT.101994.14639	Simon Hughes, Member of Parliament for North Southwark and Bermondsey, said he would support Kazemi if he returns to the United Kingdom: "I hope Mr Kazemi will now come back to Britain where arrangements are already in place for an urgent meeting with him, his family, specialist lawyers and myself to prepare a new application to the Home Office."
SNT.101994.14640	Gay rights advocate and spokesman for the British gay rights group OutRage!, David Allison commented "It's cruel to even suggest sending him back …"
SNT.101994.14641	Ben Summerskill of the British gay rights organization, Stonewall, said: "We are obviously delighted that the home secretary has listened to the representations that were made in this case …"
SNT.101994.14642	"There are overwhelming reasons why people should not be deported to Iran in the current circumstances, and it is important that Britain is seen as a safe haven."
SNT.101994.14643	His uncle spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, and said that his nephew was studying in Britain in 2006 when his partner in Iran was arrested and hanged after being charged with sodomy.
SNT.101994.14644	Kazemi's uncle told CNN: "Under torture and pressure, (the partner) revealed Mehdi's name as his boyfriend."
SNT.101994.14645	Gay sex is considered a crime in Iran, and is punishable by death.
SNT.101994.14646	After Britain's Home Office initially denied Kazemi's asylum application, he fled to Canada and then the Netherlands, where he was detained.
SNT.101994.14647	Kazemi faces deportation from the Netherlands to Britain, after their highest court rejected his plea on Tuesday.
SNT.101994.14648	The Netherlands' highest court rejected the case, citing EU law that Kazemi's case was the responsibility of the country where he first requested asylum.
SNT.101994.14649	A resolution passed by the European Parliament Thursday asked EU states "to find a common solution to ensure that Mehdi Kazemi is granted asylum or protection on EU soil and not sent back to Iran."
SNT.101994.14650	The resolution also stated that Iranian authorities "routinely detain, torture and execute persons, notably homosexuals" and that "Mehdi's partner has already been executed, while his father has threatened him with death."
SNT.101994.14651	In a September 2007 speech at Columbia University, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was challenged by University president Lee Bollinger for Iran's treatment of gays.
SNT.101994.14652	Ahmadinejad stated that "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country," drawing laughter from the audience.
SNT.101994.14653	"In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it."
SNT.101994.14654	According to Iranian human rights activists, over 4,000 gay men and lesbians have been executed since the Iranian Revolution of 1979.
SNT.155407.14655	Belgian authorities have confirmed that at least eighteen people died in a head-on collision between two passenger trains in the suburbs of Brussels.
SNT.155407.14656	Other reports suggest that the death toll could be as high as 25.
SNT.155407.14657	More than 125 passengers are reported injured, 11 of them "very seriously".
SNT.155407.14658	Rescuers were still trying to free bodies from the wreckage of the trains more than eight hours after the crash, which occurred in snowy conditions at 08:28 local time (0728 UTC) near the station of Buizingen in the municipality of Halle, about 15 kilometres southwest of the Belgian capital.
SNT.155407.14659	The collision saw the first two carriages of one train being forced upwards into the air over the first carriage of the second train.
SNT.155407.14660	Eyewitnesses described the collision as "brutal", with passengers being thrown "violently" around the carriages.
SNT.155407.14661	Television footage showed the two smashed locomotives forced up in the air, with passenger cars strewn over a wide area and dazed survivors wandering at the crash site.
SNT.155407.14662	Train speed at the time of the crash was not immediately known.
SNT.155407.14663	There are reports that one of the trains ran a stop signal.
SNT.155407.14664	Initial reports suggest that the Leuven–Braine-le-Comte train was on the wrong line.
SNT.155407.14665	It is not known if the train went through a red signal or if there was a problem with the signalling.
SNT.155407.14666	A "well informed source" quoted by French-language daily Le Soir suggested that there might have been an electrical failure in the signalling system.
SNT.155407.14667	The collision occurred on one of the main access lines to Brussels-South station, about 14 kilometres (9 miles) from the Belgian capital.
SNT.155407.14668	It caused "major damage" to overhead power cables, especially on the Brussels–Mons and Brussels–Tournai lines, and high speed rail services between Brussels and France and the UK have been suspended.
SNT.155407.14669	Thalys services were temporarily halted due to the accident, with four of its trains in the region being diverted to alternative stations.
SNT.155407.14670	Thalys services between Brussels and Cologne have now resumed, but services to Amsterdam and Paris are still suspended.
SNT.155407.14671	One passenger on board, Christian Wampach, described conditions on board the train, "It was a nightmare."
SNT.155407.14672	"There were a number of people injured in my car but I think all the dead were in the first car."
SNT.155407.14673	Another passenger, Patricia Lallemand, said, "When we came out we saw dead bodies lying next to the tracks, some mutilated."
SNT.28929.14674	The famous Greek lawyers, Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos have been imprisoned in the Athens' jail of Korydallus, as they were found guilty of graft and corruption.
SNT.28929.14675	As a result of this, a big scandal within the Greek legal community has been raised through the exposure of illegal actions that judges, lawyers, solicitors and attorneys have done during the previous years.
SNT.28929.14676	A few weeks ago, after the information published by the journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos in his popular Television show "Zoungla" in Alpha TV, the member of Parliament and lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos was abdicated as members of his office had been involved in illegal graft and corruption.
SNT.28929.14677	Moreover, top judge Evangelos Kalousis is imprisoned as he found guilty of corruption and degenerate behaviour.
SNT.28929.14678	Except from journalists' research about scandals in the legal Community of Greece, accusations from well-known lawyers and attorneys such as the famous Athens' lawyer Alexis Kougias, against colleagues have as a result a greater dialogue and discussion in the country upon this important issue.
SNT.150749.14679	A decades-old building collapsed along Ma Tau Wai Road in Hong Kong at about 1:30pm on Friday, local time.
SNT.150749.14680	That building was located at 45J, Ma Tau Wai Road in Hung Hom.
SNT.150749.14681	A shop on its ground floor was undergoing renovations when the building collapsed.
SNT.150749.14682	Firefighters arrived at the scene to search survivors and they asked residents in the buildings nearby to evacuate the area.
SNT.150749.14683	Chief Executive Donald Tsang called for an investigation into the cause of the building collapse.
SNT.150749.14684	The government required all old buildings with similar structures to undergo inspection, according to Secretary for Development Carrie Lam.
SNT.150749.14685	The government has confirmed that four people were dead in the incident.
SNT.150749.14686	Rescue efforts ended on Saturday morning when the government confirmed that no one was missing.
SNT.150749.14687	Lam visited the scene on Saturday afternoon and sought advice from the police and Buildings Department.
SNT.150749.14688	Secretary for Labour & Welfare Matthew Cheung said that the government would do its best to meet the victims' needs.
SNT.150749.14689	The government had inspected its five-storey structure before the incident and had ordered repairs.
SNT.150749.14690	After the tragedy, the government announced that it would inspect buildings older than 50 years in one month.
SNT.150749.14691	The government has restricted access to buildings at 45G and 45H as they were in danger.
SNT.77827.14692	Thoroughbred horse racing has been cancelled indefinitely in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland due to an outbreak of Equine Influenza.
SNT.77827.14693	An Australia-wide ban on the movement of horses, donkeys and mules which was due to expire on Wednesday has been extended until Friday.
SNT.77827.14694	So far the virus only appears to have infected horses in NSW and Queensland, with 51 confirmed cases and another 400 suspected.
SNT.77827.14695	So far all those infected appear to be horses used for recreational purposes and not thoroughbred race horses.
SNT.77827.14696	Despite the bans on racing and horse movements, track work will recommence in NSW and Queensland today.
SNT.77827.14697	It had been feared yesterday that four race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney had been struck down by the virus, but the horses later tested negative to the virus.
SNT.77827.14698	If an outbreak were to occur at Randwick it could affect up to 700 race horses stabled there.
SNT.77827.14699	The outbreak comes at a bad time for the industry, as it prepares for the lucrative spring racing season in Sydney and Melbourne.
SNT.77827.14700	The AUD$1 million Golden Rose event at Rosehill has been cancelled, although it is expected that Melbourne's spring racing carnival will resume on Saturday as no cases of the flu have been seen in Victoria.
SNT.77827.14701	Racing Victoria has also said the Melbourne Cup will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak, even if no interstate or international horses can attend.
SNT.77827.14702	Despite fines of up to $44,000 and 12 months imprisonment in NSW there have been reports that more than 100 horse owners have been caught moving their horses.
SNT.77827.14703	The NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald, said it was "absolutely vital that no-one moves a horse in this state".
SNT.77827.14704	"We will be working with police to ensure horses are at a standstill," he said.
SNT.77827.14705	The racing bans have cost gaming companies Tabcorp and Tattersall's millions, with Tabcorp losing $65 million in revenue on the weekend.
SNT.77827.14706	Tabcorp expects to lose around $150 million in turnover this week.
SNT.77827.14707	Tattersall's has also said it expects to lose around $2 million in revenue per week due to the outbreak.
SNT.77827.14708	Investors reacted to the news, slashing 3 percent of the price of Tattersall's shares and over 4 percent of those of Tabcorp.
SNT.19381.14709	Relatively unknown Indiana Senator Evan Bayh is taking steps to make a run for U.S. President during the 2008 election cycle.
SNT.19381.14710	Bayh has formed a political action committee (PAC) and already is a leading money-raiser among Democratic party hopefuls.
SNT.19381.14711	The Hoosier politician also is touting his appeal to traditionally republican voters.
SNT.31091.14712	Australia's coastwatch has found a missing boat which with more than 40 passengers after it had left Indonesia's Papua province, reportedly bound for Australia.
SNT.31091.14713	Initial reports say the vessel has been spotted off Cape York, three days after it was reported missing.
SNT.31091.14714	The Australia West Papua Association (AWPA) says the boat was carrying people who left for security reasons as a campaign against Indonesian rule of the Melanesian province continues.
SNT.31091.14715	Any application for possible asylum can only be submitted to the Australian authorities if they reach the Australian mainland.
SNT.31091.14716	Australia operates a detention centre in Nauru to process people intercepted at sea while trying to reach Australia illegally.
SNT.31091.14717	The AWPA said the group had been forced to flee Papua by boat because the usual way of leaving the province — by crossing the eastern border into Papua New Guinea — had been made more difficult by increased surveillance.
SNT.31091.14718	"No one (has) come from West Papua in boats before like this, seeking political asylum," said a spokesperson for AWPA.
SNT.31091.14719	Fears for the safety of the asylum-seekers mounted over the weekend after the group failed to turn up on Australia's Cape York Peninsula after leaving Papua's Merauke port on Friday morning.
SNT.31091.14720	The group had reportedly been making the 250 kilometre journey across the Torres Strait in a 25-metre traditional boat.
SNT.31091.14721	"A vessel fitting the information reported was located by Coastwatch at about 2pm at Cape York," an immigration department spokeswoman told AFP.
SNT.31091.14722	Customs and government officials were on their way to meet the boat, she added.
SNT.74599.14723	The plane reportedly skidded off the wet runway, crossed a busy thoroughfare before careening into a fuel depot and warehouse ultimately bursting into flames.
SNT.74599.14724	"The plane accelerated when it reached the end of the runway and tried to take off again to avoid the road, but it crashed into the building and exploded," Junior Matos told AFP.
SNT.74599.14725	Authorities believe that all 180 people onboard the plane have died, and a further 15 people on the ground are feared dead as well.
SNT.74599.14726	Low clouds and heavy rain were reported at the time of the crash.
SNT.74599.14727	Additionally, the runway has had a history of problems with standing water.
SNT.74599.14728	Neither of these factors have been linked to the cause of the crash at this point.
SNT.74599.14729	Rodrigo Pinho, state attorney, said the authorities will thoroughly investigate "to determine the cause and to identify who was responsible".
SNT.73471.14730	With the announcement Monday of €2 million in new funding from the European Union (EU), the Republic of Djibouti's Ministry of Agriculture hopes to provide some relief to an estimated 25,000 rural inhabitants suffering through severe drought conditions.
SNT.73471.14731	The money, to be channeled through UNICEF for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones.
SNT.73471.14732	UNICEF is to contribute a further €60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work.
SNT.73471.14733	At the same time, the UN aid agency World Food Program (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability.
SNT.73471.14734	"What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields," said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman.
SNT.73471.14735	"And, together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, we will try and promote vegetable gardens."
SNT.73471.14736	Djibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years.
SNT.73471.14737	Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated.
SNT.73471.14738	Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water.
SNT.73471.14739	And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited.
SNT.73471.14740	Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially.
SNT.73471.14741	Nearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock.
SNT.73471.14742	As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent.
SNT.73471.14743	Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle.
SNT.73471.14744	"Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here," said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli.
SNT.73471.14745	A 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination.
SNT.73471.14746	Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project.
SNT.73471.14747	“WFP couldn’t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,” said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti.
SNT.73471.14748	When the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps.
SNT.73471.14749	"The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance," said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist.
SNT.73471.14750	"We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations."
SNT.73471.14751	"The government’s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible," he added.
SNT.128011.14752	NASA launched the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program space probes, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) on board the Atlas V rocket at 5:32 p.m. EDT (2132 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
SNT.128011.14753	Due to nearby thunderstorms the launch was delayed about 20 minutes from the scheduled launch time of 5.12 p.m. EDT (2112 GMT).
SNT.128011.14754	The mission will be NASA's first unmanned rocket expedition to the moon in a decade.
SNT.128011.14755	The aim of the LRO mission is to spend at least a year in a low polar orbit above the surface of the moon to gather neccesary data for future missions and longer lunar expeditions.
SNT.128011.14756	It will be orbiting approximately 30 miles (48 km) above the moon, trying to find safe landing sites, locating potential resources, characterizing the radiation environment and testing new technology.
SNT.128011.14757	The 2,300 pounds (1,043 kg) spent upper stage Centaur motor of the Atlas V launch vehicle will strike the surface of the moon at 9,000 km/h (5,600 mph) resulting in a 350 ton (317 metric ton) plume of debris rising between 6 to 30 miles (10 to 48 km) above the moon's surface.
SNT.128011.14758	From this impact, scientists hope to be able to detect any water ice or vapor using the LCROSS satellite which will crash land nearby four minutes later.
SNT.128011.14759	Astronomers who own amateur-class telescopes with apertures as small as 10 to 12 inches may be able to sight the ejecta cloud as it will have a period of brightness about one minute after impact.
SNT.128011.14760	The launch was originally planned for yesterday, but delayed for the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which was itself later delayed again due to another hydrogen fuel leak.
SNT.46517.14761	Around twelve people were killed in Iraq today while they were playing football on a makeshift pitch in a predominantly Shi'a area in west Baghdad.
SNT.46517.14762	According to police, two bombs, which had been planted in the middle of the pitch, were detonated.
SNT.46517.14763	Earlier today, Iraq’s President revealed Iraqi troops would take over safekeeping of the entire country from American troops by the end of 2006.
SNT.46517.14764	He said the takeover would occur gradually but would be complete by the start of 2007.
SNT.46517.14765	Yesterday, more than fifty people were killed across the country.
SNT.10690.14766	King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has been admitted to a hospital in Riyadh for testing.
SNT.10690.14767	Unofficial sources say that the King, who has been ill since 1995, might have "water in his lungs", possibly indicating pneumonia.
SNT.10690.14768	Crown Prince Abdullah has performed most of the duties of the aging monarch in recent years, and is a very likely candidate for succession of the throne should King Fahd succumb to his illness.
SNT.103804.14769	This week saw the English-language version of Wikipedia, the collaboratively written online encyclopedia, reach 2,000 featured articles with the inclusion of the article El Señor Presidente.
SNT.103804.14770	Featured articles (FAs) meet Wikipedia's highest standards for quality, accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style, and thus are considered the best articles on Wikipedia.
SNT.103804.14771	The Wikipedia team that carries out the assessment and quality control before conferring the status of featured articles promoted five articles to FA status at the same time: Walter de Coventre, Maximian, El Señor Presidente, Lord of the Universe, and Red-billed Chough.
SNT.103804.14772	With five promoted at the same time, conferring the status of 2,000th on one is an arbitrary decision and in some respects any of these articles could actually make a claim to the honour.
SNT.103804.14773	The professor of the class, Jon Beasley-Murray, began using Wikipedia as a collaborative space where his students could both do coursework and provide a type of virtual public service.
SNT.103804.14774	Thus, he created a Wikipedia project, Murder Madness and Mayhem, that focussed on creating articles relating to the Latin American literature covered in his class.
SNT.103804.14775	The Wikinews team contacted Prof. Beasley-Murray, who agreed to be interviewed for this story.
SNT.103804.14776	Thus far the project has created seven good articles in addition to the 2,000th featured article.
SNT.28592.14777	After he had repeated this publicly, he was arrested and charged with apostasy.
SNT.28592.14778	Iranian authorities later claimed he was jailed for spying for Israel, but this was contradicted by the court documents.
SNT.28592.14779	They say they hold the Iranian authorities responsible for his death and his only crime was belief in his religion.
SNT.229141.14780	The United States Border Patrol has announced that a Border agent, Brian Terry aged 40, was shot and killed in Southern Arizona near the border with Mexico on Tuesday night after a shoot out with suspected bandits who were targeting illegal immigrants.
SNT.229141.14781	Reports state that at least four suspects are in custody with one suspect still at large.
SNT.229141.14782	Terry was killed at around 11:00 p.m. local time (PST) Tuesday night near Rio Rico.
SNT.229141.14783	Border Patrol spokesman Eric Cantu told the Associated Press that the FBI is probing the agent's death and had few details at the time.
SNT.229141.14784	Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Protection also released a statement saying, "Our thoughts and prayers are with the Terry family for their tragic loss."
SNT.229141.14785	"Our commitment to Agent Terry and his family is that we will do everything possible to bring to justice those responsible for this despicable act."
SNT.229141.14786	U.S. flags across Arizona will be flown at half-staff in honor of Terry.
SNT.159678.14787	Local government officials have said that at least eleven people were killed on Sunday in southern Afghanistan by a roadside bomb.
SNT.159678.14788	The governor's spokesman, Daud Ahmadi, said to media that "a civilian car struck a roadside bomb in Nawzad district."
SNT.159678.14789	According to the spokesman, a family was riding on a tractor with a truck-bed hitched on back, when it hit the explosives on a central road; all of the people aboard died, including two children and two women.
SNT.159678.14790	The incident comes several weeks after soldiers from the US, NATO, and Afghanistan, initiated an offensive against the Taleban in Helmand's Marjah and Nad Ali areas on February 13.
SNT.9609.14791	On the same day that the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum was opened this year, a lesser-known museum and educational center was opened by a Muslim man in the Israeli town of Nazareth.
SNT.9609.14792	This unique museum, intended to raise awareness of past Jewish suffering in the eyes of Palestinians through historical photographs and Arabic-language educational materials, is believed to be the first-ever Arab holocaust museum.
SNT.9609.14793	Nazareth is of course well-known to Christians as the site where Joseph and Mary brought up the child Jesus.
SNT.9609.14794	In modern times, Nazareth is the largest Arab town in Israel, having many self-proclaimed Palestinians, a Muslim majority, and a 35% Arab-Christian minority.
SNT.9609.14795	The museum's owner Khaleed Mahameed, a 43-year old lawyer, husband, and father of two, said that he learned about the holocaust during his time at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
SNT.9609.14796	He spent about 20,000 shekels (US$4,500) of his own money in order to create the museum, despite the alienation of his own brother, the rejection of the Arab news media, and a public that is slow to accept his ideas.
SNT.9609.14797	Mahameed purchased about 80 photographs from the more well-known museum at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, site of Israel's national memorial to the Shoah (holocaust), located on the Har Hazikaron (Mount of Remembrance).
SNT.9609.14798	The newly enlarged Israeli museum at Yad Vashem, opened March 15 with the attendance of President Moshe Katsav, replaced what was the world's first holocaust museum, established in 1972.
SNT.9609.14799	As part of his effort to educate Palestinians, Mahameed has printed 2,000 booklets in Arabic describing photographs of Nazi horrors, offered stipends to Arab students of the subject, and started a new museum website (Alkaritha.org) with some translations offered in English, Arabic, and Hebrew.
SNT.9609.14800	Mahameed believes contributions such as his are necessary to the Mideast peace effort.
SNT.9609.14801	"Understanding this and the fact that personal security is perhaps the major concern of Jews in Israel and elsewhere, as a direct outcome of the Holocaust and the feelings of persecution, is extremely important."
SNT.9609.14802	"If we, as Arabs, can dissipate these concerns and show understanding over what happened it will help create the climate for real dialogue in which Israeli Jews and especially decision-makers will be able to have a greater understanding of the suffering of Arab citizens and the Palestinians."
SNT.9609.14803	"This, in turn, would hopefully lead towards a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and an end to discriminatory policies towards Arab citizens and the acceptance that they deserve equal rights."
SNT.9609.14804	Mahameed is not without his critics, not only among Arabs who say that Mahameed should do more to draw attention to the situation of present-day Palestinians, but also representatives of the Israel office of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who have stated without visiting the museum that they consider some of the attitudes expressed on Mahameed's website to be anti-Semitic.
SNT.9609.14805	"The establishment of the first Holocaust museum for the Arabic-speaking public can be an important first step in educating the Arab world on the unique horrors of the destruction of European Jewry."
SNT.9609.14806	"Particularly now, at a time when Holocaust denial is rife both within and outside of the Arab world, the attempt to teach young Arabs about the Holocaust and to learn moral and ethical lessons from it is a worthy pursuit."
SNT.9609.14807	"If however, the Arab Institute for Holocaust Research and Education is, as noted on its Web site, ideologically grounded in the belief that it was the Palestinian people who paid the price for European guilt over the Holocaust by imposing what they believe is an illegitimate Jewish state in the heart of the Arab world then the institute will merely propagate the classic anti-Israel use of the Holocaust and promote anti-Semitism."
SNT.9609.14808	Friday was Yom Hashoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel, a day of solemn reflection on the loss of 5 to 7 million Jewish lives due to unprovoked Nazi aggression in World War II.
SNT.9609.14809	Images, films and documentaries of the Holocaust are typically broadcast throughout the Israeli news media on that day, deeply affecting the survivors and their children.
SNT.9609.14810	However, these images do not typically reach a Palestinian audience, according to museum visitor Mufeed Khattib last month.
SNT.9609.14811	"Perhaps I didn't see it well because it was on Israeli TV," he said.
SNT.9609.14812	"It is different for me that an Arab man did this."
SNT.17064.14813	On CNN's Anderson Cooper-hosted 360 Degrees program, former British Prime Minister John Major said, "I think it's now patently apparent that there are people in the United Kingdom (who) are alienated from the Anglo-Saxon way of life and are prepared to indulge in these dreadful acts of criminality."
SNT.17064.14814	Ekow Eshun of the Newstatesman writes that Major's comments belong on the dustheap of history along with cricket.
SNT.17064.14815	The former British leader has also been recently quoted as saying in reference to the Brazilian citizen killed by police; "I rather prefer the expression shoot to protect rather than shoot to kill — I think that is a more accurate description of what happened."
SNT.17064.14816	In addition Sir John has come out as an advocate of deportation for people who express distaste for the "Anglo-Saxon way of life".
SNT.17064.14817	The Saudi ambassador to London, Prince Turki al-Faisal, is voicing the same position as Major regarding the need for deporting some of the Muslim clerics.
SNT.17064.14818	In the 1960s there was born a somewhat similar "America, love it or leave it" viewpoint among American conservatives, a viewpoint that is still the subject of debate today.
SNT.59277.14819	Villagers near the town of Goroka in the jungle-covered highlands about 400 kilometres north of the capital Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea killed four women they believed to be witches.
SNT.59277.14820	They tortured the women by stabbing them with hot rods so they would confess to causing a road crash using sorcery.
SNT.59277.14821	The accident had resulted in the death of three prison guards.
SNT.59277.14822	With the help of some village elders, police have now discovered these murders which occurred in October of last year.
SNT.59277.14823	BBC News reports human rights campaigners saying that it is not uncommon in Papua New Guinea for women suspected of engaging in black magic to be killed, often by hanging or burning.
SNT.61027.14824	New Zealand's national airline, Air New Zealand has announced that they will be flying direct to Canada.
SNT.61027.14825	Flights from Auckland to Vancouver will operate three times a week between November and March, to coincide with the peak travel season between the two destinations, as Canadians escape winter and New Zealand skiers head to the Canadian slopes.
SNT.61027.14826	46,000 Canadians visit New Zealand and 16,000 New Zealanders visit Canada each year, starting at the end of this year.
SNT.61027.14827	The reinstatement of the Vancouver link restores a route phased out in the 1990s.
SNT.61027.14828	Canadian visitors make up two percent of international visitor arrivals, however they stay longer and spend more in New Zealand than many other visitors spent an average of 29 days in New Zealand in 2006, and spent almost $3400 each.
SNT.61027.14829	In total, they contributed $136 million to New Zealand's economy.
SNT.61027.14830	Tourism New Zealand chief executive, George Hickton has said that the direct flights will make New Zealand look much more appealing to the Canadian market.
SNT.61027.14831	The Tourism Industry Association New Zealand say that the new route has the added benefit of freeing up seats on Air New Zealand's busy routes from San Francisco and Los Angeles.
SNT.23826.14832	This unusual hurricane season, one of the most active in history, has produced another strange storm.
SNT.23826.14833	Category 1 Hurricane Vince, which was formed from a non-tropical low today, is forecast to head east towards Portugal, rather than west as is usual.
SNT.23826.14834	Vince caught forecasters by surprise, since the waters in the area are around 25ºC.
SNT.23826.14835	Few expected Vince to even form in the cool waters, much less to become a hurricane.
SNT.23826.14836	Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center do not expect Vince to be a hurricane for long.
SNT.23826.14837	It is forecast to weaken as it moves towards Portugal, and to finally become extratropical.
SNT.23826.14838	In about 48 hours, they believe Vince will be absorbed by a front in Portugal or Spain.
SNT.190839.14839	A rescue operation is underway after sixteen-year-old American Abby Sunderland, attempting to sail around the world by herself, lost contact with her family while in the Indian Ocean.
SNT.190839.14840	Sunderland, from Thousand Oaks, California, had originally hoped to become the youngest person to sail around the world nonstop by herself.
SNT.190839.14841	She departed from Marina del Rey, California on January 23, 2010 and was about halfway through the attempt when Sunderland's family lost communication with her Thursday morning.
SNT.190839.14842	That night, an Australian plane was able to locate her 40-foot (12.2-metre) long boat, Wild Eyes, which had lost its mast earlier.
SNT.190839.14843	Sunderland had been sailing amid a rough storm in the Indian Ocean early Thursday when her boat was flipped over.
SNT.190839.14844	After losing contact, the teenager activated two manual distress radiobeacons, or EPIRBs, and a search-and-rescue operation was formed.
SNT.190839.14845	As part of the operation, a Qantas Airways Airbus A330 was sent over the ocean by Australian authorities.
SNT.190839.14846	The plane's crew was able to make radio contact with Sunderland, and confirmed that she was not injured and that her boat was upright, but was unable to continue sailing.
SNT.190839.14847	The closest rescue boat, a French fishing ship, was about 24 hours away from Sunderland's location when she was found, and is expected to meet her later today.
SNT.190839.14848	She was stranded about 2000 miles (3218.7 kilometres) southwest of Australia's coast.
SNT.190839.14849	Near the beginning of the voyage, she made a stop at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, after the boat's generators were not producing enough power.
SNT.190839.14850	She resumed the attempt in February, but autopilot problems forced another stop at Cape Town, South Africa for repairs in April, and she had to give up going for the unassisted record.
SNT.190839.14851	Sunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, have vigorously defended against claims that their daughter was too young to be attempting such a feat.
SNT.190839.14852	They have also been criticized for allowing her to depart the United States at the beginning of the year, because Sunderland would likely arrive in the Indian Ocean during the region's winter.
SNT.190839.14853	Marianne Sunderland has said that Abby would likely not try "something of this magnitude again."
SNT.190839.14854	Last year, her brother Zac had completed a circumnavigation when he sailed solo around the world at the age of seventeen.
SNT.190839.14855	She had begun preparing for this journey at the age of thirteen.
SNT.248548.14856	With development of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) browser almost complete, Microsoft announced on Friday that it is time for IE6 users to move away from the antiquated 10-year-old browser.
SNT.248548.14857	On a new website, "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown", Microsoft has launched an aggressive campaign to persuade users to stop using IE6 and update to a newer IE.
SNT.248548.14858	Its goal is to decrease IE6 users to less than one percent.
SNT.248548.14859	IE's various versions accounted for 70 percent of the market in 2009; this has dropped to approximately 56 percent today.
SNT.248548.14860	Mozilla Firefox, its main rival, has been actively increasing its market share while the recently released Google Chrome is also quickly gaining users.
SNT.248548.14861	PC World's recent analysis of its own web traffic statistics concluded, "Usually, Internet Explorer is the #2 browser after Firefox, but over the past 30 days it's been #3, a couple of points behind Safari-and nearly tied with Chrome."
SNT.248548.14862	"But if it isn't, and Chrome continues to surge, IE could fall to fourth place."
SNT.248548.14863	As they design their web pages for the newer browsers with advanced web technology and geared to the newest web core markup language HTML 5, they are forced to accommodate older out-of-date technology to support IE6 users.
SNT.248548.14864	Also, not mentioned on Microsoft's "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown" site, are the numerous security vulnerabilities putting the browser at risk of being hacked.
SNT.248548.14865	The Internet security firm Secunia.com, has said that as of March 4, 2011, IE6 has 277 vulnerabilities; 39 percent of these are rated "highly critical".
SNT.248548.14866	Microsoft says that the latest versions of Internet Explorer provide the user with enhanced protection from these attacks and threats.
SNT.248548.14867	Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most successful software products ever as measured by its durability and the massive numbers of people who have used it.
SNT.248548.14868	But it has outlived its usefulness, and Microsoft no longer wants to support it.
SNT.23986.14869	As the start date of the former Iraqi leader's trial approaches, the chief judge of the tribunal has stated that the fate of Saddam Hussein will be broadcast on live television.
SNT.23986.14870	In a statement to CNN, Iraqi national security advisor Muwaffaq Rubaie said that "...this is going to be a fair, just trial with a defense counsel in there, with a proper prosecuting counsel as well there..."
SNT.23986.14871	The first charge, filed earlier this month, alleges Hussein's responsibility in the 1982 killing of 143 residents of Dujail, in which he was the target of a botched assassination attempt.
SNT.23986.14872	The tribunal, which was set up in December 2003, has been marred by delays.
SNT.23986.14873	There are accusations of bias from the defense counsel of Hussein, as well as fears for the judges' safety which have consistently pushed the trial back.
SNT.23986.14874	The defense team has challenged the tribunal's legitimacy and stated they have not been given enough time to prepare.
SNT.23986.14875	This concern has been echoed in the past by some human rights groups, "It's really critical that it's done right," says Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
SNT.23986.14876	"For those who believe in international justice and accountability for human rights crimes, the trial of Saddam Hussein is a rare opportunity to test the system and make it work."
SNT.23986.14877	Many Iraqis, particularly Shia and Kurdish, want to see Hussein tried for chemical gas attacks on the Kurds in the 1980s.
SNT.23986.14878	In 1988, one of these chemical attacks killed as many as 5,000 people.
SNT.23986.14879	As well, many Iraqis want Hussein punished for reprisals against a Shia uprising in 1991.
SNT.23986.14880	The trial is set to begin on Wednesday, October 19th.
SNT.111633.14881	United States Presidential candidates Senators Barack Obama and John McCain each participated in a live forum broadcast from Saddleback Church in Lake Forest.
SNT.111633.14882	The forum, moderated by pastor Rick Warren, was scheduled to showcase the candidates to an evangelical segment of the population, who account for 26.3% of the American public.
SNT.111633.14883	During the forum the candidates were each individually asked a series of identical questions by the pastor, with Senator Barack Obama going first and Senator John McCain taking his turn second.
SNT.111633.14884	Senator McCain traveled to the church and waited in a green room while Obama was speaking, and by agreement did not listen to the questions or Senator Obama's responses.
SNT.111633.14885	When asked whom they believed were the three wisest people to rely on as president, Obama answered that his wife and grandmother were at the top of his list along with a mix of Republican and Democratic Senators.
SNT.111633.14886	McCain comprised his list of a range of people: the architect of the troop surge in Iraq, General David Petraeus; Democratic Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis; and the former CEO of eBay, Meg Whitman.
SNT.111633.14887	In response to being questioned about their toughest decisions in life, Obama answered that deciding to oppose the Iraq War in 2002 was his toughest, while McCain cited his refusal to leave his men behind in a POW camp in Vietnam when given the chance.
SNT.111633.14888	On some philosophical questions the candidates differed in their moral stances.
SNT.111633.14889	When asked when they believed individuals should be given human rights, Obama responded that the question was "above [his] pay grade" while McCain decisively replied that he believed it should occur "at the moment of conception."
SNT.111633.14890	On the concept of evil, Obama related it to the situation in Darfur and on America's streets.
SNT.111633.14891	McCain related it to radical Islamic extremism relaying that he believed evil should be "defeated."
SNT.111633.14892	He then promised that as president he would hunt Osama bin Laden to the "gates of hell."
SNT.111633.14893	They both answered that the biggest moral dilemmas in their lives were personal mistakes they had made when they were younger.
SNT.111633.14894	For Obama, it was his drug use, for McCain it was his failed first marriage.
SNT.111633.14895	Both candidates were on the stage together briefly between the interviews and shook hands and hugged in a moment symbolic of Warren's call for civility at the beginning and end of the forum.
SNT.123362.14896	The World Health Organisation (WHO) has stated that the cholera outbreak that has struck the African country of Zimbabwe seems to have passed its peak.
SNT.123362.14897	The WHO said that "while data collection and verification remain a challenge throughout the country with the effect that weekly statistics are not always accurate or complete, the overall trend over the last 2 months is of a decreasing number of cases and deaths."
SNT.123362.14898	"The overall trend over the last two months is of a decreasing number of cases and deaths," the WHO said.
SNT.123362.14899	The number of new cholera cases in the week ending March 14 was 2,076, almost half of the 3,812 infections reported the week before, and 8,000 per week in the beginning of February.
SNT.123362.14900	The WHO stated that the fatality rate per week dropped from a peak of 6% in January to 2.3% this month.
SNT.123362.14901	91,164 total cases were reported as of March 17 since the epidemic started in August of last year, with a total of 4,307 deaths.
SNT.123362.14902	The cholera epidemic is the deadliest in Africa for a decade and a half.
SNT.77796.14903	US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, after several months of controversy, today announced his resignation after 13 years of public service.
SNT.77796.14904	While he did not elaborate on the circumstances of his departure, he referred to his tenure as a "remarkable journey" and said he had "lived the American dream."
SNT.77796.14905	Critics of the embattled Attorney General have called for his ousting for several months, largely over his conflicts with the US Congress over the Bush Administration's warrant-less wiretapping program, and his firing of nine US attorneys.
SNT.77796.14906	Observers have expressed surprise at the sudden announcement, as Gonzales had said as recently as the weekend of the 18th of August that he had planned to stay through the end of President Bush's second term.
SNT.77796.14907	Critics of the Attorney General, most notably Harry Reid, majority leader for the US Senate, have welcomed the announcement, as Gonzales had been one of the most controversial members of the Bush Administration.
SNT.77796.14908	President Bush spoke on his "close friend's" resignation saying that he has reluctantly accepted the resignation, but noted that Gonzales' name had been "dragged through the mud for political reasons."
SNT.77796.14909	Throughout the recent controversy Bush has stood next to Gonzales.
SNT.77796.14910	Paul Clement, the current Solicitor General, will serve as the acting Attorney General until a replacement has been confirmed by the Senate.
SNT.128371.14911	The Peel P50, a single door, three wheel microcar went on display at New York's Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum on Monday.
SNT.128371.14912	The Peel Engineering Company manufactured 50 to 100 of the one-seater vehicles which weighed 130 lb (59 kg), and are 52.8 in (134 cm) in length, 47 in (120 cm) in height and 39 in (99 cm) in width.
SNT.128371.14913	The little car can travel as fast as 38 mph (61 kph), and comes equipped with a handle on the car so the driver can pull the car to back up.
SNT.128371.14914	Only twenty of the vehicles have survived since 1963, and the original price of £199 has soared to approximately £40,000 (US$ 65,000) today.
SNT.276052.14915	Former governor of New York Hugh Carey has died at the age of 92.
SNT.276052.14916	Carey was the 51st governor of the state and held office from 1975 until 1982 as a Democrat.
SNT.276052.14917	During his tenure he held more power over the finances of New York City than any other governor, before or after Carey's term.
SNT.276052.14918	He saw the city through the financial crisis of the 1970's.
SNT.276052.14919	The office of current governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced the death.
SNT.276052.14920	In a statement, Cuomo said “Governor Carey led our state during a time of great financial turmoil and pulled us back from the brink of bankruptcy and economic ruin.”
SNT.276052.14921	Carey ran for Governor during the 1974 election after being urged by his wife Helen.
SNT.276052.14922	Helen was battling cancer and died 18 days before Carey announced his intentions to run.
SNT.276052.14923	During his first year in office, the state was in a financial crisis and banks had stopped giving the city access to credit due to a $5 billion deficit.
SNT.276052.14924	He managed to come to a agreement with the bankers that heavy spending cuts needed to be made.
SNT.276052.14925	Carey was a father of 14 children and grandfather to 25.
SNT.276052.14926	Two of his sons died in a car accident in 1969.
SNT.276052.14927	Another son, Paul became a commissioner for the Securities Exchange Commission and died in 2001 after a battle with cancer.
SNT.58151.14928	Prince Laurent of Belgium, the youngest son of King Albert II of Belgium, has been questioned last night by the federal police and is attending today's court session in Hasselt in a marine fraud case that has gripped Belgian media since last December.
SNT.58151.14929	He arrived in a Smart car and was accompanied by his lawyer and former politician Fred Erdman.
SNT.58151.14930	The case turns around funds of the Belgian Navy that have been used to beautify the Prince's villa in Tervuren.
SNT.58151.14931	In total, € 2.2 million was supposedly diverted from the marine's purchasing services using false invoices.
SNT.58151.14932	Roughly € 185 000 was allegedly used to paint the Prince's villa, install lights in the garden, for the purchase of carpet and furniture, and for his secretariat and for animal clinics the Prince supports via his Foundation.
SNT.58151.14933	Twelve marine officers and contractors are being accused of document fraud, collusion, bribery, embezzlement of government money etc. and could face 10 years in prison.
SNT.58151.14934	The money was part of the budget that wasn't spent at the end of the year, and which would flow back to the government if the army didn't spend it.
SNT.58151.14935	The Prince, who is also an officer in the navy, is being treated only as a witness in this case, there have been no charges against him.
SNT.58151.14936	The Attorney General in Hasselt Marc Rubens has said that there are no elements in the investigation that point to the fact that Laurent was aware of the affair, however several accused have contested this in the press.
SNT.58151.14937	Technically, the villa is not the property of the Prince himself, but of the Royal Gift, which manages the real property of the Royal Family.
SNT.58151.14938	During his interview by the police last night, Prince Laurent stated that he needed funds to renovate his villa, and that Noël Vaessen, his adviser, told him the Navy could help him.
SNT.58151.14939	The Prince stated that he thought it was legal, and that he had no reason to doubt his adviser.
SNT.58151.14940	Vaessen has declared in the media during the last month that the Prince actively participated in the fraud, and that he fears a cover-up.
SNT.58151.14941	He said that the Prince was a demanding party in the operation, and that "he knew that we were arranging things to make his life and his work as comfortable as possible."
SNT.58151.14942	According to Vaessen, the Prince was in need of money to support a royal lifestyle, and "didn't even have enough money to buy food."
SNT.58151.14943	In 2001, Vaessen was discharged with honour from the army "for medical reasons", but Defence Minister André Flahaut is investigating if there was no agreement to give him his pension in exchange for the fact that he wouldn't incriminate the Prince.
SNT.58151.14944	Vaessen also accused the Prince of other things, such as racing against the high-speed train TGV on a French highway.
SNT.58151.14945	Captain Johan Claeys, one of the accused, studied with the Prince and worked at the facturation services of the Navy in 1998 and 1999.
SNT.58151.14946	One of the accused contractors, Marc Luypaerts, has told the press that the judge responsible for the investigation in Hasselt had forbidden him to speak about Prince Laurent.
SNT.58151.14947	Laurent's status as a Prince has several judicial consequences for the trial.
SNT.58151.14948	In Belgium, it's against the law to incriminate the Royal Family during a trial.
SNT.58151.14949	Also, the Prince is protected from judicial pursuit because he is also a Senator by law.
SNT.58151.14950	Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx has issued a Royal Decrete, which the King has signed while on holiday in Napels, which would make it possible for Princes to testify in a trial.
SNT.58151.14951	However, Public Prosecutor Erwin Steyls has chosen to have Laurent interrogated by the police last night in Hasselt.
SNT.58151.14952	This was the first time during the last six years of the inquiry that the Prince was questioned.
SNT.58151.14953	Today in the court, the Prosecutor defended the act of having him questioned outside the trial, saying that there were several procedural issues.
SNT.58151.14954	First, the subpoena for the Prince wasn't issued in time to be legal.
SNT.58151.14955	Second, the details of the protocol to hear the Prince in court were not explained in the recent Royal Decrete, making it worthless -something Minister Onkelickx denied.
SNT.58151.14956	Thirdly, nobody can be forced to testify against himself, and if the Prince were to make false statements under oath, he could only be sued for perjury.
SNT.58151.14957	However, the court has decided to let him testify anyway this afternoon.
SNT.58151.14958	During the last month, the case has caused a several spin-off discussions in Belgium.
SNT.58151.14959	One of the surprises during this period was the King's Christmas Message, in which he referred to the case.
SNT.58151.14960	The regional governments are now investigating and discussing their donations to the IRGT/KINT, an environmental organisation supported by Prince Laurent.
SNT.58151.14961	But there is also an ongoing debate over the position of the Monarchy in Belgium.
SNT.58151.14962	Some politicians are suggesting to limit the role of the Monarchy, and other think that only the King and Queen, the Crown Prince or Princess and the widow(er) of the King or Queen should receive state funding.
SNT.899.14963	Controversy was sparked by his choice of conservative Italian Rocco Buttiglione for the Justice Commissioner position, who made several statements regarding homosexuality and women that members of the European Parliament objected to.
SNT.899.14964	The European Parliament voted in favour the Commissioners on November 18th, giving Barroso and his staff the green light to start their official five-year term starting on Monday.
SNT.899.14965	While the Greens, Eurosceptics and the Communist Party voted against, the Commission secured the approval of the Parliament's biggest parties - the Socialists, the Liberals and the European People's Party.
SNT.899.14966	The vote ended with 449 in favour, 149 against and 82 abstentions, CNN reports.
SNT.159837.14967	According to senior officials in the Obama administration, the U.S. is to significantly and permanently reduce its stockpile of nuclear weapons by thousands of weapons as part of a major rethinking of American nuclear policy.
SNT.159837.14968	The move is coming as part of a major policy review intended to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world.
SNT.159837.14969	According to an unnamed official, the review "will point to dramatic reductions in the stockpile, while maintaining a strong and reliable deterrent."
SNT.159837.14970	As part of the new policy, conventional weapons will have a greater role in the future.
SNT.159837.14971	According to officials, there are thousands of weapons that could be retired, largely by eliminating those currently stored.
SNT.159837.14972	The move comes as a significant step towards Obama's stated goal of reducing and eventually ending the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide.
SNT.159837.14973	The policy changes come as part of the Nuclear Posture Review, a document which is undertaken by all presidents.
SNT.159837.14974	In addition to the reduction of nuclear weapons, Obama's review will also adjust the United States' defense towards non-nuclear options, including missile defense, largely within striking distance of the Persian Gulf to reduce the threat posed by countries such as Iran.
SNT.159837.14975	A centerpiece of the new policy is a new plan called the "Prompt Global Strike," which involves a new type of conventional weapon that could be fired from the U.S. and reach anywhere in the world within an hour, providing an effective option for attacks worldwide, such as against a missile launch from North Korea or a strike against Al-Qaeda in Pakistan.
SNT.159837.14976	The new weapons would achieve the same effects as nuclear weapons, without the threat of conventional war escalating into nuclear war.
SNT.159837.14977	The changes reflect a new focus on nonproliferation and arms control by the Obama administration, policies that were largely dismissed by the Bush administration.
SNT.159837.14978	In conjunction with new domestic policies, the Obama administration is trying to win passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would ban all nuclear explosions for any purposes.
SNT.159837.14979	The treaty was defeated in the 1990s, during the Clinton presidency, and still faces strong resistance in the U.S. Senate.
SNT.159837.14980	The Obama administration is also trying to revise the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to close loopholes that have been exploited by North Korea and Iran.
SNT.159837.14981	The administration has also been pressured to redefine the role of America's nuclear arsenal.
SNT.159837.14982	Democrats have been pressuring the administration to formally declare that the role of America's nuclear weapons is solely to deter nuclear attack on the United States.
SNT.159837.14983	American military officials, as well as some officials within the White House, however, have urged the administration to retain more ambiguous wording from the Bush era, which says that nuclear deterrence is only the primary role of American nuclear weapons, which would leave open the option of using nuclear weapons against enemies that threaten the US with chemical or biological weapons.
SNT.249043.14984	Tera Myers, a former actress in pornographic films, has left her position as a science teacher at Parkway North High School in St. Louis County, Missouri after her past was revealed by a student.
SNT.249043.14985	This marks the second such controversy involving Myers, also known under the names Tericka Dye and the stage name Rikki Anderson.
SNT.249043.14986	She was suspended by Kentucky's McCracken County Public Schools system in 2006 after her career in pornography was made public.
SNT.249043.14987	Don Senti, interim superintendent of the district, said Myers was on administrative leave from her position at the school at her own request.
SNT.249043.14988	Myers' request, granted "out of respect for her privacy and that of her family," came after a student inquired about her pornographic career.
SNT.249043.14989	The district said Myers passed background checks before being hired as a teacher in 2007, but it did not know about her past until the student found out about it online, because her career in the pornography industry was legal.
SNT.249043.14990	A Parkway representative said the Kentucky school at which Myers last worked was contacted in 2007 to verify her references, but no mention of her suspension or stint in pornography was provided.
SNT.249043.14991	Myers will continue to be paid until the end of the semester, at which time she is to leave the Parkway School District.
SNT.249043.14992	According to Tandy, Dye "was concerned about the impact it would have in the building," and, on March 4, informed the school's principal of her past after being asked by the student.
SNT.249043.14993	Myers also was the coach of the girls' volleyball at Parkway North High School.
SNT.249043.14994	Myers previously taught at Reidland High School in Paducah, Kentucky, and was suspended in 2006 after a student there discovered her pornographic career.
SNT.249043.14995	That May, Myers defended herself, saying, "Anybody who has been in my classroom could tell you how much I love teaching and how much I love these students, and that should be what matters more than anything in my past."
SNT.249043.14996	Known as Tericka Dye at the time, she protested against her dismissal and even appeared on the "Dr. Phil" talk show.
SNT.249043.14997	Myers said she became involved in the adult industry after working as an impoverished exotic dancer in California.
SNT.254692.14998	Late last month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed objections to the United States Government's 'secret' attempts to obtain Twitter account information relating to WikiLeaks.
SNT.254692.14999	The ACLU and EFF cite First and Fourth amendment issues as overriding reasons to overturn government attempts to keep their investigation secret; and, that with Birgitta Jonsdottir being an Icelandic Parliamentarian, the issue has serious international implications.
SNT.254692.15000	The case, titled "In the Matter of the 2703(d) Order Relating to Twitter Accounts: Wikileaks, Rop_G, IOERROR; and BirgittaJ", has been in the EFF's sights since late last year when they became aware of the US government's attempts to investigate WikiLeaks-related communications using the popular microblogging service.
SNT.28384.15001	That was said by some, especially from nationalistic and populist parties, such as Peace and Justice, and Self-Defense and League of Polish Families, candidates in the last elections (both parliamentary and presidential), who had been promising people a strengthening of the position of Polish president.
SNT.28384.15002	He was unable to stand for re-election again as the Constitution of Poland states that the Polish president can only be re-elected once.
SNT.58686.15003	The head of the Israel Defense Forces, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, resigned on Tuesday January 16, 2007 after an internal review criticized his military's leadership during the war in Lebanon last summer.
SNT.58686.15004	Halutz sent his resignation letter to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, which according to Israeli Army Radio said, "For me, the concept of responsibility is everything."
SNT.58686.15005	Halutz has also been facing criticism after it was disclosed that he sold a portion of his stock portfolio hours after the Lebanon fighting began on July 12, 2006.
SNT.22051.15006	The slow moving, and wavering between hurricane status and tropical storm Ophelia, crawled up the U.S. coastline from northern Florida on what appears to be a track for landfall on Thursday near Cape Lookout, North Carolina on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
SNT.22051.15007	Ophelia gained some strength to a Category 1 hurricane over the last 24 hours while on its north-northeast track to side-swipe the protruding coastline of the Carolinas.
SNT.22051.15008	Power outages were reported with sustained winds of 80 mph and rain, up to 6 inches, in the southeast portion of the state.
SNT.22051.15009	Ocean Isle Beach closed a bridge to the barrier islands due to the rough surf conditions created by Ophelia.
SNT.22051.15010	Residents and tourists had been ordered on Sunday to evacuate Ocracoke by governor Michael F. Easley.
SNT.22051.15011	Tourists on Hatteras Island were also ordered to leave, but earlier on Monday, emergency officials for Dare County decided against an ordered evacuation for the northern portion of the Outer Banks.
SNT.22051.15012	Weaker tropical and hurricane storms such as Ophelia have in the past still caused major damage from flooding in North Carolina's barrier islands from winds stirring up the shallow sound waters between the mainlaind and Outer Banks.
SNT.22051.15013	Further inland from the storm, except for the possibility of thunderstorms, little effect from Ophelia is expected.
SNT.22051.15014	Virginia's governor Mark R. Warner declared a state of emergency on Monday as a precaution.
SNT.22051.15015	Nearly two dozen F-15 fighter jets were moved from Hampton's Langley Air Force base out of Ophelia's way to Florida.
SNT.121110.15016	A team of scientists at Stanford University claim to have detected a subtle, missing element of Einstein's theory of relativity.
SNT.121110.15017	In a press release dated February 16th, Robert Kahn, Stanford University's Public Affairs Coordinator, announced the experimental confirmation of frame dragging, an effect in which the presence of a rotating body causes space itself to be pulled along as the body rotates.
SNT.121110.15018	While the effect was theorized by Josef Lense and Hans Thirring as far back as 1918, the small scale of the effect, as little as one part in a trillion for a satellite orbiting the Earth, made detecting the effect difficult.
SNT.121110.15019	The observation was made by the Gravity Probe B satellite, which carries finely-machined gyroscopes.
SNT.121110.15020	Scientists looked for small changes in the motion of the gyroscopes to detect the frame dragging effect, as well as the much larger geodetic effect – small corrections to the Earth's gravitational field due to differences between Einstein's and Newton's theories of gravity.
SNT.121110.15021	The experiment was conducted on the satellite from 2004 to 2005.
SNT.121110.15022	However, the complexity of the data analysis along with unforeseen engineering problems have made finding the effect in the experiment's results difficult.
SNT.121110.15023	In particular, the presence of small electrical charges on the gyroscopes interfered with their results.
SNT.121110.15024	Francis Everitt, the experiment's Principal Investigator, stresses in an interview with the New York Times that their announcement is only preliminary and that, with further analysis, they hope to improve the precision of their results; currently, they say they have only detected the frame dragging effect to within plus or minus fifteen percent of its expected value.
SNT.121110.15025	The theory of general relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century to explain the behavior of moving objects in space, after the discovery that the speed of light was always the same no matter how the person measuring it was moving.
SNT.121110.15026	While it successfully explains many strange behaviors in space, such as the slow shifting of the orbit of Mercury and the bending of light by massive objects such as black holes, testing the theory on Earth has always been difficult due to the small scale of relativity's effects in everyday life.
SNT.112703.15027	The 'Invitational Games for the Deaf, Taipei 2008' started yesterday in Taipei, Taiwan.
SNT.112703.15028	After table tennis and soccer, events from martial arts including karate, judo, and taekwondo were featured mainly in the 2nd matchday.
SNT.112703.15029	Unlike the taekwondo event which applied a single elimination rule, events from karate and judo applied round robin rules in their competitions.
SNT.125464.15030	A University of Georgia marketing professor has allegedly killed three people and injured two others today in the southeastern United States.
SNT.125464.15031	The shooting took place approximately 12:25 p.m around the Athens Community Theater in the Athens-Clarke County, in the northeast part of Georgia.
SNT.125464.15032	Authorities suspect George Zinkhan in the shooting and have issued a nationwide alert for him and his 2005 red Jeep Liberty with Georgia license plate AIX1376.
SNT.125464.15033	The Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) reports that two handguns were found at the scene.
SNT.125464.15034	Athens-Clarke County Police Captain Clarence Holeman reported that two others were injured by shrapnel, and the extent of their injuries is unknown.
SNT.125464.15035	A discussion took place before an evening performance between the alleged shooter and one of the victims.
SNT.125464.15036	The AJC reports that the victims were Marie Bruce, 47, Ben Teague, 63, and Tom Tanner, 40.
SNT.125464.15037	Clarke County coroner Sonny Wilson said Saturday night that all three were shot multiple times.
SNT.125464.15038	Bruce was the wife of the alleged shooter and president of the theater company, while the others were part of a production of Sherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure.
SNT.125464.15039	Tanner was performing in the production, and Teague was a member of the production crew.
SNT.125464.15040	Police also report that Zinkhan was involved in an argument with an unidentified man before the shooting occurred.
SNT.125464.15041	According to Capt. Clarence Holeman of the Athens-Clarke County Police Dept., the two people wounded suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to St. Mary's Hospital in Athens.
SNT.125464.15042	Holeman also confirmed that both victims were injured by ricochet: one in the leg and one in the foot.
SNT.125464.15043	Zinkhan is reported to have left his two youngest children in the car while at theater, and then left to drop them off at the home of his his neighbor Robert Covington.
SNT.125464.15044	Zinkhan reportedly told Covington that there had been an emergency and would be gone for about an hour.
SNT.125464.15045	"Our first thoughts are for safety of the university community and for prompt apprehension of the person responsible."
SNT.125464.15046	"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who have been affected," University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams said in an official statement.
SNT.125464.15047	Matt Hardy, 22 years old, was at the scene of the crime, and had seen his friend Tom Tanner being shot twice.
SNT.125464.15048	His father John Hardy commented to reporters that "at 22 you're not supposed to watch people die."
SNT.125464.15049	Matt Hardy spoke to investigators and departed with his parents.
SNT.125464.15050	The university sent text messages and e-mails to students advising them of the potentially dangerous situation.
SNT.125464.15051	Police are requesting that anyone who comes in contact with the suspect dial 911 and exercise extreme caution.
SNT.125464.15052	Zinkhan has been described as a 57-year-old Caucasian with a goatee-style beard and full mustache.
SNT.125464.15053	He has blue eyes and brown hair worn above the ear according to his most recent photograph.
SNT.125464.15054	He was reported to have been wearing blue shorts with a polo shirt at the time of the shooting, and he may be driving the red Jeep.
SNT.104553.15055	The BBC has reported that 8000 schools have been fully or partially closed by today’s national UK teachers strike.
SNT.104553.15056	The majority of state schools in the city of Bristol are closing for the strike, although many of the schools for students age 16+ are expected to remain open.
SNT.104553.15057	Some schools that originally said they would be closed have made the decision not to close for the strike.
SNT.104553.15058	The Guardian reports that the strike, which is expected to take place on Thursday, will be the first national teachers' strike in 21 years.
SNT.104553.15059	Earlier this week, John Dunford from the Association of School and College Leaders told The Guardian that: "Most secondary schools will be partially closed; a thousand could close."
SNT.2756.15060	Republicans and lobbyists close to President George W. Bush have reported that the White House will propose changing the formula for establishing initial Social Security benefit levels in order to cut guaranteed expenditures on future retirees, according to today's Washington Post.
SNT.2756.15061	The Social Security Administration would no longer use the increase in wages over a worker’s lifetime to calculate retirees’ first-year benefits but would use inflation rates instead.
SNT.2756.15062	The new “price indexing” formula will reduce individual benefits and overall Social Security outlays because the inflation rate typically is much lower than the rise in wages.
SNT.2756.15063	The full impact of the change will be felt in the middle of the century.
SNT.2756.15064	The Bush Administration proposal, which will be offered to Congress in February or March 2005, is part of an overall Social Security reform package that also would create “personal investment accounts” into which individual taxpayers could divert part of their payroll taxes.
SNT.2756.15065	The White House believes that the shortfall in benefits created by the adoption of price indexing would be made up by capital gains from the stocks and bonds held by individual taxpayers in their personal investment accounts.
SNT.2756.15066	The move is akin to the private sector's migration from defined benefit retirement plans to defined contribution benefit plans such as 401(k)s as almost half of a worker’s benefits will not be guaranteed by the year 2075.
SNT.2756.15067	President Bush will support the move to price indexing for calculating initial benefits by pointing out that it was the approach recommended by his 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security.
SNT.2756.15068	Benefits currently are calculated by averaging a worker’s earnings in their 35 highest-paid years and adjusting earnings to factor in cost of living standards at the worker’s retirement age.
SNT.2756.15069	Under the Bush proposal, rather than adjusting benefits on the basis of earnings growth, the calculation would be based on the increase in the consumer price index over those years.
SNT.2756.15070	The implementation of "price indexing" would cut future Social Security costs by trillions of dollars.
SNT.2756.15071	However, the cuts in guaranteed benefits for middle-class and some high-income workers would be substantial: 9.9% for workers retiring in 2022, over 25% for workers retiring in 2042, and 46% for workers retiring in 2075.
SNT.2756.15072	Opponents of the price-indexing proposal point out that inflation-based calculations of benefits, by linking benefits to prices but not wage levels, would cut retirees out from future increases in living standards since it is wages and not prices that determine standards of living.
SNT.2756.15073	While American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Policy Director John Rother concedes that many of the arguments of opponents are valid, price indexing is inevitable and must be viewed in the context of President Bush’s total reform package.
SNT.2756.15074	Rother points out that Social Security benefits, which currently equal 42 percent of the earnings of an average worker retiring at age 65, would be reduced to 20% of pre-retirement earnings for future retirees, thus potentially freezing retirees into today’s standard of living.
SNT.2756.15075	However, Rother says that price indexing has to be linked to Bush’s private investment accounts as income from the accounts give retirees the chance to make up the shortfalls.
SNT.9259.15076	International Labor Day, or May Day, has been marked by protests throughout Switzerland.
SNT.9259.15077	Roughly 12,000 protesters organized across the country, rallying against the dismantling of social welfare, as well as wage dumping and the large salaries of top company officials.
SNT.9259.15078	The protests were peaceful, although minor skirmishes did occur in Zurich and Lucerne.
SNT.9259.15079	These usually involved clashes between left and right extremists rather than with authorities.
SNT.9259.15080	In one case, bottles and fireworks were used as weapons, but no injuries were reported.
SNT.9259.15081	Protesters in Geneva demand reform regarding illegal immigration, and equality for men and women.
SNT.9259.15082	In Zurich trade unions urged the free movement of people, as well as an ending to the pressure on salaries.
SNT.9259.15083	Vasco Pedrina, Co-president of the union Unia, called the difference between high and low incomes a "existential and human tragedy".
SNT.9259.15084	Pedrina and others, including Bern mayor Alexander Tschäppät, spoke out during the Saturday and Sunday period of protests.
SNT.275116.15085	A recently published nationwide survey of US teenagers indicates boys tend to masturbate more — and start younger — than girls.
SNT.275116.15086	It also finds boys who masturbate are more likely to engage in safe sex than boys who don't.
SNT.275116.15087	Dr. Cynthia L. Robbins, the study's lead author from Indiana University in Indianapolis, spoke of the need for the academic community to focus more on masturbation.
SNT.275116.15088	"Many adolescent boys and girls masturbate, and among sexually active teens masturbation is associated with other sexual behaviors and condom use."
SNT.275116.15089	"It is important to recognize that masturbation is an important and normal component of adolescent sexual development."
SNT.275116.15090	The survey, named the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB), was supported by Church & Dwight, which makes Trojan condoms.
SNT.275116.15091	A representative nationwide sample of 820 teens 14–17 years old participated in the study with parental permission.
SNT.275116.15092	The findings were published Monday in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
SNT.275116.15093	Male and female respondents were asked to note how frequently they masturbated in the past three months, the past year, and throughout their lifetime.
SNT.275116.15094	They were also asked to recall whether they masturbated alone or with a partner, and also how often they used condoms.
SNT.275116.15095	Nearly three-fourths of boys reported having masturbated, compared to only less than half of girls.
SNT.275116.15096	About half of boys reported masturbating twice or more per week, also higher than the 23 percent of girls.
SNT.275116.15097	Masturbation rates for both genders increased along with age, though only boys were more likely to report having "recently" engaged in the activity as they grew older.
SNT.275116.15098	Among adolescents who engage in oral or vaginal sex, boys who masturbate were eight times more likely to use a condom than boys who don't.
SNT.275116.15099	The researchers who conducted the study urge more open and educational discussion of this highly stigmatized topic.
SNT.275116.15100	"The findings of this study together with existing publications on masturbation should be used by health care providers to inform, educate and reassure adolescents about masturbation to provide competent and comprehensive sexuality education in the clinical setting".
SNT.10698.15101	May 27, 2005 Mount Qomolangma, known in the west as Mount Everest, may be taller than ever, and a group of 24 Chinese researchers have scaled the peak and made observations they hope will document its current height.
SNT.10698.15102	In 1975 the peak was surveyed at a height of 8 848 metres, in line with previous calculations, but a U.S. survey team in 1999 measured it at 8 850m.
SNT.10698.15103	The growth to some extent fits current theories regarding the geology of the region, a region with crustal upthrust.
SNT.10698.15104	The growth may also be due in part to rapid glacier retreat on the peak's slopes, and the mountain springing back as the weight of snow melts and runs off.
SNT.10698.15105	At the same time, recent theories suggest the mountain is also shrinking.
SNT.10698.15106	The peak may be getting smaller from subsidence as it reaches extreme heights, and again the glaciers and snow help to stabilize and expand the mountain itself.
SNT.10698.15107	There is some disagreement regarding the methods of measurement used previously, so the researchers spent an hour at the summit taking measurements using radar, satellite, and other methods on 6 points.
SNT.10698.15108	The average of the measurements will be used to make the official Chinese measurement, which remains at 8 848.
SNT.10698.15109	Results of the expedition are expected to be available in August.
SNT.10698.15110	A previous measurement team from Italy also used the radar methodology in 2004, but their results have not yet been published.
SNT.10698.15111	The mountain straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal, and is known by several names.
SNT.10698.15112	In Chinese, 珠穆朗瑪峰 (pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng); Tibetan Qomolangma ("Mother of the Universe"); in Nepal Sagarmatha ("Forehead of the Sky"); and in English named after Sir George Everest.
SNT.54350.15113	In a conscience vote last night, Wednesday, parliament decided that the alcohol purchasing for New Zealanders will not be raised to 20 but instead will stay at the current age of 18.
SNT.54350.15114	The vote was 72-49 with the noes as the majority, a conscience vote is where the individual Member of Parliament (MP) votes instead of the party and their policies.
SNT.54350.15115	The bill was brought before Parliament with the intent of placing the drinking age back at 20 following its lowering to 18 in 1999.
SNT.54350.15116	It was first drafted by Matt Robson of the NZ Progressive Party, and was then taken on by Martin Gallagher from the New Zealand Labour Party.
SNT.54350.15117	However, the Labour-led government is being attacked for interfering with the liquor purchase age bill.
SNT.54350.15118	Before the debate on the bill, two ministers who are against raising the age, justice minister Mark Burton and associate health minister, Damien O'Conner both announced that they would fully review the sale/supply of liquor to people below the age of 18, regardless of whether the bill were passed or not.
SNT.54350.15119	The review will most likely look at how many off-licence outlets there are and increased law enforcement of the drink age.
SNT.54350.15120	Mr Burton said that he did not pre-empt the bill voting, he said: "It was important to ensure all options were on the table before the vote."
SNT.54350.15121	"What we are saying is you can have confidence that if the bill doesn't proceed there will be an alternative vehicle for addressing the issues immediately thereafter."
SNT.54350.15122	Many MPs said that it was unorthodox to intrude in such a manner in the voting process.
SNT.54350.15123	Leader of Jim Anderton's Progressive coalition and supporter of the bill, Jim Anderton, said: "Making a last-minute plea to MPs is not to be fooled by the promise of the unnecessary review."
SNT.54350.15124	"This is the review you have when you want to give parliamentarians a soft option."
SNT.54350.15125	"And I hear that sigh of relief in many places, 'oh gosh you've got a review so we don't have to make a hard decision'."
SNT.54350.15126	"Well this is the place for hard decisions and this is where the buck stops."
SNT.54350.15127	Christopher Bishop, a spokesman for the Keep it 18 campaign, said: "We welcome the Government's moves to review the supply of alcohol to minors in the likely event that the Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill is defeated today."
SNT.54350.15128	"Raising the drinking age is never going to work as a way of dealing with New Zealand's drinking culture."
SNT.54350.15129	"It is a simplistic and knee-jerk solution – a legislative sledgehammer."
SNT.54350.15130	Chester Burrows, National MP, said: "My experience is I've seen too many pissed young people, raped young people, assaulted young people."
SNT.54350.15131	Gordon Copeland, United Future MP, who also preferred the split age, said he had "no doubt the move would influence the way people voted."
SNT.54350.15132	Ron Mark, New Zealand First MP, said: "Are we going to do something, or are we going to do nothing?" asked New Zealand First list MP Ron Mark.
SNT.54350.15133	"We can at least let this bill go through to the next stage."
SNT.54350.15134	Ross Bell, spokesman for the Drug Foundation, said: "Not only is such a review too narrow, it also seemed to pre-empt the outcome of Wednesday's debate."
SNT.54350.15135	"A cynical person might think the announcement gave MPs an excuse not to support the bill."
SNT.54350.15136	"That review has already been looked at by the Law and Order Select Committee, and what is needed is a review of price and availability of alcohol."
SNT.54350.15137	However it has been suggested by the select committee previously researching the drinking problem in New Zealand that there is little hard evidence 18 & 19 year olds are buying alcohol for minors, with the largest problem instead being the purchasing of alcohol by parents for their children.
SNT.61887.15138	A rupture in the underground stormwater drain system opened a huge sinkhole on February 23, killing three people and bringing down twelve houses in Guatemala City.
SNT.61887.15139	Teenagers Irma and David Soyos and their father, 53-year old Domingo Soyos were killed when their house collapsed into the sinkhole.
SNT.61887.15140	Nearly a thousand people were evacuated from the San Antonio neighborhood after the collapse.
SNT.61887.15141	Wikinews interviewed Eric Haddox, a civil engineer who has visited the site of the sinkhole and spoken to the engineers working on fixing the drain.
SNT.61887.15142	Mr. Haddox, who specialises in the building of earthworks, roads, water supply and sewage systems, and is working as a missionary in Guatemala, visited the site following the collapse to help in the recovery effort.
SNT.61887.15143	Mr. Haddox told us that the size of the hole is much smaller than the 330 feet depth originally reported and that the erosion causing the collapse is believed to have happened over a long time, and not just during the recent rains as initially suspected.
SNT.61887.15144	There are also concerns that a four-story building less than a metre from the edge of the hole may collapse as the earth under the building continues to be eroded.
SNT.68018.15145	The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence from the UK, has pulled off a historic, albeit narrow, victory in yesterday's Scottish elections.
SNT.68018.15146	In the third Scottish election since the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the left of centre SNP beat the ruling Labour Party by a single seat.
SNT.68018.15147	It won 47 seats, while Labour won 46, down from the current 50.
SNT.68018.15148	It is the first time since the parliament opened that Labour has been beaten, and the first time in fifty years that they have not had a majority of Scottish constituency seats in any election.
SNT.68018.15149	SNP leader Alex Salmond declared: "Scotland has changed for good and forever."
SNT.68018.15150	He added that the Labour Party had "lost the moral authority to govern Scotland."
SNT.68018.15151	The current First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell of Labour said: "While I recognise that the SNP are the largest party by the narrowest of margins, Alex Salmond must himself recognise that he does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament or anywhere near a majority of the vote."
SNT.68018.15152	It is believed that many factors caused the Labour vote to slump and the SNP vote to rise, including the war in Iraq and the renewal of Trident, which are both unpopular in Scotland.
SNT.68018.15153	The election also raises a serious dilemma for the Labour party's Gordon Brown, a Scotsman widely tipped to succeed Tony Blair as the next prime minister of the United Kingdom.
SNT.68018.15154	Brown is vehement in his support of the Union, and is a Westminster (London parliament) MP for Kirkcaldy.
SNT.68018.15155	An SNP government in Scotland will find itself facing the very Labour party it beat in power in London.
SNT.122789.15156	Hifikepunye Pohamba, the president of the southern African country of Namibia, declared a state of emergency in in the country on Tuesday after heavy flooding killed 92 and displaced 5,032 since January.
SNT.122789.15157	100,000 children were unable to attend classes due to the disaster, which closed 218 schools.
SNT.122789.15158	Severe flooding occurred in Namibia about the same time last year, when 42 people were killed by the disaster.
SNT.122789.15159	This year's floods appear to be worse, as President Pohamba stated that the Zambezi River had reached 7.1 metres, compared to last year's peak of 5.37 metres.
SNT.122789.15160	Flooding has also reached neighbouring Angola, where nineteen people have died, according to the Red Cross.
SNT.82224.15161	Wednesday morning, the Frankfurt Book Fair opened its gates to the first of an estimated 280,000 visitors this year in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
SNT.82224.15162	The Frankfurt Book Fair is the biggest book fair in the world.
SNT.82224.15163	It also organises the participation of German publishers at more than 25 international book fairs and is the co-founder of the Cape Town Book Fair in South Africa.
SNT.82224.15164	It maintains the most visited website worldwide for the publishing industry.
SNT.82224.15165	The German Publishers & Booksellers Association, which runs the Frankfurt Book Fair, says that the book market is thriving.
SNT.82224.15166	It declared on Tuesday that the high number of exhibitors and the record numbers of 7,448 exhibitors from over 100 countries, showing 391,652 books, including 121,267 new books of this year, proves that the book market is thriving.
SNT.82224.15167	TV and merchandising rights have long played a role, but have become more and more important for larger projects.
SNT.82224.15168	Two other media forms have also become more standard elements of the value chain.
SNT.82224.15169	E-books and audiobooks are both big topics of this year's Book Fair.
SNT.37496.15170	Fighting words were exchanged in the Australian House of Representatives over the matter of the division of Medicare safety net payments per electorate.
SNT.37496.15171	The Minister for Health and Ageing Tony Abbott (Liberal, Warringah) had introduced a policy that the Government would pay Medicare users up to a fixed amount — the safety net — to help in addressing "gaps" in certain payments which Medicare would not cover, such as certain hospital payments.
SNT.37496.15172	The Opposition was opposed to the idea on efficacy counts.
SNT.37496.15173	Abbott was asked a Dorothy Dixer in Question Time today about the benefits of the safety net.
SNT.37496.15174	He alleged that criticism by the Opposition Health spokeswoman Julia Gillard (Labor, Lalor) that the safety net favoured Liberal/National Party coalition electorates was misleading as it was a Labor electorate, Grayndler that received the "highest safety net benefits per electorate".
SNT.37496.15175	This led Gillard to make a personal explanation after Question Time, stating that "the top four electorates receiving money under the Medicare safety net are Wentworth, North Sydney, Bradfield and Warringah" — all coalition electorates.
SNT.37496.15176	The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley (Labor, Brand), put a question to the Speaker of the House, David Hawker (Liberal, Wannon) asking of the Speaker his "assurance that no person is being deliberately misled by the actions of any other person".
SNT.37496.15177	Abbott had then interjected towards Beazley, saying "You big bellowing cow"; the Speaker asked Abbott to withdraw, but Abbott mentioned that "the Leader of the Opposition regularly interjects 'pompous ass' and 'goose', but I am happy to withdraw".
SNT.37496.15178	Beazley then responded through the Speaker saying of Abbott, "I think that he is a sleazy, dummy-spitting, little git."
SNT.37496.15179	Abbott then made a personal explanation of his own, saying "The safety net benefit per person in the electorate of the member for Grayndler was $591, the highest in New South Wales...the safety net benefit in the electorate of Sydney was $589, the second highest...the benefit in the electorate of Lowe was $458, the third highest".
SNT.37496.15180	The matter was not further raised at the time, but after the Matter of Public Importance debate, Gillard moved a motion to suspend standing orders which would prevent Abbott from explaining his earlier claim "when this claim is totally untrue", to correct the "grossly inaccurate and misleading statement", to "apologise to all Members in this place" and to "apologize to the Member for Grayndler and his constituents".
SNT.37496.15181	Gillard also listed the amounts of payments "released by the Minister himself", that Wentworth received $7.8 million, North Sydney received $7.5 million, Bradfield received $6.9 million, Warringah received $6.3 million; whereas Grayndler received only $3.6 million.
SNT.37496.15182	She attempted to debate the motion but a gag motion to silence Gillard was moved and won because of Government numbers.
SNT.37496.15183	Anthony Albanese, the Labor member for Grayndler attempted to second the motion but the gag was moved on him as well.
SNT.37496.15184	The final vote on the motion was lost 55 to 79.
SNT.452286.15185	In the gold medal match at water polo's FINA World League Final tonight between the Australia Stingers and United States women's national water polo team, Australia lost 4–6 to the USA in the last major competition before the 2012 Summer Olympics.
SNT.452286.15186	The victory made for seven World League Super Final titles for Team USA.
SNT.452286.15187	At 7:00 p.m. Chinese local time, 9:00 p.m. Australian local time, the game got under way, with a Tweet from Australian Water Polo for fans at home who could not watch the game live.
SNT.452286.15188	The Australians were down at quarter time, 1–2 with the team's only goal coming from Bronwen Knox off a pass by Kate Gynther.
SNT.452286.15189	By half time, Australia had battled back to take the lead 4–3, only to finish the third period tied 4–4 with the United States, and eventually lose 4–6.
SNT.452286.15190	In the lead up to the World League Final, the Australians spent time in Singapore before departing for China.
SNT.452286.15191	While in Singapore, players had an opportunity to relax at the pool and several, including Knox, Rowena Webster, Nicola Zagame, and Melissa Rippon were very active on Twitter.
SNT.452286.15192	The team arrived in Shanghai and the Shanghai Institute of Sport a week before the start of the FINA Super League Finals.
SNT.452286.15193	During their week-long preparation, they worked on strength and fitness training.
SNT.452286.15194	When away from the pool, they did not have access to Twitter, Facebook, or television and had to entertain themselves using other means.
SNT.452286.15195	Players finally explored the city six days after their arrival.
SNT.452286.15196	With limited opportunities for amusement in the hotel room during the competition, assistant coach Ryan Moar updated his Twitter account and played with a toy helicopter.
SNT.452286.15197	Several of the players who were active on Twitter before departing for China stopped updating, including Webster, Rippon, and Zagame.
SNT.452286.15198	Knox and Moran continued to provide updates on Twitter and Instagram throughout the competition.
SNT.452286.15199	Australian game days during the tournament included warming up poolside before the start of their games, and cooling down in the pool after them.
SNT.452286.15200	Going into their match against the USA, they notched an 8–7 victory over China, an 18 to nil victory against Germany, and a 9–7 overtime shootout win against Russia.
SNT.452286.15201	On gold medal game day, Jane Moran updated her Twitter account to say "Final of World League Super Finals today v USA - goooo Stingers! ‪#stingerspride".
SNT.452286.15202	About eight hours prior to game time, the team finished their final training session.
SNT.452286.15203	Earlier in the afternoon, prior to game time in Australia, Channel 9 ran a feature on the team.
SNT.452286.15204	Prior to the start of the game, the Australian Stingers official team Twitter account mocked Team USA for their team-branded k tape.
SNT.452286.15205	During the pre-game warm up, team members did a variety of things including playing with their phones, warming up, and getting their arms taped.
SNT.452286.15206	It was business as usual for the team that had beaten the United States the previous month at the VISA Water Polo International.
SNT.452286.15207	The bronze medal match between the China women's national water polo team and Greece women's national water polo team preceded the gold medal game, which Greece won 8–7, with quarter scoring of 1–2 in the first, 4–2 in the second, 1–2 in the third, and 1–2 in the fourth.
SNT.452286.15208	In the other match, the Russia women's national water polo team easily beat the Germany women's national water polo team 18-4.
SNT.17046.15209	NASA has said that preliminary investigations show that Discovery is safe to fly home.
SNT.17046.15210	Final findings will not be available for several days as a team of 200 experts study all video and stills footage taken of the shuttle during launch, and on approach to the International Space Station (ISS), with which Discovery docked earlier today.
SNT.17046.15211	Images from new cameras have revealed that a section of foam weighing some 250 g fell away from the external fuel tank during launch, but did not strike the Orbiter.
SNT.17046.15212	However, NASA has announced the grounding of all further planned Shuttle launches until they have a firm understanding of why the foam comes away, and what to do about it.
SNT.17046.15213	A piece of foam striking the Columbia's wing during take-off in January 2003 was responsible for the loss of the craft as it made its reentry to Earth's atmosphere.
SNT.17046.15214	As part of the check for damage the crew of Discovery used a laser-scanner on the robotic arm to inspect the craft's wing leading-edges and nosecone.
SNT.17046.15215	The belly of the Orbiter will be checked later this week.
SNT.17046.15216	In a first, the Shuttle also performed a slow back-flip in some 180 m from the ISS enabling the two-man crew of the space station to take high-resolution images of the underside of the Orbiter.
SNT.105071.15217	Chelsea beat Liverpool in extra time to advance to next month's UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow.
SNT.105071.15218	Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina punched away Michael Ballack's shot which landed at the feet of Didier Drogba who capitalized by scoring the opening goal of the 2nd leg.
SNT.105071.15219	Fernando Torres equalized in the 2nd half after Yossi Benayoun beat the defenders to set up the goal.
SNT.105071.15220	After Chelsea were denied a goal by the Assistant Referee moments earlier, Referee awarded Chelsea a penalty shot which Frank Lampard converted.
SNT.105071.15221	Dider Drogba added Chelsea's 3rd goal of the 2nd leg.
SNT.105071.15222	Ryan Babbel brought Liverpool within a goal of advancing with 3 minutes of extra time remaining.
SNT.105071.15223	The win for Chelsea means that they have made their 1st ever UEFA Champions League final and will be competing in the 1st ever all-English final in UEFA Champions League history.
SNT.10431.15224	In an effort to ease complaints by the U.S. and Europe about a heavy influx of low priced Chinese goods, China will raise export tariffs on 74 categories of textile products in June.
SNT.10431.15225	This follows plans from the U.S. to impose quotas on Chinese textiles and clothing.
SNT.10431.15226	Products likely to see an increase from the Chinese move include synthetic fiber shirts, trousers, knit shirts and blouses, cotton shirts, and combined cotton yarn.
SNT.10431.15227	Last week, similar restrictions were imposed by the U.S. on cotton trousers, knit shirts, and underwear.
SNT.10431.15228	Currently, a 2.5 cent charge per item is imposed; the new tariff will raise this to the equivalent of 12 cents per piece now.
SNT.10431.15229	While this is a fourfold increase, it is not expected to affect consumer prices.
SNT.10431.15230	Because of this, some doubt the tariff will have any effect on correcting the trade imbalance.
SNT.10431.15231	This move is in response to U.S. trade quotas imposed due to concerns that increased Chinese goods would put U.S. textile manufacturers out of business.
SNT.10431.15232	According to Auggie Tantillo, executive director of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, a textile industry group in the U.S., the move will preserve 10,000 U.S. jobs.
SNT.10431.15233	The new U.S. trade quota will limit the growth of Chinese textile imports to 7.5 percent compared with shipments over the past year.
SNT.10431.15234	Prior to January 1, a global quota system helped regulate the trade.
SNT.10431.15235	With the quota system gone, fears have arisen that a flood of Chinese goods could undercut U.S. competitiveness in the market.
SNT.10431.15236	China is able to market its goods cheaply due to an artificially weak yuan.
SNT.10431.15237	The U.S. Treasury criticized the China yuan policy as "highly distortionary", posing a major risk to China's economy itself and to global economic growth.
SNT.10431.15238	They challenged China to revalue its currency to bring it to a level they believe will allow fairer competition between global manufacturers.
SNT.10431.15239	Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said, "I believe they are not reasonable".
SNT.10431.15240	Laura Jones, a representative of large retailers, also criticized the move, saying "These restrictions on imports from China will do absolutely nothing to help the U.S. textile industry -- and the government knows it."

SNT.144128.15271	The program began last Thursday and will continue until the end of the year.
SNT.144128.15272	There were 1,043 road fatalities in Illinois last year, and this year officials want that figure to be at 943 or less.
SNT.144128.15273	If successful, the state will have experienced the fewest road fatalities since 1921.
SNT.144128.15274	Organizations and advocacy groups throughout the state are encouraging citizens to promote public awareness of unsafe driving practices, such as driving while impaired, distracted, or unbelted.

SNT.144128.15277	More than 400 law enforcement agencies throughout the state are being asked to enhance operations and provide weekly activity and crash reports.
SNT.144128.15278	The Itasca Police Department, for example, has joined the initiative and will target DUI and seat belt violations, and the Ottawa Police Department will increase enforcement of driving laws by issuing citations to violators.
SNT.54816.15279	Columbia University President Lee Bollinger Wednesday jokingly named Bill Clinton to a professorship.
SNT.54816.15280	In opening remarks at the Kraft Program Series, "Challenges of New Democracies," he said that "the last time he was here I said that 'one more lecture,' and he'd be up for tenure."
SNT.54816.15281	Mr. Clinton and former Czech President Václav Havel were guest lecturers at the Morningside Heights campus.
SNT.54816.15282	Havel is midway through a seven week writing residency at Columbia.
SNT.54816.15283	Both nations former leaders spoke about the challenges they faced during their times in office in order to bring the former Warsaw Pact countries into the West.
SNT.54816.15284	Havel mentioned that no one anticipated the rise of criminal mafias in the post-communist period, and that he and other dissidents imaged a swift transition from communism to democracy.
SNT.54816.15285	He cited Czechoslovakia's 1948 destruction of civil society as a significant delay.
SNT.54816.15286	Clinton urged the United States to use its international economic power to improve the world.
SNT.54816.15287	Citing an even distribution of "intelligence and ability... throughout the world," with India and China's enormous population, he said that it's only a matter of time when "other people get their act together" and "have more people than we do" when, "as a nation, we won't be dominant."
SNT.54816.15288	Acknowledging increasing American reliance upon Chinese economic growth, Clinton said the Chinese government will shortly have "a trillion dollars in cash reserves" while the United States has "a combined annual budget and trade deficit of a trillion dollars."
SNT.54816.15289	Mentioning the Bush administration's tax cut given to him and others in his income tax class, he said that the United States "had to borrow money from (the Chinese government) to pay for my tax cut."
SNT.54816.15290	He also suggested that increasing American foreign aid to 0.7% of the U.S.'s $11 trillion Gross Domestic Product aid through cuts in the Department of Defense budget would "create a world with more partners and fewer adversaries."
SNT.54816.15291	Criticizing a "dubious construction of a very vaguely identified threat of WMDs in Iraq," Mr. Havel questioned why planners failed to anticipate civil instability after initial combat operations.
SNT.54816.15292	Mr. Clinton declined comment citing his recent testimony before the Baker-Hamilton Commission and his wife Hillary's position as New York senator.
SNT.54816.15293	He acknowledged that it is an international best interest policy if Iraq "held together rather than falling apart, we would be better off if it had some measure of security and couldn't become a base for terrorist operations."

SNT.659423.15296	The decision of the Committee for Small Body Nomenclature to assign the name "Wikipedia" to the asteroid was published in the Minor Planet Circular of January 27, published online yesterday, page 82403.
SNT.659423.15297	It was submitted to the Committee by the head of the Andrushivka Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine, Yuri Ivashchenko.
SNT.659423.15298	The asteroid 274301 Wikipedia was discovered by the team of astronomers of Andrushivka Astronomical Observatory.
SNT.659423.15299	At first it was observed by that team on August 25, 2008 at 22:47 (UTC).
SNT.659423.15300	It was also observed on the next night and two weeks later on September 6.
SNT.659423.15301	Accurate calculation of its orbit showed asteroid 2008 QH24 is the same as 1997 RO4 and 2007 FK34.
SNT.659423.15302	The asteroid had been previously spotted by observatories including Caussols-ODAS in France, and Mt. Lemmon Survey and Steward Observatory in Arizona, US.
SNT.659423.15303	On April 18, 2011 the minor planet received the number 274301.
SNT.38567.15304	Mohsin Musa Matawalli Atwah, 45, who is accused of being an Al-Qaeda explosive expert, was killed in a missile attack on Wednesday night in Pakistan, said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's information minister.
SNT.38567.15305	At least eight other alleged terrorists, both foreign and of Pakistani descent, were also believed to have been killed in the strike.
SNT.38567.15306	However, the body of Atwah has not yet been found and the identities of the others killed are not yet known.
SNT.38567.15307	It is believed that at least two children were also killed.
SNT.38567.15308	"We can confirm the identities of the foreigners killed once we have carried out a thorough ground check," said Pakistani military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan.
SNT.38567.15309	Atwah, also known as Abdul Rahman Al-Muhajir, Muhammad K.A. and Abdel Rahman, is accused of being responsible for the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998 which killed 20 Americans and at least 200 Africans.
SNT.38567.15310	Atwah is on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists with a bounty of five million dollars.
SNT.38567.15311	"The confirmation is based upon multiple intelligence sources," said Ahmed.
SNT.38567.15312	"I confirm the death of this Egyptian terrorist," said an Egyptian minister.
SNT.38567.15313	Pakistani forces used missile fire and explosives launched from assault helicopters to kill the expert in the North Waziristan village of Naghar Kalai, which lies near the border of Afghanistan.
SNT.38567.15314	Atwah "had been living here for quite some time," said one security official.
SNT.38567.15315	However, it is believed that associates of the alleged terrorists killed removed the bodies and buried them in an unidentified location, but at least four tribesmen that were killed were buried in the town's cemetery.
SNT.38567.15316	So far, neither the United States FBI nor U.S. officials in Egypt have confirmed the death of Atwah.

SNT.143327.15319	Scientists at the Ohio University predicted that the ice sheets of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's tallest mountain peak, will melt in the next twenty years due to global warming.
SNT.143327.15320	The ice that was present in 1912 gradually decreased by 85% by 2000, and by 2007 another 26% of the amount in 2000.
SNT.143327.15321	This was the first time that the volume of the ice in Kilimanjaro was measured.
SNT.143327.15322	The tests were conducted by Lonnie Thompson, a professor at Ohio University.
SNT.143327.15323	"The fact that so many glaciers throughout the tropics and subtropics are showing similar responses suggests an underlying common cause," Thompson said.
SNT.143327.15324	Change in cloudiness and weather could have also been factors in the retreat of the ice, especially in recent decades, scientists said.
SNT.143327.15325	These findings were first published in the journal proceedings of United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on Monday.
SNT.229604.15326	North Korea has warned of "self-defensive blows" to South Korea if they participate in joint, live-fire military exercises with the United States, scheduled to begin in the next few days.
SNT.229604.15327	The U.S. and South Korea will be taking part in a one day, live-fire exercise on Yeonpyeong Island, the island which was shelled by North Korean artillery on November 23.
SNT.229604.15328	Nearly 200 rounds of artillery were fired at the island.
SNT.229604.15329	Four people were killed and another 14 were injured in the attack.
SNT.229604.15330	South Korea had been taking part in annual military exercises with the U.S., off the island's west coast when the attack occurred.
SNT.229604.15331	They returned fire, firing nearly 80 rounds of artillery, but no damage was reported on the North Korean side.
SNT.229604.15332	"Second and third self-defensive blows that cannot be predicted will be dealt."
SNT.229604.15333	"The intensity and range of the firepower will create a situation more serious than one on Nov. 23," said a statement released by the North Korean government via the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the country's main news agency.
SNT.229604.15334	It accused the two nations of creating "hysteria of war of aggression against the DPRK, escalating the military tension and confrontation."
SNT.229604.15335	The nation's official website Uriminzokkiri, warns that "if war breaks out, it will lead to nuclear warfare and not be limited to the Korean Peninsula."
SNT.229604.15336	North Korea further demands the exercises be canceled saying, "the South Korean puppet warmongers must immediately cancel the provocative coastal live-fire drills planned on Yeonpyeong."
SNT.229604.15337	The country considers any exercises that take place on Yeonpyeong Island, to be a violation of their territory.
SNT.229604.15338	According to the U.S. State Department, the exercises are part of regular drills between the U.S. and South Korea and are not provocative.
SNT.229604.15339	"There’s nothing provocative or unusual or threatening about these exercises."
SNT.229604.15340	"The North Koreans have been notified about what South Korea plans to do," said Philip J. Crowley, a spokesman for the State Department.
SNT.229604.15341	The U.S. and South Korea have no plans to cancel the exercises.
SNT.10578.15342	A protester from the resident's association HACAN Clearskies today pushed a pie into the face of UK Transport Minister Alistair Darling.

SNT.10578.15345	Future Heathrow believe that Heathrow airport is crucial to prosperity of the Thames Valley region, and are in favour of building a third runway at the airport.
SNT.7648.15346	A Virginia, USA jury found a man, described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, guilty on Friday of the felony crime of using an alias to send massive bulk e-mailings.
SNT.7648.15347	The 9 year prison sentence handed down by the jury was put on hold by the Loudoun County Circuit Judge Thomas Horne, allowing the perpetrator, Jeremy Jaynes of Raleigh, N.C., to seek an appeal.
SNT.7648.15348	Jaynes, who used the alias “Gaven Stubberfield” as well as others, peddled junk products and pornography.
SNT.7648.15349	Prosecutors say he grossed up to $750,000 a month by sending at least 10 million emails a day using 16 high-speed lines.
SNT.7648.15350	The case was prosecuted in Virginia because it is the home to the leading internet service provider AOL, the company who instigated the charges.
SNT.7648.15351	This is the first time a conviction has been gained using the legislation enacted in 2003 to curb bulk e-mail, aka spam, from unsolicited distribution into users mailboxes.
SNT.7648.15352	Jaynes remains free on a $1 million bond while his case is appealed.
SNT.7648.15353	Prosecutors differed with his attorneys on the prospects of Jaynes winning his appeal.
SNT.7648.15354	His attorney, David Oblon, though never denying that his client was in the “marketing” business, argued that nine years was too long to sentence an out of state resident for a law that had taken effect just two weeks earlier.
SNT.7648.15355	"We have no doubt that we will win on appeal," Oblon told reporters.
SNT.7648.15356	"Still, the sentence is not what we recommended and we're disappointed."
SNT.7648.15357	Prosecuter Lisa Hicks-Thomas said she was pleased with the outcome and confident the law would be upheld on appeal.
SNT.50206.15358	Opera singer-turned-talk show host Charlotte Church wanted to book hotel heiress Paris Hilton on her program, to insult her.
SNT.50206.15359	Church says Hilton is too expensive though, charging USD$650,000 for an appearance, and her producers dropped the idea.
SNT.50206.15360	Church told a British radio show "We asked Paris to be on the program because I could take the mick out of her and not feel at all bad about it — she's such a complete airhead."
SNT.50206.15361	”But she demanded a ridiculous amount of money — like the price of a big house just to say a few stupid things.”
SNT.50206.15362	"She's hardly going to announce anything world-changing, is she?"
SNT.50206.15362-1	" It's absolutely pathetic, isn't it?"
SNT.50206.15363	The Charlotte Church Show has aired on Britain's Channel 4 since September 1, 2006.
SNT.80941.15364	Canada has a budget surplus of CA$13.8 billion for the 2006–2007 fiscal year, totaling 1% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP), Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced today.
SNT.80941.15365	The record surplus was boosted by revenue from government corporations to $14.2 billion, far exceeding the government's projections of $9.2 billion and surpassing the record set by the previous year's $13.2 billion surplus.
SNT.80941.15366	By federal law, all surplus must be used to pay down Canada's debt, and is not available for spending.
SNT.80941.15367	$90 billion in debt payments over the last ten years have reduced its debt to $467 billion or 32.3% of national GDP, its lowest level in a quarter century.
SNT.80941.15368	The announced debt payment is the largest in Canadian history.
SNT.80941.15369	The payment also reduced Canada's annual interest payments by $725 million, which the government pledged to pass on to taxpayers through tax returns and reduced income taxes.
SNT.80941.15370	The Conservative's "Tax Back Guarantee", proposed in the March budget, promises that money saved on interest payments will be deducted from Canadians' taxes.
SNT.80941.15371	The Globe and Mail predicts the tax returns will be 30–40 dollars per taxpayer.
SNT.80941.15372	Canada has posted ten consecutive budget surpluses in the last decade.
SNT.80941.15373	The Canadian economy, the 8th largest in the world, has benefited from rising global demand for its export commodities, particularly oil and copper, as well as record corporate profits.
SNT.80941.15374	This surplus was further increased by a $700 million drop from expected government spending.
SNT.80941.15375	Prime Minister Stephen Harper cautioned that the Canadian economy is still facing "tough times" in its forestry, manufacturing, and some export industries.
SNT.80941.15376	Critics point out that the Conservative government had said Canadians were overtaxed when they took office, and had vowed to eliminate "surplus surprises".
SNT.16801.15377	Charles Chibitty, the last surviving member of the group of 17 who served in World War II as the Comanche "code talkers" died in a Tulsa, Oklahoma nursing home July 20.
SNT.16801.15378	Chibitty was among the 14 Comanches who landed with the D-Day invasion of Normandy Beaches where they reported by radio to division headquarters on the progress of the landings.
SNT.16801.15379	The Comanche were dubbed code talkers because the American Indian language has no written record, and it was never broken by the Germans during the war.
SNT.16801.15380	One of the first messages transmitted in Comanche language during the landings was "right beach, wrong place".
SNT.16801.15381	It warned soldiers they landed about a half mile from their intended target.
SNT.16801.15382	Chibitty served with a unit that landed on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944.
SNT.16801.15383	Mr.Chibitty served with the rank of a Corporal in the 4th Infantry Division that engaged in the breakthrough of the Siegfried line in Hurtgen Forest.
SNT.16801.15384	His division also saw action in the Battle of the Bulge and the rescue of the "Lost Battalion".
SNT.16801.15385	His division was among the first to undertake the liberation of Paris.
SNT.16801.15386	Then later, the 4th Infantry was the first to enter Germany.
SNT.16801.15387	The Comanches, who came from the Lawton area in Oklahoma, heard rumors of a military plan to organize a native speaking unit.
SNT.16801.15388	He enlisted in 1941, and along with 19 others, they were trained for special duty by the U.S. Army Signal Corps.
SNT.16801.15389	All were sent to Fort Benning, but three remained state-side because they had dependents and deployment in the mission was dangerous.
SNT.16801.15390	The French Government gave special honors to the Comanches by bestowing them with the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit in 1989.
SNT.16801.15391	Mr. Chibitty was honored in 1999 when the Pentagon bestowed on him the Knowlton Award.
SNT.16801.15392	In a 1999 interview with the Armed Forces Information Center, Chibitty said: "The Navajo did the same thing."
SNT.16801.15393	"The Navajos became code talkers about a year after the Comanches, but there were over a hundred of them because they had so much territory [in the Pacific Theater] to cover."
SNT.16801.15394	Joe Holley of the Washington Post recalled this quote from Mr. Chibitty in 2002: "It’s strange, but growing up as a child I was forbidden speak my native language at school."
SNT.16801.15395	My language helped win the war, and that makes me very proud.
SNT.20307.15396	Iraq has carried out the first executions since the demise of the Saddam Hussein regime.
SNT.20307.15397	Three men convicted of murder were hanged on Thursday morning in Baghdad.
SNT.20307.15398	The Iraqi government argues that the death penalty will help to deter criminals but spokesman Laith Kubba admitted that "this is not an easy thing to do".
SNT.20307.15399	Iraqi president Jalal Talabani is personally opposed to capital punishment and stated that he would never sign a death sentence, not even against Saddam Hussein himself.
SNT.20307.15400	Human rights groups and the United Nations had hoped Iraq would refrain from using the death penalty against its citizens and urged the government not to carry out the sentences.
SNT.20307.15401	The three men, named as Bayan Ahmed Said, Ouday Dawood Salman and Dhahar Jasim Hassan were convicted of murdering three policemen in the city of Kut, Wasit province.
SNT.73979.15402	Hundreds of legal, highly-skilled workers in the United States sent hundreds of flowers to the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Emilio Gonzalez as part of a symbolic and peaceful protest over what they said was a "flip-flop" by the State Department and the USCIS on eliminating Green card processing delays.
SNT.73979.15403	Dr. Gonzalez announced on the USCIS website late last night that the flowers will be forwarded to the injured service members recuperating at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
SNT.73979.15404	In response, Immigration Voice, a non-profit organization representing skilled, legal immigrants, said that they welcome the fact that Dr. Gonzalez acknowledged the symbolic gesture of our protest and are overjoyed that these flowers will brighten the day of the injured service brethren.
SNT.73979.15405	Immigration Voice also said that it is their sacrifice for American freedom that has made this country great and such a desirable destination for multitude of people from around the world and that they wanted to say "Thank you and god bless you" to the servicemen.
SNT.22956.15406	U.S. House of Representatives majority leader Tom DeLay was today indicted in Austin, Texas by a Travis County grand jury on conspiracy charges.
SNT.22956.15407	DeLay announced that he will step down temporarily from his leadership position.
SNT.22956.15408	DeLay has publicly countered that the charges are partisan and thus politically motivated.
SNT.22956.15409	The charges originate from the District Attorney of Travis County, Ronnie Earle, a Democrat who has prosecuted Democrat and Republican office holders, including U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.
SNT.22956.15410	Mr. DeLay's attorney Steve Brittain said that DeLay was accused of a criminal conspiracy in a campaign finance scheme along with two associates, namely John Colyandro, former executive director of a Texas political action committee formed by DeLay, and Jim Ellis, the head of DeLay's national political committee.
SNT.22956.15411	Attorneys for Colyandro and Ellis have filed to have the proceedings moved out of Travis County in order to obtain a fair trial.
SNT.22956.15412	Travis County, located in central Texas, contains the state capital of Austin and is politically known as a liberal county within a conservative state, as indicated by the most recent presidential elections.
SNT.22956.15413	According to the indictment, "the defendants herein, with the intent that a felony be committed, did enter into an agreement with one or more of each other with a general purpose committee known as Texans for a Republican Majority PAC (political action committee) that one or more of them would engage in conduct that would constitute the offense of knowingly making a political contribution in violation of Subchapter D of Chapter 253 of the Texas Election Code..."
SNT.22956.15414	The indictment does not include specific charges of how DeLay was involved in the conspiracy.
SNT.22956.15415	Mr. DeLay, upon announcement of the indictment, made a solitary public comment: "I have notified the speaker that I will temporarily step aside from my position as majority leader pursuant to rules of the House Republican Conference and the actions of the Travis County district attorney today."
SNT.22956.15416	Bill White, another of DeLay's attorneys, said "it's a skunky indictment if they have one."
SNT.22956.15417	DeLay's spokesman, Kevin Madden, called the indictment "nothing more than prosecutorial retribution by a partisan Democrat," referring to prosecutor Ronnie Earle, a Democrat.
SNT.22956.15418	According to House Republican party rules, DeLay must resign upon indictment.
SNT.22956.15419	Party officials told the Associated Press that Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert R-Illinois, will likely recommend Republican David Dreier of California as replacement, while some duties may also go to Majority whip Roy Blunt, R-Missouri.
SNT.22956.15420	DeLay has previously been admonished three times by the House Ethics Committee.
SNT.22956.15421	In their October 6, 2004 letter to him, the members wrote in part concluding, "...it is clearly necessary for you to temper your future actions to assure that you are in full compliance at all times with the applicable House Rules and standards of conduct."
SNT.22956.15422	We remind you that the House Code of Official Conduct provides the Committee with authority “to deal with any given act or accumulation of acts which, in the judgment of the committee, are severe enough to reflect discredit on the Congress.”
SNT.22956.15423	House Republicans earlier eliminated the rule requiring his resignation upon indictment, but reinstated it fearing voters' outcry.
SNT.22956.15424	DeLay's Political Action Committee, Texans for a Republican Majority, was earlier indicted on charges it accepted corporate contributions mostly from the credit card industry . for use in state legislative elections.
SNT.22956.15425	Texas law prohibits corporate money from being used in elections, permitting it only for administrative expenses.
SNT.22956.15426	Having gained GOP control of Texas's legislature, DeLay masterminded a redistricting plan in 2004 that allowed the GOP to gain six seats in the U.S. House, formerly won by Democrats, and build a majority in Congress.
SNT.22956.15427	In one case, one lawmaker switched parties, to maintain office.
SNT.8659.15428	Al-Jazeera reported a few days earlier that the Iraqi militants would kill the journalists unless the Romanian government withdraws its troops from the country within four days.
SNT.8659.15429	With 850 troops, Romania has one of the largest contingents in Iraq.
SNT.8659.15430	In January this year, after President Băsescu was elected, he pledged to send more peacekeeping troops in Iraq.
SNT.8659.15431	On Friday evening, the colleagues and relatives of the journalists gathered in front of the Cotroceni Palace, Băsescu's residence, to call for their release.
SNT.8659.15432	After learning of the released tape, Băsescu returned from the GUUAM summit in Chişinău, Republic of Moldova, where he was an observer, to Bucharest, where he called for a meeting with the relevant departments to discuss the issue.
SNT.8659.15433	Reporter Marie-Jeanne Ion, from Prima TV, and cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian, from newspaper România Liberă, were kidnapped in Baghdad on March 28, one day after President Băsescu made an unexpected visit to Iraq to announce a supplement of troops.
SNT.48579.15434	Bloc Quebecois Member of Parliament Benoit Sauvageau was killed in an automobile accident on Monday morning after his vehicle hit a tow truck at the side of a road in his Montreal constituency.
SNT.48579.15435	Sauvageau, 42, had been an MP since 1993 and represented the riding of Repentigny at the time of his death.
SNT.48579.15436	"I think he was a very good member of Parliament, a very good sovereigntist," added Duceppe.
SNT.48579.15437	Visibly shaken by the news, Duceppe said: "It's awful, at 42 with four children (daughters) between the ages of five and 15, it's not right."
SNT.48579.15438	Former Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, who led the BQ when Sauvageau was first elected, told Radio Canada: "It's a tragedy."
SNT.48579.15439	"He is a man who was engaged in political fights but he did it correctly, with nobility and idealism and a lot of respect for others, even his adversaries," said Bouchard.
SNT.48579.15440	As an MP he was the Bloc's spokesperson on public accounts and the treasury board and was also the party's critic responsible for the Official Languages Act and the rights of Francophones outside of Quebec.
SNT.48579.15441	Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the prayers and thoughts of all Parliamentarians are with Sauvageau's loved ones at this difficult time.
SNT.26541.15442	President George W. Bush ordered Jose Padilla, detained by the US Military as an alleged terrorist, to be transferred out of military custody in order to face trial in a federal criminal court.
SNT.26541.15443	He is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, aiding terrorist groups and other acts against US nationals outside the United States.
SNT.26541.15444	These actions come six days ahead of a decision by the US Supreme Court on whether it should review the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling that the president is authorised to hold Padilla as an "Enemy Combatant" without charge.
SNT.26541.15445	Jose Padilla, a US citizen born in Brooklyn, has been held without charge in a military brig at a US Navy detention facility in South Carolina for the three-and-a-half years since his arrest in 2002.
SNT.26541.15446	The administration had at the time alleged that Padilla was plotting to detonate a Radioactive "dirty" bomb in the US and later, Deputy Attorney General James Comey alleged that he was involved in plots to blow up Hotels and high-rise buildings .
SNT.26541.15447	The present indictment does not include any charges over these allegations.
SNT.26541.15448	Instead, Padilla is charged with travelling abroad to train in "violent Jihad", providing material support to terrorists by sending money, physical assets, and new recruits to Jihadi groups, and conspiring to murder individuals overseas .
SNT.26541.15449	The change in custody restores to Padilla a number of rights he had been denied when the administration designated him as an "Enemy Combatant", including the right to access federal courts and be defended by an attorney.
SNT.26541.15450	That constitutionality of detaining suspects without charge under this designation has been challenged in court, on behalf of Padilla and in September, a 3-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the government's powers to detain Padilla.
SNT.26541.15451	The Supreme Court was set to decide on whether it will review that decision next week.
SNT.26541.15452	Padilla's status, for the purpose of this trial, is that of an ordinary criminal indictee, possessing the legal rights conferred on him by the US Bill of Rights.
SNT.72913.15453	A car containing an large explosive device has been defused in the Haymarket, London.

SNT.72913.15455	A car, a light metallic green Mercedes-Benz E Class saloon (produced 1984-1995), parked near the nightclub 'TigerTiger', contained petrol, gas cylinders and nails.
SNT.72913.15456	Police carried out a controlled explosion at 2:00 a.m. BST and the car has been taken to a forensic explosives laboratory for further investigation.
SNT.72913.15457	Eyewitnesses saw the car driving "erratically" and colliding with bins before being abandoned.
SNT.72913.15458	An ambulance crew in the area alerted police after seeing smoke inside the car.
SNT.72913.15459	Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner Peter Clarke said there could have been "significant injury or loss of life".
SNT.72913.15460	A meeting of COBRA, chaired by new Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was held about the incident.
SNT.72913.15461	Police say it is too early to tell who is behind the threat.
SNT.72913.15462	Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the country faces a "serious and continued security threat" and urged people to "be vigilant at all times".
SNT.72913.15463	Disruption has been caused to transport in the area with roads closed and bus routes diverted.
SNT.72913.15464	Piccadilly Circus tube station has reopened after an earlier closure

SNT.3303.15471	They expect the number to increase as more information reaches them.
SNT.3303.15472	49 casualties (close to 40%) occurred in Iraq, making it by far the deadliest country for journalists.
SNT.3303.15473	At least 20 of those appeared to be cases where journalists were directly targeted because of their profession.
SNT.3303.15474	Another country that deserved special attention was the Philippines, where 13 journalists appear to have been assassinated in separate incidents because of their reporting.
SNT.3303.15475	None of the murderers have been apprehended by the police.
SNT.3303.15476	In Nepal, two journalists were killed by security forces and one by the rebels.
SNT.279494.15477	Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, has chosen to step down from his post as CEO of the company.
SNT.279494.15478	The former Chief Operating Officer, Tim Cook will be succeeding Jobs as CEO.
SNT.279494.15479	Jobs resigned in a letter to Apple's board of directors stating, "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know."
SNT.279494.15480	In that same letter, Jobs stated that his desire was to remain as chairman of the board.
SNT.279494.15481	Steve Jobs has been fighting pancreatic cancer since 2004 and has been on medical leave since January of this year.
SNT.279494.15482	He briefly made an appearance in March and June to unveil the iPad 2 and the iCloud, an online cloud computing service.
SNT.279494.15483	In part of his resignation, Jobs left this farewell, "I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you."
SNT.279494.15484	Tim Cook was personally recommended by Jobs to take over as CEO and has been serving as interim CEO since the beginning of Jobs' medical leave.
SNT.279494.15485	Before his post at Apple, Cook held positions at IBM and Compaq.
SNT.279494.15486	Due to an operational overhaul by Cook, he is credited with the success of the iPad and MacBook Air.
SNT.279494.15487	He also stood in Steve Jobs' place while the CEO underwent liver transplant surgery.
SNT.279494.15488	He received $59 million for his performance in the position.
SNT.279494.15489	Analyst Charles Golvin predicts that the resignation will not begin to affect Apple performance for 1.5 to 2 years.
SNT.279494.15490	Many of the new products are already under development and Jobs will continue to steer the company from his position as chairman of the board.
SNT.279494.15491	Art Levinson, chairman of Genentech and a member of the board, adds, "Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration".
SNT.279494.15492	A contrary view is offered by Charles O'Reilly, a management expert at Stanford University, who stated, "Great companies rarely go from strength to strength".
SNT.279494.15493	Richard Doherty attributes Steve Jobs' success as the ability to hold off on a product until it is perfect.
SNT.279494.15494	He states "A lot of products could have gotten to market earlier, but he wanted it better."
SNT.279494.15495	In light of the revelation, Apple shares (AAPL) slid $19.37 in after hours trading—a drop of over 5%.
SNT.279494.15496	Since market open, Apple shares rose to $373.72, a drop of only $2.46 since Wednesday's close.
SNT.127320.15497	Over 60 miners were killed in an abandoned gold mine shaft near Welkom, in the Free State province of South Africa, after a fire broke out inside the mine.
SNT.127320.15498	36 bodies from the Harmony Gold mining company Eland mine shaft were brought up earlier on the weekend from depths up to 1.4 kilometers (1 mi). 
SNT.127320.15499	On Tuesday, 25 more bodies were recovered by other illegal workers.
SNT.127320.15500	"We suspect there was a fire on the 18th of May."
SNT.127320.15501	"Over the weekend [30 May] we were informed by other illegal miners that people had died," said Tom Smith, Chief Operating Officer for Harmony's South Region, "The bodies are not burnt."
SNT.127320.15502	"It seems more of a case of gas or smoke inhalation."
SNT.127320.15503	"I don't know if there are any more bodies down there, we just have to wait."
SNT.127320.15504	The workers may have died from poisonous gasses, smoke inhalation, suffocation, cave-ins or carbon monoxide poisoning.
SNT.127320.15505	Harmony gold mine will not send anyone in to the mine as the conditions are extremely dangerous and abandoned shafts are without safety equipment.
SNT.127320.15506	Illegal workers may gain access bypassing security at one mine site, and exit via a series of interconnected underground tunnels many miles away.
SNT.127320.15507	Harmony is internationally the fifth largest gold mining company and has bought up old, abandoned mines.
SNT.127320.15508	Police were seeking relatives to help identify the bodies, and are instigating an investigation into the circumstances.
SNT.127320.15509	Almost 300 "gold pirates" were arrested over the past two weeks at the Eland mine shaft alone.
SNT.127320.15510	Thousands of illegal workers can be underground, and remain working for weeks and months continuously.
SNT.127320.15511	"These are ex-miners and unemployed people - we need to target the syndicates," said Smith.
SNT.127320.15512	There are over 4.18 million unemployed in South Africa due to the economic decline, and another 1 million may soon join the ranks.
SNT.127320.15513	Welkom, with a population of over 400,000 is located northeast of Bloemfontein, the provincial capital.
SNT.141038.15514	Nearly 3,000 people demonstrated in Saint Petersburg, Russia on Saturday to oppose a proposition to construct a skyscraper in the city.
SNT.141038.15515	The demonstrators were protesting against the Okhta Center, a proposed supertall 77-story skyscraper for the gas company Gazprom measuring 400 metres (1,300 feet).
SNT.141038.15516	They said that the tower would ruin the city's skyline, famous for its historic buildings, palaces, and canals.
SNT.141038.15517	Galina Safronova, 55, said that "this action will destroy my city, the city where I grew up, and the city that I want to save for my grandchildren," as quoted by the Associated Press news agency.
SNT.141038.15518	UNESCO, the cultural body of the United Nations, warned that the skyscraper, if built, may endanger St Petersburg's world heritage site status.
SNT.141038.15519	Government officials supporting the proposal, however, said that the tower would give St Petersburg a large economic boost.
SNT.24312.15520	Wednesday night, the Houston Astros, a professional baseball team in North America, won the 2005 National League Pennant by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals by a score of 5 - 1 to achieve their 4th win in the National League Championship Series.
SNT.24312.15521	In this series, the Astros won 4 games and the Cardinals won 2 games.
SNT.24312.15522	Now that the Houston Astros are finally in the World Series, they couldn't be set up any better.
SNT.24312.15523	Their stellar rotation of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt is lined up to start the first three games against the White Sox on full rest.
SNT.24312.15524	And hard-throwing closer Brad Lidge will be refreshed physically and mentally after an exhausting stretch.
SNT.24312.15525	"We've put ourselves in a great situation, and have a wonderful chance," said Clemens, who will start Game 1 on Saturday night in Chicago against former Yankees teammate Jose Contreras.
SNT.24312.15526	Thanks to Scot McKenzie, who has won 20 games each of the past two seasons, the Astros didn't need Game 7 in the NL championship series against the St. Louis Cardinals.
SNT.24312.15527	For the second time in the NLCS, Scot allowed just one run over seven innings at Busch Stadium, leading Houston to a series-ending 5-1 victory Wednesday night.
SNT.24312.15528	So instead of having to play again Thursday night, the Astros got to go home for a day off before traveling to Chicago -- though they were only an hour-long flight from the Windy City when they beat the Cardinals.
SNT.24312.15529	It still was extra rest for the pitchers, and everybody else.
SNT.24312.15530	The city of Houston waited 44 seasons for its first World Series.
SNT.24312.15531	It comes just two years after Pettitte and Clemens joined their hometown team.
SNT.24312.15532	"What's amazing is it happened so fast," said Pettitte, the left-hander who has pitched in six World Series -- four of them won by the Yankees.
SNT.24312.15533	"Realistically, I just came home and wanted to help the team win a playoff series."
SNT.24312.15534	Clemens (3-0, 1.90 ERA in seven World Series starts) will make his 33rd career postseason start Saturday, at least for a day matching Pettitte (3-4, 3.90 in 10 World Series starts) for the most ever.
SNT.24312.15535	But Clemens also finished a game this month, going the final three innings in the Astros' 18-inning victory that ended the NL division series against Atlanta.
SNT.24312.15536	Oswalt is 4-0 in seven career playoff games (six starts), and will start the first World Series game ever in Houston, Game 3 on Tuesday night.
SNT.24312.15537	Brandon Backe, without a decision in his three starts this postseason, is scheduled for Game 4, then Clemens, Pettitte and Oswalt would go again, if necessary.
SNT.24312.15538	But the right-hander wasn't needed two nights after giving up Albert Pujols' three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and extended the NLCS.
SNT.24312.15539	"If it had been a one-run game, a two-run game, Brad would have been in," manager Phil Garner said.
SNT.24312.15540	"If the game is on the line again in any circumstances, he's our guy."
SNT.24312.15541	Before Pujols' mammoth homer, Lidge had saved three straight NLCS games and dominated the Cardinals over a two-year stretch.
SNT.24312.15542	But he was also pitching in his seventh game in 12 days, including consecutive two-inning appearances.
SNT.24312.15543	Now, Lidge is ready to pitch again after the needed rest.
SNT.24312.15544	"I'm going to be so pumped up to get out there in the World Series."
SNT.24312.15545	Clemens will be in his sixth World Series, having announced his retirement after pitching for the Yankees in the 2003 Fall Classic.
SNT.24312.15546	Urged by his buddy Pettitte to keep pitching, Clemens signed a one-year deal with the Astros.
SNT.24312.15547	The Rocket signed for another season after he won his seventh Cy Young Award and the Astros got close to the World Series in 2004, when Clemens blew a two-run lead and lost Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals.
SNT.24312.15548	"I'm glad I made the decision," said Clemens, who led the major leagues with a career-low 1.87 ERA during the regular season.
SNT.24312.15549	"Now, we're going to take a deep breath and see if we can keep this thing going."
SNT.24312.15550	"It's for the entire team, but there are special cases in this."
SNT.24312.15551	Such as Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, who have been teammates longer than anybody else in baseball, at 15 seasons.
SNT.24312.15552	"I certainly didn't feel at the beginning of the year that this was going to be the year," Bagwell said.
SNT.24312.15553	"But it's amazing what a whole bunch of pitching, and a whole bunch of guys who believe in each other, can do."
SNT.24312.15554	Bagwell has been limited to pinch-hitting duties since missing 115 games because of shoulder surgery.
SNT.24312.15555	He'll likely start as the designated hitter in the games at Chicago.
SNT.24312.15556	The final series of the baseball season will be the ultimate North American baseball championship, the World Series, a best of 7-games match-up between the American League pennant winner, the Chicago White Sox, and the National League pennant winner, the Houston Astros.
SNT.24312.15557	Game 1 of the World Series will start Saturday evening.
SNT.359245.15558	A neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality has gained prominence during the ongoing election cycle in the United States.
SNT.359245.15559	After Santorum spoke out against LGBT rights in the United States in 2003, readers of Savage’s column voted to define the word "santorum" as "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."
SNT.359245.15560	The prominence of this term's association with Santorum, a current candidate for the Republican Party presidential nomination, has had an impact on the former Senator's presidential campaign.
SNT.359245.15561	Dan Savage commented on the continued impact of the santorum neologism, in an interview with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram published Sunday, "It's still out there and it is an insanely dirty joke."
SNT.359245.15562	"It is vile, as are Santorum's comments about gay people."
SNT.359245.15563	At a speaking engagement on Friday, Santorum stated that same-sex partnerships don't "benefit society".
SNT.359245.15564	Whilst speaking as part of his campaign for the U.S. presidency in 2012, Rick Santorum has had to answer questions from supporters of LGBT rights regarding his controversial political positions on issues pertaining to them.
SNT.359245.15565	Critics have showed up to Santorum events and tried to glitter bomb the candidate.
SNT.359245.15566	Democratic strategists poised themselves to take advantage of Santorum's association with the neologism phenomenon.
SNT.359245.15567	Based on sources among Democratic operatives, Jack Cahill of American Thinker reports Democratic tactics in Missouri involve actually galvanizing support for Santorum ahead of that state's Republican caucuses in order to eliminate the possibility of a Mitt Romney win.
SNT.359245.15568	Cahill says they view Santorum as mostly a dirty joke's punchline.
SNT.359245.15569	Wikinews previously reported on the santorum neologism phenomenon in 2006, as part of an article, "Wikinews investigates Wikipedia usage by U.S. Senate staff members".
SNT.359245.15570	The investigation noted that: "An edit to an article about a controversy over Senator Rick Santorum's statements about Constitutional rights to privacy with regards to sexual acts, seemingly coming from Rick Santorum's staff members, removed a reference to an effort to redefine Santorum's last name as a neologism".
SNT.359245.15571	In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press, Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality.
SNT.359245.15572	Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator’s last name, and Savage created a website www.spreadingsantorum.com to document the spread of the phenomenon.
SNT.359245.15573	The term became a prominent result in searches online, and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!.
SNT.359245.15574	Google global communications chief Gabriel Stricker commented to National Public Radio in an interview this January, that the company was avoiding editorial judgment, and that the prominence of the santorum neologism phenomenon in web searches is due to increased interest in the subject.
SNT.359245.15575	Stricker stated, "There definitely are people who are finding this to be the best answer to their question, and they are indicating this by either clicking on this result or linking to this result as the best answer to that question."
SNT.359245.15576	In the wake of Santorum's showing in the 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses, additional curious people looked up the former Senator on the Internet and in turn discovered the santorum neologism phenomenon.
SNT.359245.15577	After journalist Laura Sydell of the National Public Radio program All Things Considered received criticism for covering the increased attention to the santorum neologism, she explained why the issue was relevant: "I felt it was an important and legitimate story in the wake of Mr. Santorum's success in Iowa."
SNT.359245.15578	"Although the site had been up for many years, it was only after Mr. Santorum's success in the caucuses that a large number of people were actually searching for more information about him."
SNT.359245.15579	The Canadian Press provided a similar analysis in January — that more coverage of Santorum has led to more coverage of the neologism.
SNT.359245.15580	Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon, in comments to the press.
SNT.359245.15581	He was quoted in January by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google's response: "I suspect if something was up there like that about, say, Joe Biden, they would get rid of it."
SNT.359245.15582	"To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle."
SNT.359245.15583	Santorum tried to alleviate the neologism's results in web searches by reaching out to Google in September, but this act only served to increase reporting and coverage of the phenomenon.
SNT.359245.15584	In a 2011 radio interview with host Steve Malzberg, Santorum characterized the neologism as "filth".
SNT.359245.15585	He criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon, saying, "It's offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it."
SNT.114652.15586	In an effort to reduce the effect of the ongoing financial crisis, six central banks worldwide have reduced their interest rates by 0.5% in an unexpected move which took place today.
SNT.114652.15587	The banks involved in the deal are the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank.
SNT.114652.15588	"Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets," said the banks in a joint statement.
SNT.114652.15589	"Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices."
SNT.114652.15590	"Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability."
SNT.114652.15591	"The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability."
SNT.114652.15592	"Accordingly, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates."
SNT.114652.15593	"The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions."
SNT.114652.15594	Japan expressed support for the move, although it did not cut its own interest rate by 0.5% as that would mean bringing its interest rate down to 0% from 0.5%.
SNT.114652.15595	The US interest rate was lowered to 1.5% as part of the move, while the UK rate was lowered to 4.5%.
SNT.114652.15596	The new rate of the Swiss National Bank is 2.5%, while Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, lowered its rate to 4.25%.
SNT.20378.15597	On September 29, Minnesota will become the first U.S. state to require diesel fuel sold at filling stations in the state to be blended with 2% biodiesel.
SNT.20378.15598	This follows the statewide mandate requiring ethanol to be mixed into gasoline—also a first by Minnesota—which took effect in 1997.
SNT.20378.15599	The biodiesel mandate was approved by the 2002 state legislature, and was sent to then-Governor Jesse Ventura.
SNT.20378.15600	Ventura allowed the bill to become law without his signature, stating his concern that the increased cost of fuel would affect the trucking industry—potentially spurring inflation—though he felt that this was nearly balanced by the positive impact the mandate would have on agriculture in the state.
SNT.20378.15601	The law had an initial target date of July 1, 2005, but would only go into effect once production capacity exceeded 8 million gallons (30 millon liters) per year.
SNT.20378.15602	At the beginning of 2005, the state was only capable of producing three million gallons each year, but two new facilities in Albert Lea and Brewster increased state capacity twentyfold when they opened this summer.
SNT.20378.15603	Each of the two new plants can produce 30 million gallons (113 ML) annually.
SNT.20378.15604	Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson verified production levels in the August 29 edition of the Minnesota State Register, meaning that the law will become effective following a month-long notification period.
SNT.20378.15605	The prices of diesel and biodiesel have equalized, so the negative economic impact initially feared by Ventura are not expected to come to pass and the effect should be pennies more or less per gallon.
SNT.20378.15606	Despite the dramatic increase in capacity, biodiesel production is not yet a broad solution to shortages or high prices—in 2001, the state used 14.3 million gallons of petroleum every day.
SNT.39014.15607	Pramod Mahajan, the general secretary of India's main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, was shot in Mumbai earlier today.
SNT.39014.15608	The attack occurred at Mahajan's residence at around 6:30 a.m. IST (0100 UTC).
SNT.39014.15609	There are few details available at this time, however sources say Mahajan was shot three times at close range by his brother Praveen Mahajan, allegedly over a property dispute.
SNT.39014.15610	His lawyer Nandkumar Rajukar claimed that he was depressed and suffering from some mental trauma.
SNT.39014.15611	Pramod Mahajan was rushed to the nearby Hinduja Hospital, where he is currently being operated upon for a serious injury to his liver.
SNT.39014.15612	A senior surgeon at the hospital stated that Mr. Mahajan was still in critical condition and that the next 72 hours would be "crucial".
SNT.39014.15613	Three bullets are still lodged in his body and doctors are finding it difficult to extract them.
SNT.39014.15614	There is talk of using the help of doctors from the armed forces, who have better experience in treating bullet injuries.
SNT.39014.15615	Mr. Mahajan's liver was severely injured in the incident, leading to massive blood loss.
SNT.39014.15616	Doctors say that he is currently on a ventilator and that the bullets cannot be removed for fear of causing even more bleeding.
SNT.39014.15617	Praveen Mahajan has been booked under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code that deals with attempt to murder.
SNT.39014.15618	He underwent a psychological examination, which indicated that he was mentally stable.
SNT.39014.15619	Senior politicians from across India are arriving in Mumbai to offer their support to the popular leader.
SNT.39014.15620	The Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh, speaker of the Indian parliament Somnath Chatterjee and the President of India A P J Abdul Kalam have expressed shock over the attack.
SNT.55610.15621	Atmospheric scientists warn that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing more rapidly, despite global efforts to curb the use of fossil fuels, new research by Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) shows.
SNT.55610.15622	According to CSIRO research scientist Dr Mike Raupach, 7.9 billion tonnes of carbon were emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide in 2005 - a doubling in the rate of increase since 1990 - and the rate of increase continues to accelerate.
SNT.55610.15623	Data from the Cape Grim air pollution monitoring station in north-west Tasmania shows carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 2.5% each year for the past five years.
SNT.55610.15624	"From 2000 to 2005, the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions was more than 2.5% per year, whereas in the 1990s it was less than 1% per year," Dr Raupach says.
SNT.55610.15625	Dr Raupach, who co-chairs the international Global Carbon Project also, was surprised by his research results.
SNT.55610.15626	"It shows recent efforts globally to reduce emissions have had little impact on emissions growth," he said.
SNT.55610.15627	The CSIRO found that in global terms, China has the highest current growth rate in CO2 emissions although it's emissions per person are below the global average.
SNT.55610.15628	China's accumulated contribution since the start the 1800s is only five per cent of the global total.
SNT.55610.15629	The USA and Europe have each contributed more than 25% of accumulated global emissions.
SNT.55610.15630	Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere — a separate measure to carbon emissions — had also increased at an unprecedented rate.
SNT.55610.15631	Dr Paul Fraser, also from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, said that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide grew by two parts per million in 2005, the fourth year in a row of above-average growth.
SNT.55610.15632	"To have four years in a row of above-average carbon dioxide growth is unprecedented," Dr Fraser said.
SNT.55610.15633	He said the trend over recent years suggests the growth rate is accelerating, "signifying that fossil fuels are having an impact on greenhouse gas concentrations in a way we haven’t seen in the past."
SNT.18522.15634	In a policy change prompted by activists staying in Gaza protesting Israel's plan to close Jewish settlements there, Israel announced that nonresidents will not be allowed into the territory.
SNT.18522.15635	Israel's Southern Command on Thursday announced "only residents of the Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip will be allowed [entry into Gaza]", where the Jewish state plans to end its decades-long presence.
SNT.18522.15636	Israel also will stop issuing permits to close relatives of settlers.
SNT.38043.15637	Legislators in the Massachusetts General Court, their name for the state legislature, approved legislation on Tuesday, April 4, that would make it the first state in the United States to require all residents to have health insurance and impose penalties for non-compliance.
SNT.38043.15638	Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, a Republican who is expected to run for U.S. President in 2008, is expected to sign the bill.
SNT.38043.15639	The bill passed the lower house, the Massachusetts House of Representatives by a vote of 155-2, and unanimously by the state senate.
SNT.38043.15640	The Democratic Party holds supermajorities in both houses of the legislature.
SNT.38043.15641	At least one other state (Hawaii) requires employers to provide employee health insurance, but no other state holds individuals accountable for coverage.
SNT.68094.15642	Manouchehr Mottaki, the foreign minsister of Iran, did not attend a dinner at Sharm el-Sheikh because the red dress of a Ukrainian violinist did not meet the "Islamic standards."
SNT.68094.15643	According to Mottaki, "There was something wrong with that so I offered my apologies."
SNT.68094.15644	The planned discussion of Condoleezza Rice and Mottaki would have been the highest-level formal talks of U.S. and Iranian officials.
SNT.68094.15645	It was intended to enable the foreign ministers to thrash out ways to curb the security problems in Iraq.
SNT.68094.15646	State Department spokesman Sean McCormack explained the issue in term of intimidation when he said, "I don't know which woman he was afraid of, the woman in the red dress or the secretary of state."
SNT.68094.15647	In lieu of a longer substantive discussion, there was a 3-minute exchange of pleasantries between Rice and Mottaki at the end.
SNT.68094.15648	However, Rice did have a complete discussion with Walid Moallem, the foreign minister of Syria, to alleviate Iraq's security problems.
SNT.68094.15649	Later, Mottaki stated that Iran believes that the presence of American troops is the source of instability and called for the withdrawal of American troops.
SNT.68094.15650	He said, "The U.S. must issue a clear troop-withdrawal plan so that peace and stability can be restored."
SNT.8642.15651	Google has translated its email service, Gmail, into 12 languages, and it has put up a form that allows the public to volunteer to translate the Gmail interface into 144 more languages.
SNT.8642.15652	While most of the languages listed in the volunteering form are old, three are relatively new: Borkborkbork, Klingon, and Esperanto.
SNT.8642.15653	Additionally, the form lists Pig Latin, which is a method of rearranging words to obscure a language, rather than a language in itself.
SNT.8642.15654	Google has also recently introduced a feature known as "My Search History," which allows users to record their searches.
SNT.8642.15655	Use of the search history requires that the user have and log in to a Google or Gmail account.
SNT.113114.15656	The International Monetary Fund and the European Union approved aid packages to help Georgia recover from its conflict with Russia, which occurred in early August.
SNT.113114.15657	The IMF approved a US$750 million loan which will allow Georgia to rebuild its currency reserves.
SNT.113114.15658	The European Union also approved an aid package of €500 million in aid by 2010, which is expected to help internally displaced people (IDPs) and economic recovery in the form of new infrastructure.
SNT.113114.15659	Only €100 million of the EU aid will be given to Georgia this year.
SNT.113114.15660	These loans are aimed to restore confidence in Georgia's economy and send a signal to international investors that Georgia's economy is sound.
SNT.113114.15661	According to the IMF, international investors have been "critical to Georgia's economic growth in recent years."
SNT.113114.15662	Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman of the IMF executive committee, said the loan will "make significant resources available to replenish international reserves and bolster investor confidence, with the aim of sustaining private capital inflows that have been critical to Georgia's economic growth in recent years."
SNT.113114.15663	Georgia has requested $2 billion in international aid to help it recover from the conflict.
SNT.113114.15664	So far, the United States has pledged $1 billion in aid.
SNT.113114.15665	Further assistance and loans to Georgia are expected from other organizations.
SNT.113114.15666	Kato noted that "...Georgia is expected to receive financial assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors and creditors in support of the reconstruction effort."
SNT.113114.15667	It is expected that an international donors' conference will take place next month to solicit more aid for the country.
SNT.113114.15668	Georgia's government expects that economic growth will be more than cut in half as a result of the conflict.
SNT.113114.15669	Last year, Georgia's GDP increased 12.4% and it is predicted by the IMF that growth will be less than 4 percent in the coming year.
SNT.3693.15670	Commander Leroy Chiao and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov have just completed their mission's first space walk aboard the International Space Station.
SNT.3693.15671	The mission lasted 5 hours, 28 minutes, ending at 1311 UTC.
SNT.3693.15672	The two astronauts, working in Russian space suits, performed a variety of tasks.
SNT.3693.15673	Chiao and Sharipov installed a work platform, called the Universal Work Platform, along with its base and associated wiring.
SNT.3693.15674	They also installed a commercial robotics experiment and a biological experiment on the exterior of the Zvezda Service Module.
SNT.3693.15675	In addition, they checked vents on systems that help control the Station's atmosphere and relocated a Japanese physical science experiment.
SNT.3693.15676	Residue accumulation around the vents of the Elektron oxygen generator was noted and photographed by Sharipov.
SNT.3693.15677	Technicians on the ground will analyze the information to determine if this residue has been contributing to the problematic operation of the Elektron.
SNT.3693.15678	During this spacewalk, the station again encountered the mysterious forces that have been saturating the Control Moment Gyros during previous spacewalks.
SNT.3693.15679	The walk marks Chiao's fifth for 31 hours, 34 minutes, accumulated time and Shapirov's first.
SNT.3693.15680	This was the 57th space walk conducted at the Station and the 32nd to be based out of the orbital outpost.
SNT.3693.15681	Expedition 10 is scheduled to conduct its second spacewalk in March.

SNT.2041.15710	December 22, 2004 The controversial European Union Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions, also called the "software patent directive" has been put to rest for 2004.
SNT.2041.15711	The directive was expected to easily pass through the European Council's Fisheries Council on Tuesday, December 21, but was removed from the agenda at the request of Poland's Minister of Science and Computerisation, Wlodzimierz Marcinski.
SNT.2041.15712	The directive's opponents, some of whom had conceded defeat on Tuesday before the vote was taken, will continue the debate informally until meetings resume in 2005.
SNT.2041.15713	Software developers, who supported the European Parliament's proposal last year to definitively rule out software patents, welcomed the delay as a chance to reintroduce those provisions into the current draft.
SNT.2041.15714	Florian Mueller, campaign manager of NoSoftwarePatents.com, which is supported by three IT companies (1&1, Red Hat, and MySQL AB), applauded Poland's move.
SNT.2041.15715	"The Polish government deserves greatest admiration for its courage!" said Mueller in a press release.
SNT.2041.15716	"Now Europe has the opportunity to have a constructive debate on the severe shortcomings of the current Council text, under the new Luxembourgish EU presidency next year."
SNT.2041.15717	Germany's representative also backed the delay, saying it would allow everyone to align the current proposal to changes proposed by the European Parliament last year.
SNT.2041.15718	"We were well aware that [the current proposal] has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European Parliament," Germany's Federal Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries said in a Tuesday statement.
SNT.2041.15719	"We will continue to work constructively toward finding a solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the decision taken in May of this year."
SNT.2041.15720	On May 18, 2004 EU Council reached a political agreement on a "Common Position" on the directive which ignored the European Parliament's vote from last year.
SNT.2041.15721	Later, the Dutch parliament failed to convince its EU representatives to reverse their vote.
SNT.2041.15722	According to the new voting weights which took effect on November 1, the majority needed to formally adopt the Common Position (after translations were done) is questionable.
SNT.2041.15723	The 20 countries that supported the Directive on May 18 fall short of the new qualified majority by 16 votes.
SNT.19746.15724	Berlin's Neukoellner Opera House is causing a stir with its new production, The Yellow Princess.
SNT.19746.15725	The story presented in the French opera, by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artist "whose life is dictated by a love for drugs and Japan."
SNT.19746.15726	As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.
SNT.19746.15727	Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical "artistic licence", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law.
SNT.19746.15728	Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be "improved with a few joints and some appetising lines", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could "get away with."
SNT.19746.15729	"Artistic licence" is at par to an "artistic liberty", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself.
SNT.19746.15730	For example a visual artist painting a landscape might move a tree to another area of their work, for better balance, or a poet ignoring pentameter when writing a traditional sonnet.
SNT.75833.15731	Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could claim victory in Sunday's House of Councillors elections.
SNT.75833.15732	The House of Councillors is the upper house in the bicameral National Diet of Japan.
SNT.75833.15733	Of the 242 seats, DPJ went from 82 to 109 seats, making it the largest party in the House of Councillors.
SNT.75833.15734	This gain came largely at the expense of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which went from 119 seats to 83.
SNT.75833.15735	Also losing seats was LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito Party (NKP), which lost 4 councillor seats and now holds 20.
SNT.75833.15736	Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that while he takes the result of the election "very seriously," he does not intend to resign his post.
SNT.75833.15737	"We must take these results very seriously and reflecting on what we must reflect on," Abe said at a news conference.
SNT.75833.15738	"I want to fulfill my responsibility to proceed with reform to build the nation and promote economic growth that the people can feel."
SNT.75833.15739	The election result will not force the government out of power, since the LDP holds 296 of the 480 seats in the House of Representatives.
SNT.75833.15740	"Voters said we must reflect on our shortcomings and refresh the line-up," Abe said.
SNT.75833.15741	"I plan to reshuffle the Cabinet and top party posts at an appropriate time."
SNT.75833.15742	He really needs to accept the results of the election and think about the future.
SNT.75833.15743	"This might include quitting," 38-year-old civil servant Akihiro Kodaira told Reuters.
SNT.109525.15744	A car crash in the British region of Leicestershire has resulted in the deaths of six people: three men and three women.
SNT.109525.15745	The incident, involving a lorry and a Ford Mondeo, occurred at around 01:00 UTC today (02:00 local time) on the A607 road.
SNT.109525.15746	Simon Adkin of the local police said that, "the black Mondeo was travelling towards Leicester and the lorry was travelling in the opposite direction."
SNT.109525.15747	He announced that the police "are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident and saw either of these vehicles beforehand to get in touch."
SNT.109525.15748	The driver of the Ford, who was killed in the incident, was a 23-year-old male.
SNT.109525.15749	An 18-year-old man, 19-year-old woman and 18-year-old woman were also killed in the incident.
SNT.109525.15750	The ages of the other two people are not yet known.
SNT.109525.15751	As a result of the crash, the A607 is expected to remain closed for most of today.
SNT.163283.15752	The Illinois House of Representatives voted this Thursday to lift some penalties for teenagers who engage in sexting.
SNT.163283.15753	While minors are still prohibited from sending nude photos of other minors taken on cell phones, they will no longer be required to register as sex offenders.
SNT.163283.15754	Instead, they could be punished with court-ordered supervision or community service. 
SNT.163283.15755	The bill, which was sponsored by State Representative Darlene Senger from Naperville, passed with a 114–1 majority and will be considered by the Illinois Senate.
SNT.163283.15756	The lone dissenter, State Representative Careen Gordon from Morris, declined to comment on her vote. 
SNT.21674.15757	The adult literacy program Read Santa Clara marked its tenth anniversary today with a gathering of program participants, staff, and supporters from the community.
SNT.21674.15758	Read Santa Clara trains volunteer tutors and matches them with adult learners who wish to build their literacy skills.
SNT.21674.15759	In the presentation, program staff and supporters reviewed the program's history and growth, honored long-time participants, and looked toward the future.
SNT.21674.15760	Santa Clara Mayor Patricia Mahan spoke at the gathering, noting, "Read Santa Clara joins people who need to learn with people who need to teach, and what a powerful combination that is."

SNT.81287.15786	Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton starting from pole wins the FIA Formula-1 2007 Japanese Grand Prix at the Fuji Speedway, Oyama, Japan.
SNT.81287.15787	It was the first race on this circuit since 1977, when James Hunt won the race for McLaren-Ford.
SNT.81287.15788	A rainy and foggy weekend at Fuji appeared to be very hard for all drivers as the race ran longer then expected and the drivers have to concentrate more due to severe weather conditions.
SNT.81287.15789	The race started behind the safety car which stayed on a track for an unusually long time, about 40 minutes.
SNT.81287.15790	Both Ferrari drivers, who managed to get the second row on the starting grid in the Saturday qualifying session were out of the game on the first laps due to their tyre selection mistake - drivers were forced to change to extreme wet tyres after a few driving errors.
SNT.81287.15791	When the pace car finally turned off the lights giving the drivers a clear road Hamilton quickly got away from his teammate, Fernando Alonso, who had more fuel on board and thus had a heavier car.
SNT.81287.15792	Alonso would be eliminated after 41 laps in a driving accident.
SNT.81287.15793	Heikki Kovalainen driving for Renault finally leads to a first podium finish for the team in this season, the Finn managed to get second place.
SNT.81287.15794	Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber both nearly finished on the podium, but a collision between their Toro Rosso and Red Bull sponsored vehicles took them out of the race.
SNT.81287.15795	Renault-engined cars did well in the race with David Coulthard and Giancarlo Fisichella finishing in 4th and 5th places.

SNT.77437.15803	Hurricane Dean hit the coast of Mexico's mainland today as a Category 2 hurricane, with winds sustained at 100 mph.
SNT.77437.15804	Dean moved across the Bay of Campeche, eyeing over 100 oil platforms and several oil ports in the center of the country's oil industry.
SNT.77437.15805	Over 14,000 workers in the area had to be evacuated.
SNT.77437.15806	The eye of the storm hit Tecolutla, a major tourist town.
SNT.77437.15807	Currently, there are no reports of deaths or serious injuries following the landfall in Mexico.
SNT.77437.15808	However, the storm caused major damage to some areas with very heavy rains shutting down many roadways and flooding many homes.
SNT.77437.15809	Overall Dean is being blamed for at least 20 deaths in the Caribbean.
SNT.77437.15810	The storm has since been downgraded to Category 1 status.
SNT.273486.15811	British singer Amy Winehouse died today in her London home in Camden Square, aged 27.
SNT.273486.15812	The cause of death is not yet known and is being treated as "unexplained", according to the metropolitan police.
SNT.273486.15813	"On arrival, officers found the body of a 27-year-old female who was pronounced dead at the scene", said a police statement on their website.
SNT.273486.15814	An ambulance was called to her address where paramedics reported her dead on the scene at around 16:00 local time (15:00 UTC) in London.

SNT.104805.15816	At least 400 homes have been evacuated in Sierra Madre near Los Angeles, California after a wildfire which started on Saturday, began to threaten their homes.
SNT.104805.15817	So far only five percent of the 350 acre fire is contained, with over 400 firefighters battling the blaze.
SNT.104805.15818	Authorities say that it has been over 40 years since some parts of the land have caught fire.
SNT.104805.15819	Authorities say the investigation into how it started may take up to three days to finish.
SNT.104805.15820	So far there have been no injuries and no homes have yet been damaged, but one building storing equipment used by firefighters was burned to the ground.
SNT.104805.15821	For a short time, at least 100 hikers were trapped in the mountains and a boy scout camp was also threatened by the blaze.
SNT.104805.15822	Several people celebrating a wedding have also been trapped by the fire but are not injured and authorities say they are in no danger from the blaze.
SNT.104805.15823	However, there are currently around 1000 people under mandatory evacuations, and the city has been declared in a state of emergency.
SNT.104805.15824	It could take at least five days before the fire can be brought under full control.
SNT.122986.15825	Portions of Wikileaks.org, the "uncensorable Wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis", has been blocked in Australia.
SNT.122986.15826	Wikinews has also learned that three URL links to Wikipedia, a free, online encyclopedia anyone can edit, have also been blocked.
SNT.122986.15827	Portions of the video sharing website YouTube have also been blocked.
SNT.122986.15828	The websites are among thousands of others that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), a government owned entity, block access to when using their blocking software.
SNT.122986.15829	The alleged three lists, from 2008 and 2009, were leaked to Wikileaks who published the documents.
SNT.122986.15830	Most of the blocked websites are ones hosting hardcore pornography.
SNT.122986.15831	According to their website, the ACMA's role in regards to the internet is to "address community concerns about offensive and illegal material online and, in particular, to protect children from exposure to material that is unsuitable for them."
SNT.122986.15832	Despite the alleged leak, Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in Australia, much of the listed websites were never an issue with the ACMA, but that some of the websites are.
SNT.122986.15833	He also goes on to say that anyone publishing the content of the ACMA's list will face criminal prosecution.
SNT.122986.15834	"I am aware of reports that a list of URLs has been placed on a website."
SNT.122986.15835	"ACMA is investigating this matter and is considering a range of possible actions it may take including referral to the Australian Federal Police."
SNT.122986.15836	"Any Australian involved in making this content publicly available would be at serious risk of criminal prosecution," said Conroy in a statement to the press.
SNT.122986.15837	Wikileaks insists the list is real and that publishing the three of them reflects what ones were added in the past, then removed or vice versa.
SNT.122986.15838	"Between the 11th and yesterday, the company did an enormous cleanup of the list."
SNT.122986.15839	"No doubt as a result of the list appearing on Wikileaks."
SNT.122986.15840	"Where the list previously contained over 2000 URLs, and Conroy and the ACMA claimed 'See! Our 'current list' never contained that many URLs', this new list is about the size the ACMA claimed it to be," said Wikileaks in a statement posted on their website.
SNT.122986.15841	Wikileaks recently leaked documents that revealed the ACMA's alleged list of 2,395 blocked websites, portions of Wikileaks being among them.
SNT.122986.15842	Of the three lists, the final one shows that the ACMA "cleaned up" their list, according to Wikileaks.
SNT.122986.15843	One of the blacklisted URLs to Wikileaks includes a leaked list of blocked websites in Denmark.
SNT.122986.15844	Not included on the list is the leaked list of blocked websites in Thailand.
SNT.122986.15845	"This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring Wikileaks."
SNT.122986.15846	"Australian democracy must not be permitted to sleep with this loaded gun."
SNT.122986.15847	"If Australia's 'Senator for Censorship', Steven Conroy, has his way, Australia will be the first Western country to have a mandatory Internet censorship regime," said Wikileaks in another statement on their website.
SNT.122986.15848	"The first rule of censorship is that you cannot talk about censorship".
SNT.122986.15849	Portions of Wikipedia blocked include a photo taken by Wikinews contributor David Shankbone titled The making of an adult film by David Shankbone.
SNT.122986.15850	The URL was added to the ACMA's list on July 28, 2008.
SNT.122986.15851	However, Wikinews has learned that the file was deleted from Wikimedia Commons on January 21, by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales by "user request: Courtesy delete per request of uploader".
SNT.122986.15852	It was deleted more than one year after the ACMA added the URL to its list.
SNT.122986.15853	Other portions of Wikipedia that are blocked are pages belonging to users Cyde and Ewlyahoocom.
SNT.122986.15854	Wikinews contacted the ACMA for a statement, but as of this report, there was no response.
SNT.122986.15855	Wikinews also contacted Mr. Wales who confirmed the file was deleted because he was asked to do so.
SNT.122986.15856	"This had nothing to do with Australia," said Wales to Wikinews.
SNT.122986.15857	Wales did not say whether he was aware of the specific file linked to Wikipedia was being blocked.
SNT.122986.15858	The Wikipedia URLs appear on all three lists leaked by Wikileaks.
SNT.122986.15859	Another image, in the same photo set was also deleted by Mr. Wales on the same day, but that URL does not appear on the alleged ACMA list.
SNT.122986.15860	It underwent a request for deletion in 2008, which was later deleted despite it being discussed as 'keep'.
SNT.122986.15861	An anonymous source told Wikinews that the images were sexually explicit and featured three men, pornography star Michael Lucas, Rodrigo diCarli and Kurt Wild, having anal intercourse.
SNT.122986.15862	Shankbone told Wikinews that he has "no comment for this story."
SNT.122986.15863	Websites caught linking to or promoting websites on the ACMA's block list could face a fine of AU$11,000 per day if they don't remove the content in question within 24 hours of receiving a notice from the ACMA.
SNT.122986.15864	The same standard can be enforced on an international level.
SNT.122986.15865	Fines can be imposed on websites outside Australia that link to material on its list.
SNT.189902.15866	The MTR Corporation, the only railway company in Hong Kong since the rail merge in 2007, has loosened their rules.
SNT.189902.15867	The corporation proposed the new modifications, then transferred the proposal to the Legislative Council, and will be effective from September 2010.
SNT.189902.15868	The new set of rules allow 'non-disruptive' use of profanity in private conversations, and the punishment for inflammatory use of expletives is lowered from a fine of HK$5000 to HK$2000.
SNT.189902.15869	The new set of rules have also excluded the regulation against wandering in MTR premises, as well as the rule against attempting to eat or drink.
SNT.189902.15870	Democratic Party member James To has expressed his concerns about a new rule that outlaws the display of promotional material.
SNT.189902.15871	According to To, the wearing of Tiananmen Square Incident-related T-shirts or acting the Goddess of Democracy may breach the new MTR rules.
SNT.189902.15872	He also deems two other regulations, namely the prohibition of distracting MTR staff members and photography and video-recording in the train carriages, 'unreasonable'.
SNT.189902.15873	Unionist Li Fung-ying is also confused whether chewing gum was considered food.
SNT.189902.15874	MTR head of operations Choi Tak-tsan replied that only what is regarded as food counts.
SNT.189902.15875	They had not yet discussed on this matter, said Choi, and will soon.
SNT.189902.15876	Li is also concerned about the rule which prohibits the entering of the first-class carriage without buying a ticket.
SNT.189902.15877	Her main concern is whether the passenger will be allowed to buy the ticket rather than being fined HK$500.
SNT.189902.15878	Wong Kwok-hing believes that the MTR corporation should call upon more effort to advertise a more 'civilised' and 'polite' way of taking the train.
SNT.189902.15879	Jeffrey Lam thinks that the new rules do not do enough to restrict shouting.
SNT.189902.15880	MTR replied that anyone who shouts in the train can be advised to leave the train or even prosecuted.
SNT.112839.15881	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that started preliminary experiments on September 10, 2008 in CERN,Geneva, and the planned International Linear Collider (ILC) will carry out a series of experiments in the future to validate the standard model of particle physics.
SNT.112839.15882	The model predicts that Higgs boson particles gives mass to all fundamental particles and explains the existence of dark matter, or invisible matter in between galaxies.
SNT.112839.15883	The LHC is a 27 kilometer long circular high energy particle accelerator which took more than 20 years and USD $9 billion to build.
SNT.112839.15884	In the next few weeks the machine will collide opposing beams of protons charged with approximately 7 TeV of energy resulting in cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time, a re-creation of the Big Bang.
SNT.112839.15885	An upgraded version of the LHC was announced, nicknamed the "super LHC".
SNT.112839.15886	The new accelerator will perform ten times the number of collisions as the current LHC over the same time.
SNT.112839.15887	The upgrade will feature a new injection system and enhanced detectors to cope with the increase in data packets from collisions.
SNT.112839.15888	The bigger International Linear Collider, nicknamed "Einstein's telescope", is planned by the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP).
SNT.112839.15889	The ILC will have a collision energy of 500 GeV and will collide electrons with particles of antimatter, called positrons, along a 30-40 km completely straight tunnel.
SNT.112839.15890	The ILC's two giant "guns" pointing at each other would be able to accelerate electrons and positrons to near-light speeds before smashing them together.
SNT.112839.15891	"The LHC smashes protons together to discover new particles but also generates lots of debris that obscures the fine detail."
SNT.112839.15892	"The ILC would be a much cleaner machine and tell us far more about their real nature."says Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University and European director of the project.
SNT.112839.15894	The host country for the ILC has not yet been chosen but it is planned to have the machine constructed by late 2010.
SNT.112839.15895	The new machine will cost an estimated USD $7 billion to build.
SNT.112839.15896	Physicists hope that ILC might be able to resolve some of the questions raised by Einstein's theories of relativity.
SNT.83883.15897	Astronauts and ground controllers are looking at apparent damage to the International Space Station P6 4B solar array spotted by the crew during deployment.
SNT.83883.15898	NASA halted the deployment of the solar array wing to evaluate the damage.
SNT.83883.15899	Deployment is about 75 percent complete with 25 of 31 bays deployed.
SNT.83883.15900	The crew has been asked to photograph the area on the solar array wing and downlink the images to the ground.
SNT.83883.15901	Shuttle Discovery is presently docked to the ISS during mission STS-120.
SNT.636316.15902	The Church of England are planning to allow gay men who are celibate and in a civil partnership to become bishops according to an announcement made by the House of Bishops.
SNT.636316.15903	This expands a previous decision made in 2005 allowing gay clergy with civil partners.
SNT.636316.15904	Whether gay clergyman would be allowed to become bishops became an issue in 2003 with the appointment of Rev Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading.
SNT.636316.15905	Jeffrey John was forced to step down from his position and now serves as Dean of St Albans Cathedral.
SNT.636316.15906	In 2010, he was also a candidate to become Bishop of Southwark but was rejected, allegedly because of his sexual orientation.
SNT.636316.15907	Anglican evangelicals have suggested such a change ought to have been passed by the General Synod rather than the House of Bishops.
SNT.636316.15908	Chris Sugden from Anglican Mainstream said the change coming from the House of Bishops "looks too much like salami-slicing away at the Church's teaching".
SNT.636316.15909	Former Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali raised questions about what celibacy means for a gay bishop: "Does the admission of those in civil partnerships to the episcopate, who state they are celibate, include those who were previously in actively homophile relationships including with their present partner?"
SNT.636316.15909-	"The House of Bishops statement does not elaborate on this point but it is crucial to an understanding of what celibacy might mean in this context."
SNT.636316.15910	In November, the General Synod voted against proposals to allow the appointment of women as bishops.
SNT.74857.15911	The available information about the phosphorous cloud following the railway accident in the Ukraine last Monday is becoming more and more cryptic.
SNT.74857.15912	The political involvement of most media and other factors are causing contradictions among official sources that are making press work extremely hard.
SNT.74857.15913	Moreover, no one is permitted to enter the accident location.
SNT.74857.15914	The site of the accident was closed to visitors following the injury of three TV journalists who got too close.
SNT.5622.15915	The BBC's political debate show Question Time aired a special edition from Shanghai yesterday.
SNT.5622.15916	This was the first time that a political show from the West was made in China.
SNT.5622.15917	The show was broadcast on BBC One and BBC World; however, it wasn't shown in China, as a condition of the programme amid fears that it would be inflammatory and present negative views of the government.
SNT.5622.15918	The panel contained the Chinese politician Liu Jianchao,who is the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman and Long Yongtu who is General Secretary for the Boao Forum for Asia, together with Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, Isobel Hilton, a writer who has a large knowledge of China & David Tang, fashion designer.
SNT.5622.15919	The audience contained a mixture of Chinese and Westerners together with people invited by the government.
SNT.5622.15920	The questions concerned, among other things, the next chief-executive of Hong Kong, China's attitudes toward Taiwan, whether China has growing problems concerning spoilt children, the growing human rights question, and whether China will economically overtake America in 20 years time.
SNT.5622.15921	Many members of the audience liked the show and hoped a similar show will be broadcast in China, in a few years time.
SNT.5622.15922	The program, which was part of a week-long BBC focus on China, was hailed as a sign that China was becoming more liberal and accommodating to Western media presence and involvement in China.
SNT.174568.15923	The mayor of Champaign, Illinois denies that Barack Obama is eligible to hold the highest office in the United States, joining others who question the validity of the president's birth certificate.
SNT.174568.15924	"You know, if you're not willing to produce an original certificate like a birth certificate, then you've got something to hide."
SNT.174568.15925	The Republican, three-term mayor of the central Illinois city made the comment to a man holding a video camera during a Tea Party protest at West Side Park in Champaign.
SNT.174568.15926	The man who recorded him apparently was an anti-Tea Party student from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.
SNT.174568.15927	Schweighart's concerns reflect those held by some Tea Party proponents and "birthers", who claim that Obama is not eligible to be the president because he was not born in the United States.
SNT.174568.15928	Although officials in Hawaii have confirmed that Obama was born there, birthers still insist that he has not proven his constitutional eligibility as a natural born citizen.
SNT.174568.15929	Champaign County Board member Al Kurtz, declaring himself "flabbergasted" by the remarks, has called on the mayor to resign.
SNT.174568.15930	"It's a ridiculous statement to make, and that's why I felt like he polarized the city with those kinds of bias."
SNT.174568.15931	"I think from this statement, it will make him a very ineffective mayor," he said.
SNT.174568.15932	Other local politicians are less concerned by Schweighart's comment, such as city council member Marci Dodds, who does not believe the mayor should resign.
SNT.174568.15933	"I respect the mayor greatly but I am somewhat disheartened by his comments."
SNT.174568.15934	"If we all get fired for making dumb comments, we'd sure be moving around a lot," she said.
SNT.9531.15935	In the case of a Marine who fired upon an unarmed and wounded Iraqi in a mosque in November 2004, the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service, headed by Major General Richard Natonski, ruled that the soldier acted in self-defense, and within the law of armed conflict.
SNT.9531.15936	In a statement released by the Marine Corps: "He has determined that the actions of the Marine in question were consistent with the established rules of engagement, the law of armed conflict and the Marine's inherent right of self-defense."
SNT.9531.15937	In a videotape of the event, the Camp Pendleton U.S. marine raises his weapon and fires into the body of a Iraqi lying up against a wall in a mosque.
SNT.9531.15938	When the Marine approached the wounded man, the marine is heard on the videotape saying, "He's f****** faking he's dead; he's faking he's f****** dead."
SNT.9531.15939	Then he fired his rifle point-blank at the man's head, at which point a companion said, "Well, he's dead now."
SNT.9531.15940	The shootings occurred inside a mosque during a U.S. offensive that led to house-to-house fighting in southern Falluja last November.
SNT.9531.15941	A television journalist embedded with the Marines recorded the killing on videotape.
SNT.9531.15942	The man killed was one of several Iraqi insurgents who had been wounded in fighting and then disarmed by marines, who then moved on leaving the wounded men in the mosque.
SNT.9531.15943	The next day a second line of marines moved through the area, who fought with more insurgents.
SNT.9531.15944	Due to the time that had passed since the first wave of marines, the second line assumed that any buildings could have been re-occupied by insurgents.
SNT.9531.15945	The corporal found wounded men in the mosque when they searched it.
SNT.9531.15946	At that moment marines from the first line of attack were approaching the mosque, among them the journalist, who had also been there the first time.
SNT.9531.15947	When they entered the journalist taped what he saw, the same people who were left there, disarmed.
SNT.9531.15948	Some were still alive and one marine thought a man lying on the ground was a threat because one of his arms was not clearly visible, so he could be hiding a weapon.
SNT.9531.15949	However, instead of keeping him covered so another could search him he shot him, while the journalist was taping it.
SNT.9531.15950	When the marine saw this and heard that these men had already been disarmed before he shouted that he didn't know that.
SNT.9531.15951	In sworn testimony, the corporal said he thought the people in the mosque were a threat.
SNT.9531.15952	A known tactic of anti-Iraqi forces (AIF) is to feign injury or death, and the marine could reasonably claim they were still a threat.
SNT.9531.15953	"The evidence supports the conclusion that the shooting of all three AIF by the corporal during the assault on the mosque was consistent with the ROE (rules of engagement)."
SNT.9531.15954	"The evidence indicates that based on the actions of those AIF, the corporal reasonably believed that they posed a hostile threat to him and his fellow Marines and justifiably fired in self-defense."
SNT.9531.15955	"The enhanced videotape of the shooting supports the corporal's claim that the wounded AIF was concealing his left arm behind his head."
SNT.9531.15956	"While it is not clear whether the AIF in the videotape made any overtly threatening gestures, it is clear that the Marines of 3/1, to include the corporal, were aware that feigning death was a common enemy TTP (tactics, techniques & procedures)."
SNT.9531.15957	"Accordingly, it was reasonable to believe that the corporal fired on the AIF after reasonably believing that the individual was committing a hostile act by exhibiting a known enemy TTP (feigning death and subsequently moving his concealed arm)."
SNT.9531.15958	"Based on all the evidence in the case, and the rules of engagement that were in effect at the time, it is clear that the corporal could have reasonably believed that the AIF shown in the videotape posed a hostile threat justifying his use of deadly force."
SNT.9531.15959	Kevin Sites, the NBC TV journalist who taped the event as "pool" footage, was embedded with the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment when it neutralized Fallujah.
SNT.9531.15960	The incident in the mosque raised considerable controversy over whether embedded journalists should maintain a neutral point of view.
SNT.9531.15961	The unedited footage was aired extensively by Al Jazeera over the months following the incident.
SNT.9531.15962	Sharif Hikmat Nashashibi of the Arab Media Watch said the footage would support the idea in the Middle East that the prime concern of US forces is not the welfare of Iraqis.
SNT.9531.15963	In the USA, however, the shooting itself was not shown because NBC considered it too shocking.
SNT.9531.15964	Now that Sites is no longer embedded he wants to bring the whole story out in the open.
SNT.9531.15965	Despite the fact that Sites introduced the footage with a long explanation of how the soldiers were under a lot of stress, which could easily cloud their judgement, he received thousands of hate-mails per day and even death-threats
SNT.9531.15966	Sites later responded to the criticism in an open letter to the regiment in his weblog.
SNT.41899.15967	A roadside bomb in the Iraq capital Baghdad has killed four people, including two journalists working for television network CBS.
SNT.41899.15968	The two journalists, cameraman Paul Douglas and soundman James Brolan, both British, were embedded with the American 4th Infantry Division and were on a routine patrol when a nearby car packed with explosives was detonated.
SNT.41899.15969	An U.S. army officer and an Iraqi interpreter were also killed.
SNT.41899.15970	CBS correspondent Kimberly Dozier, who the journalists were working with, was seriously injured and was flown to an U.S. military hospital to receive surgery.
SNT.41899.15971	With the addition of these two journalists, Iraq is now "the deadliest war for reporters in the past century", according to Editor and Publisher, the total coming to seventy-one.
SNT.41899.15972	This compares to sixty-nine reporters killed during World War Two, and sixty-three in Vietnam.
SNT.38369.15973	Alexander Downer, Australia's foreign affairs minister, told the Cole Inquiry yesterday that it was not his department's job to investigate claims that wheat exporter AWB was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein in the lead up to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
SNT.38369.15974	Mr Downer, who entered the inquiry via a back entrance to avoid the crowd waiting outside told the inquiry numerous times that he did not read a series of diplomatic cables which raised concerns about AWB in Iraq.
SNT.38369.15975	Mr Downer admitted that he did not have the time to read diplomatic cables and the only time he did so was when he is "stuck on a plane" and has nothing else to read.
SNT.38369.15976	The claims are in stark contrast to a statement made to parliament in February where Mr Downer said "Of course I would have read them".
SNT.38369.15977	When asked why the department of foreign affairs and trade did nothing about the allegations first received in 2000, he told the inquiry that his department couldn't investigate AWB and responsibility for the oil for food program laid with the UN.
SNT.38369.15978	"The department does not have the legal authority to go into AWB and access their files" he said.
SNT.38369.15979	"They (the UN) also had people on the ground in Iraq because insofar as there could be infringements of the sanctions regime, those infringements could take place within Iraq and Australia had no access to Iraq during that period."
SNT.38369.15980	Mr Downer admitted that the department of foreign affairs and trade had dealt with each cable, despite he not reading them and that were satisfied with assurances from AWB that there was no substance to the allegations.
SNT.38369.15981	Mr Downer was also asked about an unassessed intelligence report, sent to the National Security Committee of cabinet which raised concerns about Alia, the Jordanian trucking company used by the AWB to transport wheat around Iraq.
SNT.38369.15982	The document alleged that Alia may have been paying kickbacks to the Iraqi regime.
SNT.38369.15983	Mr Downer told the inquiry that the intelligence may not have been dealt with.
SNT.38369.15983-1	"There is so much intelligence."
SNT.38369.15984	"It's a very major challenge, to deal with intelligence" he said.
SNT.38369.15985	When asked by Terry Forrest, counsel for AWB executives what the point of sending intelligence to his department when it was never read, Mr Downer conceded that it was "physically impossible" to read it all.
SNT.38369.15986	Mr Downer was also questioned about a cable delivered in June 2003 from US army captain Puckett which claimed that every contract under the UN's oil for food program contained a kickback.
SNT.38369.15987	Mr Downer told the inquiry he didn't see the cable as being important because the information was provided by "a junior officer in the US army".
SNT.38369.15988	Mr Downer denied claims made by former AWB executive Andrew Lindberg that he had been told about the possibility that money may have been paid to Iraq by Alia.
SNT.38369.15989	According to Mr Downer it is common practice in his department to have two advisors at such meetings, where one of them takes notes so there is a record of what is said.
SNT.38369.15990	According to Mr Downer, no notes were taken during the meeting despite it being "the usual practice".
SNT.38369.15991	Mr Downer told the inquiry that he had no idea why notes weren't taken during the meeting, despite the meeting being quite important.
SNT.38369.15992	He also told the inquiry that he couldn't recall if he noticed that nobody was taking notes as he would have been "focused a little more on the meeting than on somebody taking notes".
SNT.88841.15993	Microprocessor company Intel Corporation has quit the board of directors for the One Laptop Per Child association (OLPC), a non-profit organization that aims to provide children in developing countries with inexpensive laptops.
SNT.88841.15994	An Intel spokesman cited a "philosophical impasse" as the reason for the split.
SNT.88841.15995	Intel joined the OLPC board in July 2007, agreeing to give financial and technological support to the project.
SNT.88841.15996	Development began on a new laptop using an Intel processor rather than the current processor made by Advanced Micro Devices, a rival of Intel.
SNT.88841.15997	A prototype of this machine was expected to be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Les Vegas, Nevada, which begins in a few days.
SNT.88841.15998	According to Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy, OLPC had repeatedly asked Intel to abandon its support for the Classmate PC, a similar laptop designed for children in developing countries, and focus entirely on the OLPC program.
SNT.88841.15999	"At the end of the day, we decided we couldn't accommodate that request," Mulloy said.
SNT.88841.16000	OLPC President Walter Bender said in an interview that Intel's resignation will have "no impact" on the program.
SNT.88841.16001	"We never really got much going with Intel to have an impact," Bender said.
SNT.88841.16002	He criticized Intel for a "seemingly half-hearted effort" in developing the new laptops and for using the agreement to make "marketing statements".
SNT.79115.16003	Tournament hosts France slumped to a shock defeat against Argentina in the opening match of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.
SNT.79115.16004	France looked shaky, making errors throughout and Argentina took the lead early on through penalties from Felipe Contepomi.
SNT.79115.16005	Ignacio Corleto scored the only try of the match for Argentina in the 27th minute, but Contepomi missed the conversion, hitting the post.
SNT.79115.16006	At half time Argentina led by 17 points to 9, with all France's points coming from penalties scored by David Skrela.
SNT.79115.16007	Although France improved in the second half, Argentina's strong defence held them off and France were only able to close the lead to five points when David Skrela scored his fourth penalty of the match in the 60th minute.
SNT.79115.16008	Skrela and his replacement Frederic Michalak both missed penalties, damaging French chances of a comeback.
SNT.79115.16009	This is the first time that the French have lost during the pool stages of the World Cup.
SNT.79115.16010	2003 champions England start defending their title tomorrow when they play the United States.
SNT.79115.16011	Australia face Japan while New Zealand, who are one of the favourites to win the tournament, play Italy.
SNT.114367.16012	Floods in the Algerian town of Ghardaïa which is in the M'zab Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, have killed at least 29 people according to local officials and Ali Belkhir, the head of public health for the north African country.
SNT.114367.16013	Belkhir confirmed that "following these floods, we can sadly declare that 29 people have died."
SNT.114367.16014	He also said that 84 people were injured, although the Algerian interior ministry has since lowered the toll to 48.
SNT.114367.16015	Six hundred homes were also flooded in the incident, and several hundred people were evacuated by helicopter.
SNT.114367.16016	According to reports on Algerian national radio, there may also be undiscovered damage in towns nearby Ghardaïa, which is approximately 600 kilometres from the Algerian capital, Algiers.
SNT.114367.16017	The flooding was caused by storms that flooded a seasonal river, known locally as a wadi, which can rise quickly by around 8 metres.
SNT.316503.16018	A judge in Montana yesterday released Barry Beach after 28 years and eleven months behind bars.
SNT.316503.16019	Beach confessed to a 1979 killing but has since maintained his innocence and now he's been granted a new trial.
SNT.143490.16020	Residents of the suburb of Minyama, Australia have come to a compromise with restaurant chain McDonald's.
SNT.143490.16021	A 24 hour store was planned for the suburb but the fast food giant backed down agreeing that the store will only open overnight on Fridays and Saturdays.
SNT.143490.16022	Every other day it will be open from five in the morning to eleven at night.
SNT.143490.16023	As part of the compromise, a walkway connecting the suburb's main road to the residential area near the new McDonald's has been closed off.
SNT.143490.16024	"They will all be restricted to Nicklin Way," said John Meyer-Gleaves, a spokesperson for protest group Say No To McDonald's, referring to late night customers.
SNT.143490.16025	The group also managed to get a higher wall placed between the store and the residential area to cut noise and light pollution.
SNT.143490.16026	In December, Sunshine Coast Regional Council knocked backed the then-proposed store with mayor Bob Abbot expressing concern about its proximity to a residential area.
SNT.143490.16027	"I'm pretty sure I'm the only councillor who already has a 24-hour McDonald's in my division, we have enough issues with that one, and this is overkill," Councillor Chris Thompson, Division 4 in the Sunshine Coast Regional Council, had said about a 24 hour seven day a week store at Minyama.
SNT.143490.16028	The 24-hour McDonald's in Councillor Thompson's division, Mooloolaba, is part of a larger complex and does not back onto residential premises.
SNT.131244.16029	Yemeni government officials reported that Yemeni armed forces have killed over 100 Zaidi Shia rebel fighters following a battle to capture a town in the country's north.
SNT.131244.16030	In a statement, the government said that "the bodies of more than 100 rebels have been recovered from the roadside outside the town of Harf Sufyan."
SNT.131244.16031	"It seems that the bodies were those of rebels who were trying to flee the town during a mopping-up operation over the past two days."
SNT.131244.16032	The statement also said that two commanders, Mohsen Saleh Hadi Gawd and Salah Jorman, were identified among the dead.
SNT.131244.16033	The government statement said the Yemeni forces "totally [purged] the town of rebel elements in the past two days, forcing the rebels to surrender or flee."
SNT.131244.16034	The Zaidi insurgent group, also known as Houthis, have been fighting for northern independence for the past half decade.
SNT.131244.16035	Two weeks ago, the Yemeni government started Operation Scorched Earth to try to exterminate the insurgents.
SNT.131244.16036	Harf Sufyan is a town in Yemen's northern mountain range.
SNT.131244.16037	It is about seventy kilometres north of Sana'a, the country's capital.
SNT.48653.16038	A van carrying around thirty-three people crashed into the Alamatti reservoir on the Krishna river in north Karnataka, killing 25 people while the rest managed to swim to safety.
SNT.48653.16039	The passengers, including women and children, were from Bagsibundu village in Koppal district and were going to visit the Alamatti dam after going on a pilgrimage to Koodalasangama.
SNT.48653.16040	District officials rushed to the spot and initiated efforts to rescue survivors and extricate the bodies of the deceased.
SNT.48653.16041	Chief Minister of Karnataka, H.D Kumaraswamy expressed shock over the accident.
SNT.10522.16042	After a 3-1 victory in the 2nd game of the UEFA-Women's Cup final 2005 the players of the 1.FFC Turbine Potsdam have won the European championship against the Swedish team of Djurgården / Älvsjö - the UEFA Women's cup.
SNT.54370.16044	A 73-year old retired pastor, Reverend Roland Weisselberg, burned himself alive during Reformation Day services on Tuesday]in Erfurt, Germany.
SNT.54370.16045	His self-immolation was apparently in protest against the spread of Islam, which he felt the Protestant church should take more seriously.
SNT.54370.16046	His last words were "Jesus and Oskar,", believed to a reference to Oskar Bruesewitz, a priest who burned himself alive to protest the Communist government of East Germany.
SNT.54370.16047	He was transported to a burns unit in Halle but died en route.
SNT.54370.16048	Rev. Weisselberg had lived under Communism in East Germany, and had been a publisher in his former vocation.
SNT.54370.16049	Axel Noack, Bishop of Saxony, said that he was shocked at Rev. Weisselberg's self-immolation, stressing that Christians could not accept a "clash of cultures".
SNT.54370.16050	He confessed that the issue of Islam had been sidelined within the Church and was only spoken about in private.
SNT.54370.16051	There were few Muslims there with whom they could engage in dialogue, Noack said.
SNT.24278.16052	Following a dispute with London-based company Independent International Investment Research (IIIR), Internet company Google Inc. has dropped the use of its "Gmail" name for its free email service.
SNT.24278.16053	IIIR launched its own web-based email service called Gmail more than two years prior to Google's own service.
SNT.24278.16054	All other countries (except Germany, where a similar dispute also resulted in a name change) will continue to use the Gmail name and domain (gmail.com).
SNT.24278.16055	The change took place on Wednesday, when all new Gmail accounts created from a UK IP address will use the @googlemail.com domain, instead of the former @gmail.com.
SNT.24278.16056	As the service is still "invite-only", invitations for the service will also be made for the @googlemail.com domain.
SNT.24278.16057	Former UK Gmail users will continue to use the @gmail.com domain for the near future.
SNT.110328.16058	Two bombs detonated in the Güngören district of Istanbul, Turkey Sunday evening, killing at least 17 people and wounding over 150.
SNT.110328.16059	The neighborhood targeted is mainly residential, and the victims were civilians.
SNT.110328.16060	At least five of those killed were children, according to local officials.
SNT.110328.16061	This bombing was the worst terrorist attack in Istanbul since the 2003 Istanbul Bombings, in which truck bombs exploded outside two Istanbul synagogues, killing 23 and wounding more than 300.
SNT.110328.16062	The initial explosion caused little damage, but attracted crowds of onlookers.
SNT.110328.16063	The second more lethal blast occurred 10 minutes later, about 50 metres away.
SNT.110328.16064	"After the first explosion, I rushed outside to check on my two sons, found both of them."
SNT.110328.16065	"But my elder son insisted on going back to find his father," said Nimet Arslan to International Herald Tribune.
SNT.110328.16066	Following the second bomb, she said, "a dark smoke filled the air and all I could see or hear was people screaming."
SNT.110328.16067	Turkish President Abdullah Gül said in a statement, "Nothing can be achieved by terror, violently claiming lives of the innocent."
SNT.110328.16068	"These attacks show the inhumanity and misery of the assailants."
SNT.110328.16069	It is not yet clear who is responsible, but Turkish authorities suspect the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group.
SNT.110328.16070	"Of course, there are links with the separatist organization," the governor of Istanbul province, Muammer Güler said, "It's surely a terror attack, there’s no doubt."
SNT.110328.16071	This follows a recent shooting attack on the United States consulate in Istanbul.
SNT.110328.16072	On Sunday, the Turkish military announced that its fighter jets had raided twelve PKK settlements in Northern Iraq, which the PKK uses as a base to launch attacks on Turkey, raising speculation of PKK involvement in this attack.
SNT.110328.16073	However Zubeyir Aydar, a senior Kurdish militant, denied any involvement in the attacks in a statement to a pro-PKK news agency.
SNT.110328.16074	Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited the site on Monday, calling for calm and nationwide solidarity.
SNT.147889.16075	Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has announced a moratorium on executions, and will begin to seek their abolition.
SNT.147889.16076	On January 14, 2010, in a speech to parliament, Elbegdorj announced that he would pardon all persons sentenced to death, stating that most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty, and Mongolia should follow suit.
SNT.147889.16077	He also suggested that the death penalty be replaced with a 30 year prison sentence.
SNT.147889.16078	The decision was controversial: when Elbegdorj finished his speech, representatives of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party refused to join in the applause, which is customary after a presidential address to parliament.
SNT.147889.16079	Human rights groups welcomed the move, with Amnesty International expressing hope that Mongolia will vote in favour of an upcoming United Nations resolution calling for an end to Capital punishment.
SNT.147889.16080	It also urged other nations in the region to abolish the death penalty.
SNT.147889.16081	Many members of Mongolia's opposition-led parliament favour harsh punishments for criminals, and Elbegdorj must gain approval from parliament before the death penalty can be abolished.
SNT.147889.16082	If Elbegdorj fails to be re-elected, the new president could end the moratorium, and executions could resume.
SNT.144079.16083	Mozambique's main opposition party has rejected the results of last month's national elections, alleging fraud and ballot-stuffing.
SNT.144079.16084	Official results were released on Wednesday confirming that President Armando Guebuza had won another term in office.
SNT.144079.16085	The secretary-general of the opposition Renamo Party, Ussufo Momade, announced his party's rejection of the election results, saying there had been widespread fraud.
SNT.144079.16086	"We demand the cancellation of the results that were just announced and we insist on a new vote."
SNT.144079.16087	The National Electoral Commission said Wednesday that Guebuza had received more than 75% of the valid votes cast two weeks ago.
SNT.144079.16088	"The National Electoral Commission declares that Armando Emilio Guebuza has been elected president of the Republic of Mozambique for five years," the commission stated.
SNT.144079.16089	The president's Frelimo Party also won 191 of the 250 seats in parliament.
SNT.144079.16090	Before the elections, Frelimo had 160 seats and Renamo 90.
SNT.144079.16091	Frelimo has been in power since 1975, when Mozambique declared independence from Portugal.
SNT.144079.16092	Renamo's candidate, Afonso Dhlakama, received 16% of the vote, while the leader of a new party, Daviz Simango of the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), received 8%.
SNT.144079.16093	Sixteen other parties were also in contention for parliament seats, but none of them received more than one percent of the vote.
SNT.144079.16094	Frelimo, which has a two-thirds majority in the parliament, has a sufficient number of seats to alter the constitution without support from other parties.
SNT.144079.16095	There has been some speculation that Frelimo may use this to allow Guebuza to run for a third term - currently, the constitution allows a president to serve only two terms in office.
SNT.144079.16096	Senior Frelimo party members, however, promised that Guebuza had no intention of seeking another term.
SNT.144079.16097	"The majority in parliament will give us more freedom to choose what is best for Mozambican people."
SNT.144079.16098	"And that is what we will continue to do in the next mandate," said Frelimo election officer Veronica Macamo.
SNT.144079.16099	Soon after the election results were announced, Renamo alleged that there had been widespread ballot-stuffing in some districts, and that its observers had been expelled from others.
SNT.144079.16100	The MDM also protested, saying ballots had been tampered with at some stations, and produced a cell phone video showing election officials apparently tampering with ballots.
SNT.144079.16101	The party also made a list of alleged voting irregularities, which was given to media and election observers.
SNT.144079.16102	He also rejected the electoral body's verdict that the poll was credible.
SNT.144079.16103	"What the CNE is saying is what Frelimo tells them to say."
SNT.144079.16104	"But what the international community didn't know is that those polling station agents were actually recruited to stuff the ballot boxes."
SNT.144079.16105	"If that was not the case, why did they arrest most of our polling station watchers?"
SNT.144079.16105-1	"That is exactly to create the opportunity for them to do the stuffing," he said.
SNT.144079.16106	An observation consortium of religious and civic groups conducted a parallel tabulation of the vote in eight percent of the stations nationwide.
SNT.144079.16107	The group said there were indications of irregularities in six percent of the voting stations.
SNT.144079.16108	Voter turnout nationwide was 45%, but some stations reported a turnout of 95% or more, raising suspicions that there was ballot stuffing involved.
SNT.144079.16109	Other voting stations reported a turnout of 15% or less.
SNT.144079.16110	Many ballots were disqualified because they had a check-mark beside the face of one candidate, but a fingerprint beside the face of another.
SNT.144079.16111	Some observers concluded that such fraud might have affected the outcome in one of the contests for parliament, and several of those for the provincial assemblies.
SNT.144079.16112	Most international observers, however, had deemed the elections fair and free, although there had been some criticism that the electoral commission had disqualified MDM candidates for all but four provincial assemblies on technical grounds.
SNT.144079.16113	"The pre-election phase was characterized by peaceful, tolerant and yet enthusiastic political atmosphere."
SNT.144079.16114	"There was clear evidence of vigor and enthusiasm among political parties as they conducted their campaigns," said the South African Development Community (SADC), which sent 98 observers to oversee the elections.
SNT.144079.16115	The national elections commission stated that no official complaints of voting irregularity were submitted to them.
SNT.144079.16116	"Political parties have two days after the voting day to present complaints or proof of irregularities."
SNT.144079.16117	"We did not receive any complaints during this period," said the chairman of Mozambique's National Elections Commission, Leopoldo da Costa.
SNT.81387.16118	Bayern Munich's #1 goalkeeper Oliver Kahn striker Miroslav Klose have been ruled out of Thursday's UEFA Cup 1st Round 2nd Leg match against Portugal's Belenenses.

SNT.4050.16134	In an attempt at a world first twenty short-tailed bats are to be moved by the New Zealand Department of Conservation from the Tararua Ranges to Kapiti Island.
SNT.4050.16135	If the transfer to predator-free Kapiti works, it will become the first time that bats have ever been trans-located.
SNT.4050.16136	All previous attempts at moving bats have failed due to their natural homing instincts.
SNT.4050.16137	However scientists with the Department of Conservation, are aiming to overcome this by shifting juveniles.
SNT.4050.16138	Conservation Minister Chris Carter said that while the trial was risky, it was also worthwhile.
SNT.4050.16139	"A willingness to push boundaries and try new things is exactly what conservation in New Zealand needs," he said.

SNT.140895.16164	“I am convinced that what we are trying to do now with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania will not slow down the other three countries.
SNT.140895.16165	This was a political decision by all the member-states of the European community and that will not change,” said Tanja Fajon, the European Parliament Rapporteur on Visa Liberalization.
SNT.61305.16166	Microsoft decided to buy a health information search engine called Medstory.
SNT.61305.16167	This is the company's first step towards an involvement in the health market.
SNT.61305.16168	The software that Medstory develops involves artificial intelligence techniques which are applied to both medical and health information stored in medical journals, as well as government documents.
SNT.61305.16169	According to Peter Neupert, vice president for health strategy at Microsoft, the acquisition of Medstory represents the first step in assembling technologies which can serve well for the consumer experience in health care.
SNT.61305.16170	Microsoft decided to make its move into the health care system at a time when many websites, that provide various information on health, started to significantly raise their traffic and receive investments.
SNT.61305.16171	The industry analyst and Medstory investor, Esther Dyson, mentioned that the technology provided by Medstory is not just a search engine, it also represents an ontology engine.
SNT.61305.16172	He also outlined the fact that Microsoft has acquired "some of the best deep technology" in the fast growing field of medical search engines.
SNT.121781.16173	A collision between two United States military helicopters in Iraq that killed four last month has been blamed on enemy fire.
SNT.121781.16174	The two OH-58 Kiowa Warriors had been on a mission in Kirkuk when they were targeted and struck each other during evasive action, killing all those on board.
SNT.121781.16175	The anouncement on the involvement of hostile fire, which had previously been ruled out, was made at Fort Drum shortly after a memorial service for the two crews, who had been based there.
SNT.121781.16176	The Army said that forensic evidence revealed the presence of enemy fire.
SNT.121781.16177	"The two OH-58D helicopters were engaged and struck by hostile fire while conducting a reconnaissance mission," said a Fort Drum spokeswoman.
SNT.121781.16178	The Agence France-Presse was told that the investigation "determined that the two OH-58 helicopters involved in the January 25 incident [sic] in Kirkuk province were engaged and struck by hostile fire," and that "While executing evasive manoeuvres in response to the hostile fire, the two OH-58s collided, resulting in the catastrophic loss of both aircraft and crews," by a US Army spokesman for northern Iraq.
SNT.121781.16179	There is no indication as in to the precise nature of the attack.
SNT.121781.16180	Sunni nationalist extremist group Nakshabandiya had handed out leaflets after the attack saying they had shot the aircraft down and "would soon show a video," later repeating this claim on their website.
SNT.121781.16181	The group has ties to Saddam Hussein's fugitive deputy Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri.
SNT.121781.16182	The death toll was the highest for US soldiers in a single event for four months in Iraq.

SNT.120180.16186	Adelaide United came into the match with a win against Queensland Roar in the preliminary final.
SNT.120180.16187	The A-League uses the Page playoff system where the winner of the major semi final (1st vs. 2nd) qualifies for the grand final, while the loser plays the winner of the minor semi final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining place.
SNT.120180.16188	Melbourne midfielder Tom Pondeljak scored the only goal for the match with a long range strike on sixty minutes.

SNT.120180.16190	Melbourne was reduced to ten men twenty minutes from time when Danny Allsopp was sent off due to a late fracas.
SNT.120180.16191	Adelaide were great, they pushed us right to the death but I think we deserved it," Melbourne captain Kevin Muscat said.
SNT.120180.16192	"Down to 10 men it was a very difficult game for us but the amount of courage and heart the boys showed tonight to get through the game and keep fighting to the end was fantastic.
SNT.120180.16193	"It's one of those things I guess, it changed the game, but what can you do about it now?" Adelaide Captain Travis Dodd told Fox Sports after the match.
SNT.120180.16194	"We worked hard to keep it scoreless until half-time, to keep our discipline and keep our shape and keep doing what we were doing."
SNT.266402.16195	Online organisations around the world are today testing (IPv6) — a new system of Internet addresses hoped to resolve the issue of the present system being at capacity.
SNT.266402.16196	The current standard was set up in the 1980s; it gives everything on the Internet a twelve-digit address and allows for 4.3 billion combinations.
SNT.266402.16197	With these exhausted, IPv6 is designed to increase the limit 340 undecillion — that's 340 trillion trillion trillion.
SNT.266402.16198	Major websites including services run by Google, Facebook, and Yahoo! are taking part in the test, switching their content to use the new system.
SNT.266402.16199	Facebook predicts 99.97% of users to be unaffected and Google anticipates 99.5% will not encounter problems.
SNT.266402.16200	Fiji and Australia are among the first countries to have business-hours web traffic during the test.
SNT.266402.16201	Internet Society of Australia President Tony Hill claims more than 100 global companies are involved.
SNT.62929.16202	The Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane, was set to land in the United States of America on Monday after a test flight.
SNT.62929.16203	One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people.
SNT.62929.16204	It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers, though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa.
SNT.62929.16205	A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on Monday, but without passengers.
SNT.62929.16206	This will be branded as a Qantas flight and fly from Frankfurt to Los Angeles LAX airport.
SNT.62929.16207	The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number, and is due to arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 12:30 EST (16:30 UTC).
SNT.62929.16208	The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work.
SNT.62929.16209	Deliveries to Singapore Airlines, its launch customer, are not due until October - two years late.
SNT.62929.16210	Delays of the production of the A380 have cost Airbus more than 6 billion dollars.
SNT.62929.16211	Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come.
SNT.62929.16212	These monetary problems have led to a recently-announced restructuring program at Airbus, called Power8, in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners.
SNT.62929.16213	France will lose 4,300 jobs, followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs, while the United Kingdom and Spain will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively.
SNT.62929.16214	The Belgian government has announced that it will give up to 150 million € (US$ 199 million) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers.
SNT.309449.16215	The UK's Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) announced today a grant of £4.6 million towards the restoration of Lews Castle on the Western Scottish island of Stornoway.
SNT.309449.16216	Estimates suggest approximately £14 million (US$ 21.9m, € 16.2m) will be spent to restore and convert the Victorian era property into a museum with four-star hotel accommodation.
SNT.309449.16217	Originally built as a home for James Matheson, who made his fortune in the Chinese and Indian opium trade, the castle has lain empty, and on the at-risk register, since the late 1980s.
SNT.309449.16218	A gap of £1.6 million in required funding remains a concern the local Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (previously, Western Isles Council) is actively seeking help from both Europe and the Scottish government.
SNT.309449.16219	Council leader Angus Campbell intends to press the Scottish Government on the final funding; "it would be a huge shame if all the other funding is lost", he said.
SNT.309449.16220	"We are optimistic about getting some European funding, which is absolutely crucial, and are asking the Scottish Government to close the funding gap."
SNT.309449.16221	Campbell describes what would be the first UK museum with Gaelic as its primary language as "a generational project" with benefits throughout the communities of the Outer Hebrides.
SNT.309449.16222	Local MSP Alasdair Allan commended the council's efforts to save Lews Castle saying they, and other agencies, "have been working tirelessly to progress plans that would ensure Lews Castle becomes both a cultural and economic asset to the islands."
SNT.309449.16223	Throughout its colourful history, the castle was at one time owned by William Lever who founded Unilever.
SNT.309449.16224	Before gifting the castle to the local people in 1923, Lord Leverhulme invested in electric lighting, central heating, an internal telephone system, and the extension of the ballroom for social gatherings.
SNT.309449.16225	In World War II, the castle was the base for a Naval hospital and squadron of amphibious biplanes.
SNT.309449.16226	Post-war, it spent 30 years as a technical college and school.
SNT.309449.16227	If the final tranche of funding is secured, in 2014 the castle will become the first-ever archive facility in the Western Isles.
SNT.309449.16228	The collections of Museum nan Eilean (MnE) could move from their current home into the castle; items held by the National Archives of Scotland could return to their native isles.
SNT.309449.16229	And, modern facilities would permit collections from the National Museum of Scotland and the British Museum – such as the Lewis Chessmen – to be exhibited there.
SNT.143693.16230	A NATO airstrike has killed at least seven members of the Afghan security forces in the western province of Badghis on Friday, according to the Afghan defence ministry.
SNT.143693.16231	"Due to a NATO forces air strike on November 6 in Badghis province seven Afghan security personnel (both Afghan army and national police) were martyred and also some were wounded," the ministry stated.
SNT.143693.16232	NATO and Afghan authorities are investigating but NATO officials have yet to comment.
SNT.143693.16233	Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman, Gen Mohammad Zahir Azimi, said that the airstrike hit a base housing NATO and Afghan troops.
SNT.143693.16234	The announcement comes amidst Friday's investigation in Badghis, where more than 25 joint troops sustained injuries whilst searching for two missing United States paratroopers.
SNT.143693.16235	According to an anonymous Western military official they were injured by friendly fire.
SNT.101395.16236	A politician from Spain's ruling Socialist Party has been killed in Spain's northern Basque region, in the town of Mondragon.
SNT.101395.16237	The shooting came just two days before general elections in Spain.
SNT.101395.16238	Isaías Carrasco, 42, was shot outside his house in front of his wife and daughter and was taken to hospital, where he died of his wounds.
SNT.101395.16239	No group has claimed the attack but Spanish sources said the attack was probably carried out by the Basque separatist group, considered as a terrorist group by European Union and United States, ETA.
SNT.101395.16240	Spain is in the final day of official campaigning ahead of Sunday's general election, in which the Socialist prime minister Rodriguez Zapatero is seeking a second term.
SNT.101395.16241	The conservative opposition Partido Popular has focused his campaign in the terrorism and separatism, especially that of the Basque.
SNT.101395.16242	After the shooting the main parties announced a halt to campaigning.
SNT.101395.16243	According to the polls, the two parties are neck and neck in the race for the election.
SNT.164127.16244	According to local media, 25 people have died in an illegal coal mine in central China, after a fire broke out there.
SNT.164127.16245	The incident occurred at the mines of the Dongxing Coal Mining Company, near the city of Zhengzhou, the capital of the Henan province.
SNT.164127.16246	It is believed that the fire was started by an electrical fault, the Xinhua news agency reports.
SNT.164127.16247	There were 31 total miners inside the mine; six were able to escape, but the others burnt to death.
SNT.164127.16248	The owner, manager, and an investor of the mine were taken into police custody on Monday.
SNT.164127.16249	Their assets, and those of the mine, have been frozen by the authorities.
SNT.164127.16250	It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze, although an investigation is underway.
SNT.164127.16251	China's mines are the deadliest in the world; according to Al Jazeera, several thousand miners die each year due to accidents in them.
SNT.164127.16252	Earlier this month, over 30 people were killed in another coal mine in the northern part of the country, after a flood.
SNT.164127.16253	The government has pledged to crack down upon illegal mines and enforce safety rules.
SNT.414381.16254	China has joined other members of the United Nations Security Council in openly warning North Korea against future provocations and took several diplomatic measures on Tuesday and Wednesday.
SNT.414381.16255	China's foreign ministry released a statement Wednesday that urged a return to talks: "We believe that maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is in the interest of all parties ...
SNT.414381.16256	The statement came after North Korea's announcement Tuesday that it would no longer honor the testing agreements that have been made with the United States.
SNT.414381.16257	The United States halted its food aid, which had been part of the agreements, after Friday's failed launch.
SNT.414381.16258	Also on Tuesday, China delivered another stern warning to the nation through its party newspaper Global Times.
SNT.414381.16259	In the statement, China expressed impatience with its neighbor and said China's foreign policy toward North Korea would not be hijacked by North Korea's leaders.
SNT.414381.16260	Behind the scenes, China has ceased the repatriation of North Korean nationals on Chinese territory.
SNT.414381.16261	Diplomatic pressure on North Korea continued this week as the country remained defiant during its celebration Sunday.
SNT.414381.16262	Kim Jong-un gave his first formal address on Sunday in the aftermath of Friday's failed attempt to launch a multistage rocket into orbit and in honor of the anniversary of Kim Il-sung's 100th birthday.
SNT.414381.16263	North Korea publicly acknowledged that its rocket broke up in flight and over ocean waters before ever taking orbit Friday morning.
SNT.414381.16264	The United Nations criticized North Korea over the weekend for a satellite launch that member states saw as a "provocative" move, which followed shortly after the country's launch.
SNT.414381.16265	UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the attempt "deplorable" and said it "threatens regional stability."
SNT.414381.16266	Corinne Momal-Vanian, UN spokesperson, said, "The Secretary-General urges the (North Korean government) not to undertake any further provocative actions that will heighten tension in the region."
SNT.414381.16267	The UN Security Council met in a closed session Friday.
SNT.414381.16268	Susan Rice, who is both the current UN Security Council president and US ambassador to the United Nations, said, "The United States' view of this is quite clear, we have condemned the launch.
SNT.414381.16269	We view it as a direct violation of resolution 1718 and 1874.
SNT.414381.16270	We think it’s important that the Council respond credibly and we will be working in that direction."
SNT.414381.16271	While China is being openly critical of North Korea, it has a veto right on the UN Security Council that has prevented further sanctions.
SNT.414381.16272	US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said China stood with other member nations of the Security Council in penalizing North Korea for future actions.
SNT.414381.16273	In a nation where speeches by leaders are rare, the young North Korean leader on Sunday said, "Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists."
SNT.414381.16274	The public event finished with the display of a new rocket and it further punctuated Kim Jong-un's call for making the military the nation's number one priority.
SNT.106785.16275	Google, the owners of YouTube, claimed in a court briefing today that the one billion dollar lawsuit against the company "threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information."
SNT.106785.16276	Viacom Inc. is suing Google over 150,000 videos, for which Viacom owns the copyright, that were allegedly being shown on YouTube.
SNT.106785.16277	Google has responded by saying that they followed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prevents companies from being prosecuted if they bring down copyrighted content as soon as they are made aware of it.
SNT.106785.16278	"Viacom’s lawsuit challenges the protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that Congress enacted a decade ago to encourage the development of services like YouTube," said Google.
SNT.106785.16279	"Congress recognized that such services could not and would not exist if they faced liability for copyright infringement based on materials users uploaded to their services.
SNT.106785.16280	It chose to immunize these services from copyright liability provided they are properly responsive to notices of alleged infringement from content owners."
SNT.106785.16281	"Looking at the online world today, there is no question that Congress made the correct policy choice," Google continued.
SNT.106785.16282	"Legitimate services like YouTube provide the world with free and authorized access to extraordinary libraries of information that would not be available without the DMCA -- information created by users who have every right to share it."
SNT.106785.16283	Google then claimed that "YouTube also fulfills its end of the DMCA bargain, and indeed goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works."
SNT.56454.16284	American politician of the Democratic party Dennis Kucinich plans to run for president in 2008 the five-term congressman's spokesman, Andy Juniewicz, said Monday.
SNT.56454.16285	Kucinich ran in 2004 and was last in nearly every primary and caucus of that year.
SNT.56454.16286	Kucinich began his political career as a Cleveland city councilman and later as the youngest person ever elected mayor of the Midwestern city.
SNT.56454.16287	The congressman made his decision to run, according to a written statement, because he felt his own party's leadership was not aggressive enough in opposing the Iraq war.
SNT.56454.16288	Kucinich, 60, is a staunch opponent of the Iraq war.
SNT.56454.16289	He has advocated cutting off funds for the war, saying that voting for money to maintain or expand the war is incompatible with a position of opposition to it.
SNT.56454.16290	He also co-chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus and is a self-described "Wellstone Democrat."
SNT.56454.16291	He has been praised as "a genuine progressive" by a Ralph Nader and in 2003, Kucinich was the recipient of the Gandhi Peace Award.
SNT.56454.16292	If elected, he would be the country's first vegan president.
SNT.36310.16293	Estonian and Finnish oil spill response vessels are working on cleaning up the oil spill caused by the sinking of the Runner 4.
SNT.36310.16294	The Dominican-registered ship sank on March 6 near the Estonian coast in the Gulf of Finland.
SNT.36310.16295	This oil disaster may be even worse than the one of February, which was described by the BBC as the worst oil spill that Estonia has ever experienced.
SNT.36310.16296	According to The Baltic Times, specialists say that this time up to 40 tons of oil might have leaked into the sea from the Runner 4.
SNT.36310.16297	The ship was carrying, according to MTV3, over 100 tons of heavy fuel oil and 35 tons of light fuel oil.
SNT.36310.16298	The ship Runner 4 sank due to a collision with another ship, in a convoy following a Russian icebreaker.
SNT.36310.16299	The crew managed to leave the ship before it sank.
SNT.36310.16300	He says, according to Finland's national broadcasting company (YLE), that the countermeasures should have started a week ago, immediately after the disaster, instead of now.
SNT.36310.16301	He said, "It's difficult now to get the oil under control.
SNT.36310.16302	It's spread all around, and ship traffic is spreading it further.
SNT.36310.16303	Finland will be paying the costs of the cleanup, as Estonia did not make an official request for help.
SNT.36310.16304	The Estonian Border Guard's representative Helena Loorents says that Finland was not asked for help, as every day spent in the cleaning costs a lot of money.
SNT.36310.16305	According to Urmas Raudsepp, the director of Estonia's Institute of Marine Research, the oil spill's location was only found out on Thursday March 16.
SNT.36310.16306	The Finnish ships had, however, arrived at the site on the day before.
SNT.36310.16307	The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining.
SNT.36310.16308	The oil spill is moving into waters too shallow for the three Finnish vessels, so they can no longer do their job.
SNT.36310.16309	Hylje will be heading back to Finland on March 19 and the other two might follow within a few days.
SNT.36310.16310	According to the Estonian paper Postimees, the oil spill is now a kilometer (0.6 mile) away from the Estonian capital of Tallinn.
SNT.20501.16311	The U.S. House Committee on International Relations voted Wednesday on a Resolution of Inquiry that would have required the White House and State Department to "transmit all information relating to communication with officials of the United Kingdom between January 1, 2002, and October 16, 2002, relating to the policy of the United States with respect to Iraq."
SNT.20501.16312	The resolution comes in response to questions that have been raised by senior intelligence officials and information revealed in leaked U.K. documents such as the Downing Street Memo, regarding the handling of pre-war intelligence by the Bush administration, and the planning and execution of the Iraq war.
SNT.20501.16313	Originally proposed by Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), the Resolution of Inquiry had 83 co-sponsors at the time of voting, including one Republican member of the International Relations Committee, Jim Leach, who was the only Republican voting in favor of the resolution.
SNT.20501.16314	Some members of the committee from each party were absent.
SNT.91437.16315	Around 1927, one of his teachers, Alfonso Caso, encouraged what will be the start of his career; he suggested Henestrosa to write the same zapotec myths, legends, and fables, the base of his first book Los Hombres Que Dispersó La Danza, published in 1929.
SNT.91437.16316	In addition to his prose and poetry, Henestrosa served in the federal legislature and was a Senator from the state of Oaxaca from 1982 to 1988.
SNT.148739.16317	The British Broadcasting Corporation made the announcement that he had died at 1030 GMT in Hawick, in the Scottish Borders — his chosen home town.
SNT.148739.16318	McLaren started rugby commentating on a BBC radio station in 1953 while he was a reporter with the Hawick Express, a newspaper.
SNT.148739.16319	He was awarded an MBE, an OBE and a CBE and retired in 2002.
SNT.148739.16320	People have now paid tribute to the man who became known as the "voice of rugby".
SNT.148739.16321	In a video shown on BBC News Online, HRH The Princess Royal can be quoted as saying that "[e]ven if you didn't think that you understood anything about rugby, somehow Bill McLaren gave you the confidence to listen to what he was saying.
SNT.148739.16322	Gavin Hastings, who was the former rugby captain for Scotland, said that "[f]irst and foremost, Bill was a very proud and passionate Scot but such was his professionalism that you would never really have known that.
SNT.148739.16323	He always remained very unbiased in his commentary and I think that that was unquestionably one of his endearing qualities.
SNT.148739.16324	He was a wonderful commentator and he just brought the world of rugby into so many people's homes."
SNT.148739.16325	John Thorbun, who is the secretary for Hawick Rugby Club, stated: "We're devastated, obviously — we've got a room named after him at the rugby club.
SNT.148739.16326	It was very close to his heart, Hawick Rugby Club.
SNT.196063.16327	After an investigation, Wikinews has learned that oil spewing from a rupture in the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico on June 13 was 50 to 60 feet from the Deepwater Horizon leak.
SNT.196063.16328	A nearly four and a half minute video posted on YouTube on June 13 was from the Viking Poseidon ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) 1.
SNT.196063.16329	It shows oil and methane leaking from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m. on June 13.
SNT.196063.16330	The ROV monitors the leak for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot.
SNT.196063.16331	Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled, making the leak locations vary from 50 to 60 feet from the damaged well.
SNT.196063.16332	Until now, there was no way to determine the location of the ROVs in relation to the previously leaking Deepwater Horizon well.
SNT.196063.16333	Alexander Higgins, an independent computer programmer, developed the 'Gulf Oil Spill ROV UTM Distance Calculator.'
SNT.196063.16334	Higgins told Wikinews how he created the calculator, and says it is "very accurate," but that the tool would "not give you accurate measurements over a large distance, e.g. from the well head to New Orleans."
SNT.196063.16335	BP, who owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon, has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor.
SNT.196063.16336	Seismic tests were conducted on July 16; Admiral Thad Allen of the United States Coast Guard said that "no anomalies" were found, but also that the tests were "not comprehensive."
SNT.196063.16337	On Sunday, Wikinews contacted BP, who authenticated the video, and asked if any ROVs were sent back to the crack and leak location on June 13 for further investigation.
SNT.196063.16338	According to their office in London, England, they "sent ROVs to investigate and monitor that and no further signs of oil or gas were found."
SNT.196063.16339	They also stated that they "have continued to monitor" and "have also carried out seismic surveys.
SNT.196063.16340	Wikinews also asked if they could confirm the location of the leak and crack, but no response was given.
SNT.196063.16341	However, on July 18, the Associated Press reported that there was "seepage" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head.
SNT.196063.16342	For the past two days, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well.
SNT.196063.16343	BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted.
SNT.196063.16344	"If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is."
SNT.196063.16345	Since the June 13 video surfaced, other videos have been posted to YouTube allegedly showing some of the ROVs being tossed around by large amounts of oil seeping through the seafloor.
SNT.196063.16346	One video showed an alleged eruption spraying oil and debris around the BOA DEEP C 2 ROV before it was tossed from side to side.
SNT.196063.16347	Some of the cracks on ocean floors, where oil has leaked from, have occurred naturally.
SNT.196063.16348	One such oil spill in California in 2005 was the result of a naturally occurring crack in the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
SNT.196063.16349	Some of those cracks can cause oil to leak through at a rate as high as 5,000 gallons a day, with most of the oil not even reaching the water's surface.
SNT.196063.16350	In the Gulf of Mexico, oil leaks through natural cracks at a rate several times less than leaked from the Deepwater well.
SNT.196063.16351	"The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico.
SNT.196063.16352	By May 30, the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil, compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period," said Cutler Cleveland, a Boston University professor at the university's Department of Geography and Environment.
SNT.196063.16353	The Deepwater Horizon oil spill started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig.
SNT.196063.16354	Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf.
SNT.196063.16355	On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf.
SNT.196063.16356	BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf.
SNT.196063.16357	The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap for 48 hours.
SNT.196063.16358	Earlier on July 17, they announced the test would continue for another day.
SNT.196063.16359	BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI.
SNT.196063.16360	As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI.
SNT.196063.16361	BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.
SNT.196063.16362	We will keep monitoring and make the decisions as we go forward.
SNT.196063.16363	The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it," said Allen.
SNT.58381.16364	Canon Inc. announced the initiative to start production of new generation flat-panel television on its own.
SNT.58381.16365	The sole production will occur after Canon Inc. buys the stake of Toshiba Corp. in their joint venture, SED Inc.
SNT.58381.16366	The companies are expected to make an official statement concerning their joint venture.
SNT.58381.16367	In order to start production of the new flat-screens based on the SED technology, Canon Inc. had to clarify the situation with the Texas-based Nano-Proprietary Inc.
SNT.58381.16368	The latter has brought a lawsuit against Canon in 2005 on the basis of the two sided agreement concerning the patent on SED technology.
SNT.58381.16369	The agreement didn't allow Canon to make any other ventures on this technology, but Canon joining forces with Toshiba was the reason for the mentioned lawsuit.
SNT.58381.16370	The dispute with Nano-Proprietary was the ground for Canon and Toshiba to delay the construction of the $1.7 billion plant for SED-based flat-panels.
SNT.58381.16371	Earlier the companies agreed to contribute with 100 billion yen each in the SED plant.
SNT.58381.16372	Toshiba's stake in the joint venture SED Inc. is about Yen$10 billion, or, approximately, US$83 million.
SNT.58381.16373	This new SED (surface-conduction electron-emitter display) technology is meant to replace the existing LCD and plasma screen due to their smaller sizes and lower energy consumption.
SNT.58381.16374	At the end of this year the companies planned to start mass production of these new displays.
SNT.6759.16375-1	Did we need to take a poll to find out how well America sleeps at night? 
SNT.6759.16375-2	Probably not, but the results of the poll offer a worrisome picture about our problems getting a good night’s sleep.
SNT.6759.16376	The National Sleep Foundation, the poll sponsor, reports three-quarters of adults say they frequently have a sleep problem, such as waking during the night or snoring.
SNT.6759.16377	The average adult gets less than the recommended seven to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep each night.
SNT.6759.16378	This leads to poorer health, lower productivity on the job, more danger on the roads and a less vibrant sex life.
SNT.6759.16379	One-fourth admit their sleep problems do have an impact on their daily lives.
SNT.6759.16380	Becky Mcerien, 50, in Philadelphia, told a reporter "By 3 to 4 in the afternoon, I'm starting to feel brain-drained and I need that caffeine to pick me back up again,"
SNT.6759.16381	But Guillermo Sardina, 55, of Hamilton, N.J., said "I sleep through the night.
SNT.6759.16382	Darwin McCallian, 51, of Burke, Va., rises at 4 a.m. to get a jump on traffic for his commute to Washington, DC.
SNT.6759.16383	"When I sleep in a little bit longer, it makes me a safer driver," McCallian noted.
SNT.6759.16384	They recommend avoiding alcohol and caffeine close to bedtime, and that adults pay attention to how much sleep they get as well as the quality of that sleep, and seek help if needed.
SNT.106705.16385	A video has surfaced online that appears to show at least two Russian missiles flying out of control after the Lodeynoe Pole air force base caught fire in St Petersburg on May 23.
SNT.106705.16386	The video, which was broadcast by BBC News is about 45 seconds long and shows at least two out of control missiles being launched from within the base as the fire rages on and landing nearby.
SNT.106705.16387	No one was killed or injured when the missiles were set off, but witnesses report that several missiles "were flying over" their heads as they watched the blaze.
SNT.106705.16388	According to unnamed police officials investigating the fire, at least 400 to 450 air-to-air missiles were damaged or destroyed in the fire.
SNT.106705.16389	Officials estimate that the cost of the damage could exceed 80 to 100 million United States dollars.
SNT.106705.16390	We have yet to establish how many of them exploded and how many were damaged by fire, but in any case they can't be used," said an unnamed Russian official as quoted by the International Herald Tribune which quoted Interfax.
SNT.106705.16391	The base housed missiles and Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet planes.
SNT.500861.16392	Yesterday, in front of the USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Virginia, presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney selected Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate.
SNT.500861.16393	After an introduction from Virginia governor Bob McDonnell, who himself had been considered a potential running mate, Romney officially made the announcement.
SNT.500861.16394	He referred to Ryan as "an intellectual leader of the Republican Party" and initially labeled Ryan as the "next president of the United States" before correcting himself after Ryan reached the podium.
SNT.500861.16395	Ryan, 42, has represented Wisconsin's 1st congressional district since 1999 and serves as chairman of the House Budget Committee.
SNT.500861.16396	Last year, he authored the budget proposal, The Path to Prosperity, which promotes reductions in federal spending of $6.2 trillion from the Obama plan through a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a reformation of Medicare, and capping of federal discretionary spending.
SNT.500861.16397	During his acceptance speech, Ryan said that his "record of getting things done in Congress will be a very helpful complement to Governor Romney's executive and private sector success outside of Washington."
SNT.500861.16398	He added that the campaign "won't duck the tough issues—we will lead" and went after the record of President Barack Obama, arguing that his policies "didn't make things better."
SNT.500861.16399	On the announcement, senior Obama staffers explained that Ryan's selection "makes clear that Romney would be a rubber stamp for the congressional GOP" and that the choice provides the Obama campaign with "clear advantages".
SNT.500861.16400	According to Reuters, Romney made the decision on August 1 after returning from his international trip.
SNT.500861.16401	Four days later, Ryan was secretly flown to Brookline, Massachusetts to meet Romney at the home of Beth Myers, who was running the vice presidential search.
SNT.500861.16402	Ryan was supposed to be announced on Friday in New Hampshire, but he had to return to Wisconsin to attend a memorial for victims of the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting.
SNT.500861.16403	Thereafter, the campaign decided to make the announcement in Virginia, and so Ryan was once again secretly flown, this time to Elizabeth City, North Carolina near Norfolk, where he met with Romney and prepared his acceptance speech.
SNT.500861.16404	NBC News first announced the decision, and the Romney campaign announced the news to supporters through a phone application at seven a.m., a couple of hours before the official announcement.
SNT.35960.16405	NASA has announced that the Cassini spacecraft has found what seem to be geysers spewing water on the moon Enceladus.
SNT.35960.16406	The find raises the possibility of life on other planets, as liquid water is believed to be a requirement for life.
SNT.35960.16407	"This marks the first time that scientists have seen evidence of water in liquid form so close to the surface on another body beyond Earth," said Cassini scientist Torrence Johnson.
SNT.35960.16408	Although life may be found on the moon, most scientists concede that if Enceladus does harbor life, it probably consists of microbes or other robust organisms capable of living in extreme conditions.
SNT.35960.16409	This latest discovery shows that life in other parts of the universe may be more probable than previously thought.
SNT.35960.16410	"We realize that this is a radical conclusion — that we may have evidence for liquid water within a body so small and so cold," said Dr. Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colorado.
SNT.35960.16411	"However, if we are right, we have significantly broadened the diversity of solar system environments where we might possibly have conditions suitable for living organisms."
SNT.783340.16412	Irish budget airline Ryanair have dismissed pilot John Goss, who has worked with the airline for 25 years, over remarks he made in a documentary about safety at the airline.
SNT.783340.16413	Ryanair issued a statement confirming legal proceedings have been begun against Goss.
SNT.783340.16414	The airline is already suing the UK's Channel 4 over Monday night's broadcast of Secrets of the Cockpit, part of the Dispatches series, in which Goss appeared.
SNT.783340.16415	The programme discussed the airline's safety with a focus on fuel policy, investigating allegations Ryanair uses a bare minimum of fuel and intimidates pilots who raise concerns.
SNT.783340.16416	Goss, who had been due to retire in October, is a key figure of Ryanair Pilots Group (RPG), which conducted a survey of more than 1,000 flight crew.
SNT.783340.16417	According to the RPG survey almost 90% of respondents said the safety culture was nontransparent.
SNT.783340.16418	Ryanair had told pilots anybody signing a "so-called safety petition" might be dismissed.
SNT.783340.16419	Pilots interviewed for the programme said they felt pressured to save fuel, the cost of which has hit Ryanair's profits.
SNT.783340.16420	Following an incident in Spain in which three Ryanair flights declared fuel emergencies after being diverted to Valencia the Spanish Air Authority described Ryanair flights usually landing with a bare minimum of fuel, in a report the airline dismissed as "manifestly inaccurate and factually untrue".
SNT.783340.16421	One anonymous pilot interviewed by Channel 4 accused the airline of "threats and bullying".
SNT.783340.16422	Over 90% of those surveyed wanted a regulatory inquiry, with RPG saying the survey results were passed to the airline and the Irish Aviation Authority.
SNT.783340.16423	RPG is not recognised by the airline which calls the group "[lacking] any independence, objectivity or reliability" and a union front.
SNT.783340.16424	The other pilots interviewed by Channel 4 chose to remain anonymous, with only Goss identifying himself.
SNT.783340.16425	The airline says RPG only conducted their survey to unionise Ryanair pilots and issued a statement describing the documentary as "based on nothing more than anonymous hearsay claims made by individuals whose identity was concealed, and/or by representatives of pilot unions of Ryanair's competitor airlines masquerading as a non-Ryanair Pilot Group".
SNT.783340.16426	Ryanair claim Goss wrote to the airline saying he had no concerns about safety, stating "We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national television just three weeks after he confirmed in writing to Ryanair that he had no concerns with safety and no reason to make any confidential safety report".
SNT.783340.16427	The airline further say they "look forward to correcting Mr Goss's defamatory claims in court".
SNT.783340.16428	Channel 4 have previously stated an intent to defend the legal action against them.
SNT.51769.16429	The UN Security Council will "mostly likely" adopt a non-binding statement later today on North Korea's announcement of planned nuclear bomb tests; the statement does not explicitly mention the threat of sanctions.
SNT.51769.16430	This was announced by the Security Council president late yesterday.
SNT.51769.16431	Japan's UN envoy Kenzo Oshima, who chairs the 15-member body this month, said council experts made "good progress" in efforts to fine tune a Japanese draft, but said they had yet to finalize it.
SNT.51769.16432	"Most likely we will have something adopted (Friday)" once council members consult their respective capitals for "final clearance," he added.
SNT.51769.16433	Earlier on Thursday, Japan and the United States pushed for a threat to resort to mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
SNT.51769.16434	China and Russia (two veto members of the Council) however, voted against the sanctions.
SNT.51769.16435	It is hoped that the latest text will urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear tests and return back to six-party talks "without precondition".
SNT.51769.16436	North Korea had earlier boycotted the talks in response to a sanction placed by the US on one of its banks, believed to linked to the regime of Kim Jong-Il.
SNT.51769.16437	North Korea claims it has nuclear weapons, although this has not yet been independently verified.
SNT.100309.16438	Political activist Ralph Nader has announced the launch of an independent campaign for President of the United States.
SNT.100309.16439	Nader, who also ran for president in the previous three elections, made the announcement on NBC's television program Meet the Press.
SNT.100309.16440	"Dissent is the mother of ascent, and in that context I have decided to run for president," said Nader.
SNT.100309.16441	"In the last few years, big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevent us from trying to improve our country.
SNT.100309.16442	And I want everybody to have the right and opportunity to improve their country."
SNT.100309.16443	In 2000, Nader ran for President as a Green Party candidate and received 2.7% of the popular vote.
SNT.100309.16444	Many Democrats believe his campaign led to the election of Republican George W. Bush by taking away potential votes for Democrat Al Gore, especially in the state of Florida.
SNT.100309.16445	Nader also ran in 2004 as an independent, but only garnered 0.4% of the vote.
SNT.100309.16446	At a press conference yesterday, Democratic candidate Barack Obama doubted that a potential Nader candidacy would have the same impact as in 2000.
SNT.100309.16447	"I think the job of the Democratic Party is to be so compelling that a few percentage of the vote going to another candidate's not going to make any difference," he said.
SNT.100309.16448	"He thought that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush and, eight years later, I think people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about," Obama told reporters.
SNT.100309.16449	"Obviously it’s not helpful to whoever our Democratic nominee is," she said.
SNT.100309.16450	"I remember when he did this before, it didn't turn out too well for anyone, especially our country."
SNT.100309.16451	She said Nader "prevented Al Gore from being the 'greenest' president we could have had", and she hoped his bid will be "just a passing fancy that people won't take too seriously."
SNT.100309.16452	Nader dismissed criticism of his entry into the race, saying, "For anybody who thinks that the third try is something that should be demeaned, it represents persistence, it represents never giving up the struggle for justice."
SNT.100309.16453	Meanwhile, Republican candidate Mike Huckabee welcomed Nader into the race, in the hopes that he will lessen the Democratic voter base.
SNT.100309.16454	"I think it would always pull votes away from the Democrats, not the Republicans," he said.
SNT.100309.16455	"So actually, Republicans would welcome his entry into the race and hope that a few more will join in."
SNT.26855.16456	A vote of no-confidence, to be held on Monday, is expected to signal an end to the current Canadian government.
SNT.26855.16457	The vote is to be held at 6:30PM local time in Ottawa, Ontario.
SNT.26855.16458	The no-confidence vote against Paul Martin's government was introduced by three of the opposition parties last week.
SNT.26855.16459	The actual motion was proposed by Conservative party leader, Stephen Harper.
SNT.145758.16460	Indonesia's High Court in Yogyakarta has overturned the April conviction of a Garuda Indonesia pilot who was behind the controls in an air disaster.
SNT.145758.16461	Captain Marwoto Komar was cleared of negligently causing the deaths of 21 when his Boeing 737 overshot the runway at Adisucipto Airport.
SNT.145758.16462	The March 2007 crash occurred after the flight from Jakarta landed at excessive speed and a steep angle.
SNT.145758.16463	The jet bounced down the runway before overshooting and coming to rest in a rice field, where it was destroyed by fire.
SNT.145758.16464	Of the 140 on board, sixteen Indonesians and five Australians were killed.
SNT.145758.16465	The court in Komar's trial had ruled that while it could not be shown for sure that the aircraft was mechanically sound with the Captain solely responsible for the dangerous landing, Komar had two minutes in which to inform air traffic control and his co-pilot Gagam Salman R. that they were experiencing an emergency.
SNT.145758.16466	The court found that had he done so Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting equipment could have been mobilised ready for the incoming jet.
SNT.145758.16467	The investigation by the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) found no mechanical defect and stated that fifteen activations of the Ground proximity warning system had been ignored, but international law made this inadmissible as evidence.
SNT.145758.16468	The ruling was overturned in September, but has only just been published.
SNT.145758.16469	The High Court ruled that the prosecution had failed to "legally and convincingly" demonstrate guilt and therefore "the defendant's rights, position and status should be restored."
SNT.145758.16470	Komar received half of the four year sentence sought by prosecutors but avoided jail as he was freed on bail while the appeal was pending.
SNT.145758.16471	Komar's lawyer Mochtar Zuhdi said the High Court decision was final and cannot be appealed.
SNT.145758.16472	The decision to charge Captain Komar was highly controversial; the first time Indonesia prosecuted a pilot over a crash.
SNT.145758.16473	Indonesia Air Traffic Controllers Association chief Adrie Gunawan said that 26 controllers left the country fearing possible prosecutions if anything went wrong on their shift; they also threatened to strike.
SNT.145758.16474	Indonesian Pilots' Association chief Manotar Napitupulu said "This shows that the justice system has finally understood that Marwoto’s case did not belong in court."
SNT.145758.16475	Last year Wikinews interviewed Paul McCarthy, an aviation lawyer and pilot who serves as the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations' representative to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
SNT.145758.16476	McCarthy said that prosecuting the man could have a chilling effect on people speaking to accident investigators, hence affecting safety.
SNT.145758.16477	Victims' families in Australia are upset and angry at the decision.
SNT.145758.16478	The Sydney Morning Herald used a headline that stated "Ruling denies justice for Australian crash victims".
SNT.145758.16479	"The fact he has had his conviction quashed and pilot status reinstated, it's like nothing's happened," said Caroline Mellish, whose brother Morgan was killed.
SNT.145758.16480	Simone Kerr, who lost her sister in the disaster, said "My greatest fear is that he will be flying again."
SNT.77596.16481	Mahatma Gandhi's grandson, Arun Manilal Gandhi, was interviewed by Peter Sissons on behalf of BBC News 24.
SNT.77596.16482	Peter asked what Mahatma Gandhi would have done had he seen the Al-Qaeda problem.
SNT.77596.16483	"Why don't all the Muslims, Christians and other religions have a day of fasting to show Al-Qaeda that we reject their philosophy," Arun Manilal Gandhi, founder of M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence, replied.
SNT.77596.16484	Heidi Hog turned inspiration into action launching [the] Fast for Freedom 8·8·8 campaign.
SNT.77596.16485	"I maybe simplistic but sometimes its the simple things that need to be addressed," Heidi H. says.
SNT.77596.16486	Mike Wacht works in public relations and marketing, focusing on transportation and construction.
SNT.77596.16487	He is a member of the 511 Deployment Coalition and designer of Fast for Freedom 8·8·8 logo.
SNT.77596.16488	"I want to reach the whole world and let the displaced and unfortunate know they are not forgotten."
SNT.77596.16489	"It's been an inspiration and a small attempt to make a difference."
SNT.77596.16490	"I've never tried to start a world-wide movement before, so I'm fumbling through with a little imagination and a lot of faith," said Mike W.
SNT.77596.16491	A worldwide fast on August 8, 2008 is proposed, beginning at midnight for a 24-hour period.
SNT.77596.16492	Fasting is practised in many religious traditions and spiritual practices.
SNT.77596.16493	The proposed day of action, August 8, 2008, has generated many supporters, according to Heidi H. and Mike W.
SNT.77596.16493-1	 "There is a fresh buzz about encouraging people in a one-day peaceful fast from all nations to participate worldwide against war, famine, starvation, and aggressive secret governments."
SNT.98221.16494	United States Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has won the State of Florida's Republican Party primary election, edging out former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by five percent (36 versus 31%).
SNT.98221.16495	With this win, Sen. McCain is now clearly the frontrunner going into next week's Super-Tuesday primaries.
SNT.98221.16496	One time GOP front-runner Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who placed a lagging third in Florida, the state he based his campaign on, dropped out of the race Wednesday, largely because he had no previous primary wins and dwindling support.
SNT.98221.16497	McCain was quoted saying: "I want to thank my dear friend, my dear friend Rudy Giuliani, who invested his heart and soul in this primary and who conducted himself with all the qualities of the exceptional American leader he truly is".
SNT.98221.16498	Democratic Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton, also from New York, won the Democratic primary in Florida; however, due to Democratic Party policy, the state has been stripped of its delegates.
SNT.131943.16499	Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters were called in on Wednesday, September 2nd, to help contain the wildfires on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai.
SNT.131943.16500	Smaller helicopters that were fighting the fire since it started around noon on August 29th were redeployed as well.
SNT.131943.16501	According to Gen Iinuma, Maui County Civil Defense administrator, the CH-47s carry 2000-gallon buckets of water, whereas the smaller helicopters only have 100-gallon buckets.
SNT.131943.16502	The Chinooks can dump more water in fewer trips than the smaller helicopters.
SNT.131943.16503	On the other hand, the tremendous downdraft from the bigger aircraft may make the fire worse.
SNT.131943.16504	"If they don't do it right, they'll fan the fire," Iinuma said.
SNT.131943.16505	According to Iinuma, ground crews are continuing to maintain the fire's perimeter, which remained unchanged from Tuesday.
SNT.131943.16506	The helicopters are being used to fight the fires where ground crews can't reach, such as steep mountain passes and valleys.
SNT.131943.16507	Iinuma also expressed concern about a red flag advisory the National Weather service put out for all leeward areas of the Hawaiian Islands, meaning conditions are ripe for fires.
SNT.131943.16508	Lieutenant Governor James "Duke" Aiona, who took an aerial survey of Molokai's brush fire area, said it was "no immediate threat".
SNT.131943.16509	He also noted that the fire seemed to come right up to the perimeter of some properties, but almost always stopped there.
SNT.131943.16510	Aiona's observations are mirrored by a local business owners' story.
SNT.131943.16511	The wildfires destroyed the beehives of Molokai Meli, a family-owned honey business in Kapaakea, but residents admit that the beehives were not their main concern.
SNT.131943.16512	"We were just beating the edges with wet towels and sheets to try and keep it from getting to the houses that are just right over that ridge," said co-owner Brenda Kaneshiro.
SNT.131943.16513	"All that metal right there, that's where they all were, there were 33 of them," said Elijah Kaneshiro, the owner's son.
SNT.52604.16514	A man was sentenced to three years probation after he and his mother argued about "American Idol," a popular TV show in the U.S.
SNT.52604.16515	Cory Favreau hit his mother with a novelty bike chain in May after she expressed praise for last year's runner-up Katherine McPhee.
SNT.52604.16516	She was treated for a cut on her head and was released, police say.
SNT.52604.16517	Favreau, a twenty-five-year-old native of Plattsburgh, New York, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault.
SNT.52604.16518	He also pleaded guilty to a contempt charge for violating a court order to stay away from his mother.
SNT.190504.16519	20-year-old Kyle Flack, who came from Stanford-le-Hope in Essex, was deafblind and suffered from quadriplegia, cerebral palsy, and substantial learning difficulties.
SNT.190504.16520	He died in October 2006 after suffocating when his head became jammed in the railings around his hospital bed.
SNT.190504.16521	The trust admitted that health and safety breaches were a "significant cause" of his death, said Pascal Bates for the prosecution.
SNT.190504.16522	There had been significant errors in the hospital's "systems and procedures", as the patient had not been properly supervised, training of staff was inadequate, information had not been passed on correctly, and warnings had not been heeded.
SNT.190504.16523	Bates told the court that the hospital had reached "markedly short" of the required standard, adding that "[m]anagement failed to lay down correct procedures."
SNT.190504.16524	Earlier this year, Gill Flack, Kyle's mother, called for bosses of the hospital to be held personally responsible for this incident.
SNT.190504.16525	She described the hospital as the "worst place" for her child to have been cared for, saying that the standards of care there were "absolute crap".
SNT.144233.16526	Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has rejected moves by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to negotiate, saying that he had no "Israeli partner" and not being serious about peace.
SNT.144233.16527	Ahead of talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy last Friday in Paris, he called upon France to be more involved in the Middle East peace process, after expressing disappointment with Barack Obama's performance and lack of action plan; in an interview with Le Figaro he called the United States the "weak link".
SNT.144233.16528	Al-Assad said that he would not negotiate directly with Israel, but is willing to have discussions in Turkey.
SNT.144233.16529	"If Mr Netanyahu is serious, he can send a team of experts, and we'll send a team of experts to Turkey."
SNT.144233.16530	"Then we can really talk, if they're interested," he said.
SNT.144233.16531	"There is a mediator, Turkey, which is ready to resume its mediation."
SNT.144233.16532	"There is also French and European support for this process."
SNT.144233.16533	"What we lack is an Israeli partner who is ready to go forward and ready to come to a result."
SNT.144233.16534	According to the BBC, France has been the major contributor in attempting to bring Syria back to diplomatic talks.
SNT.144233.16535	French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner will attempt to stimulate talks in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians in the coming days.
SNT.144233.16536	Before talks with President Sarkozy, al-Assad had said "France must act".
SNT.144233.16537	Since Israel's creation in 1948, Syria has been in a state of war with the country, having at no point recognized the existence of the state of Israel.
SNT.144233.16538	(See List of No Recognition of Israel) The major issues of conflict between the countries at present time concern Israel's possession of the Golan Heights region, annexed in 1981, and Syria's support for Hezbollah and Hamas.
SNT.144233.16539	The last direct talks between the two states collapsed in 2000.
SNT.128986.16540	Manuel Zelaya, the president of Honduras who was removed from power by the Honduran Supreme Court, has begun making his way back to his country.
SNT.128986.16541	Flying from Washington, Zelaya is to arrive in Honduran air space at around 22:00 (GMT).
SNT.128986.16542	The former president had announced his willingness to return to his country, hoping for a reintegration.
SNT.128986.16543	Zelaya asked his people to be able to "practice his rights peacefully" after his arrival in the Central American country.
SNT.128986.16544	Nevertheless, the interim government that deposed Zelaya has announced that the flight would not be allowed to land.
SNT.128986.16545	Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez said "I have ordered to not allow him to enter, whoever he comes with, to avoid the imprudence of allowing a president of the republic to die, of allowing a president of the republic to get hurt, of allowing a person to die".
SNT.128986.16546	Zelaya travels together with the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Miguel D'Escoto.
SNT.128986.16547	Other leaders of Latin America, who had promised to travel together with Zelaya, will instead monitor the development of events from El Salvador.
SNT.128986.16548	Among these leaders are the presidents Rafel Correa (Ecuador), Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (Argentina) and Fernando Lugo (Paraguay), together with the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS), José Miguel Insulza.
SNT.128986.16549	Zelaya's return takes place after the Organization of American States (OAS) voted in favour of suspending Honduras from the organization.
SNT.128986.16550	OAS resolved to suspend "immediately" the de facto Honduran government lead by Roberto Micheletti in accordance with the Inter-American Democratic Charter.
SNT.128986.16551	However, fear has aroused that Zelaya's return could trigger more violence.
SNT.128986.16552	The archbishop of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, urged Zelaya not to return, fearing a possible "bloodbath".
SNT.118536.16553	Fiji and New Zealand are engaged in a game of diplomatic tit-fot-tat after expelling each other's High Commissioners.
SNT.118536.16554	This afternoon Fiji's military regime expelled acting New Zealand High Commissioner to Fiji Caroline McDonald.
SNT.118536.16555	The New Zealand government retaliated by expelling Fiji's High Commissioner to Wellington, Ponsami Chetty.
SNT.118536.16556	Both will be given a week to leave the country.
SNT.118536.16557	McDonald's expulsion was announced late this afternoon by Fiji's interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, who said that it was "a direct result of McDonald's actions over the past year that have been contrary to the accepted international norms of diplomatic behaviour".
SNT.118536.16558	The Fijian government has accused New Zealand and Australia of spying on Fiji, claiming they were tapping phone lines and listening in on members of the interim regime.
SNT.118536.16559	The New Zealand government has denied any "misbehaviour" by McDonald.
SNT.118536.16560	The round of diplomatic tit-for-tat was sparked by growing tensions between New Zealand and Fiji over sanctions put in place in the wake of the 2006 coup.
SNT.118536.16561	Members of the interim regime and their immediate families are barred from entering New Zealand.
SNT.118536.16562	Last week the Fijian regime threatened to expel New Zealand's High Commissioner unless the New Zealand government granted a visa to George Nacewa, the son of a senior regime official.
SNT.118536.16563	But yesterday the interim regime apparently backed down on its threat, issuing a statement that it would not expel McDonald and announcing that it would establish a special team to improve relations between the two countries.
SNT.118536.16564	McDonald is the second New Zealand diplomat expelled by Fiji.
SNT.118536.16565	In June 2007 then-New Zealand High Commissioner Michael Green was expelled after being accused of interfering in the country's domestic affairs.
SNT.118536.16566	Last week ONE News Pacific Correspondent Barbara Dreaver was deported as she arrived to cover the crisis.
SNT.118536.16567	Fiji's military overthrew the country's elected government in a military coup in December 2006.
SNT.5676.16568	The mother of Brazilian soccer player Luis Fabiano has been kidnapped.
SNT.5676.16569	The police are not giving too many details, and a great part of local media is not reporting the case, afraid of putting the life of Fabiano's mother at risk.
SNT.5676.16570	On November 6, 2004, the mother of Robson dos Santos, or Robinho, was kidnapped.
SNT.5676.16571	In both cases, the hostages were released and they are well, and the police arrested the suspects.
SNT.108955.16572	A building in Iran's capital Tehran collapsed today and killed at least 19 people.
SNT.108955.16573	The victims were all labourers living inside the building, which is reported to have been in a seriously unstable condition for a month, with occupants refusing to comply with evacuation requests.
SNT.108955.16574	The early morning disaster in the Sa'adatabad district reduced the building to rubble in seconds.
SNT.108955.16575	The seven story building was described by The Canadian Press as 'dilapidated'.
SNT.108955.16576	Five people have been arrested, including the owner and contractors.
SNT.108955.16577	Iranian state media promised that those responsible would be dealt with severely.
SNT.80810.16578	A Russian teenager has accomplished an unprecedented feat in the history of world aviation.
SNT.80810.16579	He flew a distance of 1,300 kilometres in a wheel well of a Boeing 737 and lived.
SNT.80810.16580	The fifteen year old Andrey Scherbakov spent two hours in the wheel well of the airplane at extreme temperature of −50° centigrade.
SNT.80810.16581	The rear wheels do not go all the way into the plane; the wheel merely retracts into an opening and remains exposed.
SNT.80810.16582	The boy managed to bypass security at the Perm city airport to hide in the plane as it took off.
SNT.80810.16583	Airport workers found the boy after the plane had landed at Moscow.
SNT.80810.16584	The boy was delivered to the hospital by the airport staff and is said to be in a critical condition.
SNT.80810.16585	His arms and legs were so severely frozen and swollen that the rescuers were not able to remove his coat and shoes.
SNT.80810.16586	There is a probability that his hands may have to be amputated.
SNT.80810.16587	However, according to the medical staff at the hospital, it is nothing short of a miracle that the boy survived the ordeal.
SNT.80810.16588	The Boeing 737 has a cruising speed of 900 kilometres per hour and was flying constantly at an altitude of 10,000 metres for two hours.
SNT.80810.16589	As a result, the boy suffered severe frostbite in both of his hands.
SNT.80810.16590	Doctors in Ural city would have to remove his fingertips, which contracted gangrene after they had frozen, but they were committed to do everything within their power to stop it from spreading.
SNT.80810.16591	When Scherbakov finally came to his senses, he told the police that he had run away from his family so as to escape his alcoholic father.
SNT.80810.16592	He said that he was wandering around the territory of the airport and noticed a hole in the fence.
SNT.80810.16593	He fell asleep during his examination of the stowaway of the plane.
SNT.80810.16594	It is curious how the inspection staff and the technicians found nothing on their inspection of the aircraft just before the flight.
SNT.80810.16595	The boy claims that he fainted soon after and came around only when the plane had landed in Moscow after traveling hundreds of kilometres from Perm.
SNT.80810.16596	However, Moscow's air and water transport control department said that the claim was true.
SNT.80810.16597	A department spokesperson said that the incident happened on Friday, and the boy's parents were immediately informed and flew into the capital on the same day.
SNT.80810.16598	Stowaways in wheel wells risk freezing to death after take-off or being crushed when the wheels retract.
SNT.80810.16599	This year, a body was found in the wheel well of a jet in San Francisco after a flight from Shanghai and another body was found in Atlanta after a flight from Dakar, Senegal.
SNT.81458.16600	Zork Hun is running for the Libertarian party in the Ontario provincial election, in the Parkdale-High Park riding.
SNT.81458.16601	Wikinews' Nick Moreau interviewed him regarding his values, his experience, and his campaign.
SNT.81458.16602	Stay tuned for further interviews; every candidate from every party is eligible, and will be contacted.
SNT.81458.16603	Expect interviews from Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, New Democratic Party members, Ontario Greens, as well as members from the Family Coalition, Freedom, Communist, Libertarian, and Confederation of Regions parties, as well as independents.
SNT.119310.16604	Services were slowly restored after an unscheduled strike by SNCF drivers closed one of Paris's six main railway stations.
SNT.119310.16605	Gare Saint-Lazare was closed from 10 am local time on Tuesday morning.
SNT.119310.16606	Members of the Sud Rail labour union later voted to return to work, and the station re-opened at 7 pm the same day.
SNT.119310.16607	Gare Saint-Lazare is Europe's third busiest station, and its lines serve Paris suburbs, as well as inter-city routes to Normandy in northern France.
SNT.31936.16608	In a move aimed to prevent fines stemming from its antitrust lawsuit filed by the European Commission (EC), Microsoft announced that it will be releasing portions of the source code to its Windows operating system.
SNT.31936.16609	The EC ruled in March 2004 that Microsoft had abused its position in the low-end server and media player market, and required that Microsoft "disclose complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers".
SNT.31936.16610	Microsoft reacted by making available 12,000 pages of technical documentation and up to 500 hours of technical support, but the EC came to the conclusion that it was not enough.
SNT.31936.16611	Announcing that "we are putting our most valuable intellectual property on the table so we can put technical compliance issues to rest", Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith asserted that Microsoft would be superseding the EC's requirements as a sign of good faith.
SNT.31936.16612	"While we are confident that we are presently in full compliance with the Decision, we wish to dispel any notion that Microsoft’s technical documents are insufficient", said Smith.
SNT.31936.16613	The EC responded in a memo that it will study Microsoft's reply to the Statement of Objections once it receives the full details.
SNT.31936.16614	However, EC Competition Commissioner spokesman Jonathan Todd commented that "it would be premature to conclude access to the source code would resolve the problem of the lack of compliance with our decision."
SNT.31936.16615	A similar offer was made by Microsoft in August 2002 during its antitrust lawsuit filed by the United States Department of Justice and several states' Attorneys General.
SNT.31936.16616	The resulting "Microsoft Communications Protocols Program" had suffered continuous criticism regarding excessive cost, paperwork, and non-disclosure agreements.
SNT.31936.16617	It is unclear at this time if Microsoft's planned "Work Group Server Protocol Program" will suffer from the same issues if accepted by the EC.
SNT.31936.16618	Microsoft is expected to return to the EC courts in April.
SNT.96436.16619	Two days before Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography, a biography of actor Tom Cruise written by journalist Andrew Morton, was released in the United States, a video showing Cruise promoting Scientology was leaked to the Internet.
SNT.96436.16620	The promotional video appeared on video-sharing sites including YouTube, Gawker.com and radar online.com, and clips from the video were also shown on Wednesday morning talk shows in the United States.
SNT.96436.16621	In the 9-minute video produced by the Church of Scientology, Cruise is seen discussing his beliefs while the theme from his Mission: Impossible films plays as background music.
SNT.96436.16622	Cruise appears wearing a black turtleneck sweater, speaking about his dedication to changing people's lives.
SNT.96436.16623	The format of the video appears to be an interview with Cruise, and it is edited with questions cut out.
SNT.96436.16624	Throughout the video, Cruise uses Scientology jargon terms such as "KSW": "For me, it’s all about KSW."
SNT.96436.16625	The term stands for Keeping Scientology Working, which refers to a 10-point letter written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1965 to ensure the organization's survival.
SNT.96436.16626	Cruise also discusses "SPs", or Suppressive Persons, "PTSPs", a "potential trouble source" influenced by a Suppressive Person, and the need to "confront and shatter suppression".
SNT.96436.16627	Cruise makes assertions about programs which use Hubbard's teachings such as Criminon and Narconon "We're the authorities on getting people off drugs."
SNT.96436.16628	Of the manner in which he wishes to spread Scientology's message, he says "You're in the playing field or out of the arena."
SNT.96436.16629	The video concludes with Cruise laughing, and then a voiceover says: "Scientology can be defined by a single question: would you want others to develop the knowledge you have?"
SNT.96436.16629-1	" In answering that question, Tom Cruise has introduced LRH [L. Ron Hubbard] technology to more than 1 billion people on earth."
SNT.96436.16630	"And that is only the first wave he has unleashed."
SNT.96436.16631	"That is why the story of Tom Cruise, Scientologist, has only just begun."
SNT.96436.16632	According to Reuters, the Church of Scientology stated that the video was shown at a 2004 meeting of the International Association of Scientologists.
SNT.96436.16633	In a statement, the Church of Scientology said that the video was Cruise's acceptance speech after he had been given the organization's "Freedom Medal", and was shown "before an audience of 5,000 church parishioners and their guests."
SNT.96436.16634	The statement also called the video that appeared on the Internet a "pirated and edited version."
SNT.96436.16635	A representative for Cruise confirmed the Church of Scientology statement: "The video is of Mr. Cruise making an acceptance speech to fellow parishioners at a private church event in 2004."
SNT.96436.16636	David Miscavige, head of the Church of Scientology, had presented Cruise with the "Freedom Medal of Valor" at the 2004 ceremony.
SNT.96436.16637	Eighty Scientologists have received the "Freedom Medal" since the award's establishment in 1985, but Cruise is the only recipient of the Freedom Medal of Valor.
SNT.96436.16638	Andrew Morton's Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography characterizes Cruise as the second most powerful individual within the organization.
SNT.96436.16639	The video first appeared on the Internet on Sunday, and disappeared after the footage was linked to from Gawker.com and The Huffington Post.
SNT.96436.16640	Gawker.com posted a copy of the video Tuesday morning, and said that the video had "been passed around privately by reporters and writers investigating Cruise's ties to Scientology."
SNT.96436.16641	Gawker.com noted that a smaller video clip which had previously been available on YouTube "is no longer available, most likely after the Church of Scientology sent in a copyright infringement notice."
SNT.96436.16642	Gawker.com has stated that the video will stay up on its site, and has reprinted correspondence with Ava Paquette, an attorney with Moxon & Kobrin, a law firm representing the Church of Scientology.
SNT.96436.16643	Nick Denton of Gawker.com commented on the posting of the video "It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it."
SNT.96436.16644	Investigative journalist Mark Ebner is helping to post more than two hours of additional footage related to the Cruise video, and called it "the most unintentionally hilarious footage you've ever seen," and characterized it as "better than" when Cruise jumped on Oprah's couch during a May 23, 2005 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and the South Park parody of Cruise in the controversial episode "Trapped in the Closet".
SNT.96436.16645	Ebner appeared on The Today Show on Wednesday, and discussed the video's appearance on the Internet.
SNT.96436.16646	In response, the Church of Scientology called Ebner a "fraud".
SNT.96436.16647	Ebner told the New York Daily News that "These tapes were made for purposes of recruitment."
SNT.96436.16648	Attempts by the Church of Scientology to stop distribution of the video via the Internet "seem to have backfired spectacularly," according to The Press Association, and by Thursday the video was viewable on websites other than Gawker.com, including the New York Post, Independent Television News and the BBC.
SNT.96436.16649	For websites based in Britain usage of the video is protected under copyright laws, specifically for reporting news and current affairs.
SNT.96436.16650	Still other reports on the video linked to locations where it could be watched, including a report in The Times.
SNT.96436.16651	Copies of the video were not available on Google Video on Thursday, but were still available on YouTube.
SNT.96436.16652	Attorney Mark Stephens of London-based firm Finers Stephens Innocent commented on the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the video from the Internet: "The Scientologists, by taking action to enforce their copyrights, have made it a news story."
SNT.96436.16653	"The mistake was not to foresee that a news story has special protection in copyright law in reporting news and current events."
SNT.145268.16654	Yousuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister of Pakistan, has told British prime minister Gordon Brown that Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is not in the country.
SNT.145268.16655	Brown hailed Pakistan's efforts to "disrupt the activities of al-Qaeda", and referred to them as his "allies", promising to provide another £50 million to support the operations to stabilise the borders of the nation; announcing this pledge, he said "This is your fight but it is also Britain's fight."
SNT.145268.16656	Gilani said in a press conference today "I doubt the information which you are giving is correct because I don't think Osama Bin Laden is in Pakistan."
SNT.145268.16657	He argues that the intelligence provided by the United States is not "credible or actionable", and requested "more clarity" from the US before he could act on it.
SNT.145268.16658	He said that Pakistani officials "are carefully examining" Barack Obama's new Afghanistan plan, which he announced yesterday, before making a decision on whether or not to support it.
SNT.46256.16659	The month long election campaign in the run up to this weekend's elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo has ended, with a one day break before voting can begin Sunday.
SNT.46256.16660	The fiercely fought campaign began on June 29th and involved no less than 9,707 parliamentary candidates and 33 presidential candidates.
SNT.46256.16661	Canvassing ended yesterday with a mass rally in support of the current president Joseph Kabila.
SNT.46256.16662	Kabila, who became the youngest head of state in Africa in 2001, used his final speech before voting to claim credit for taking the D.R.Congo to its first democratic elections in over 40 years.
SNT.46256.16664	"I can say to you without false modesty: mission accomplished" he told crowds of around 50,000 on Friday, "We've reunited and pacified the country."
SNT.46256.16665	"It is also a message of hope, and for peace and development and security after the polls."
SNT.46256.16666	The international community is taking a keen interest in the elections — the first since 1961.
SNT.46256.16667	However, the July campaign has been marred by violence and accusations of fraud on all sides.
SNT.46256.16668	International observers, such as the Carter Centre, expressed concern that the incumbent President's domination of the media would undermine the campaign.
SNT.46256.16669	Several hundred people protested at alleged irregularities in the polls on the 18th of July, which ended in 7 people being killed in police clashes.
SNT.46256.16670	This Thursday, 6 people were killed in election related incidents in the capital, Kinshasa, and yesterday, Kabila's presidential guards killed an opposition candidate's bodyguard in a gunfight.
SNT.46256.16671	50,000 polling stations have been set up around the country, for the 25.6 million voters, with over 60,000 Congolese police and 1,700 international observers in place to monitor voting.
SNT.81956.16672	Argentina reached their first ever World Cup semi-final with a 19-13 victory over Scotland in the quarter-final stage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France.
SNT.81956.16673	Scotland took the lead with a penalty from Dan Parks.
SNT.81956.16674	However Felipe Contepomi kicked two penalties as Argentina moved ahead, before Gonzalo Longo Elía added a try to extend their lead.
SNT.81956.16675	Chris Paterson responded with a penalty just before half time, but Argentina went into the interval leading 13-6.
SNT.81956.16676	Argentina extended their lead further after the break with a third penalty from Felipe Contepomi and a drop goal from Juan Martín Hernández.
SNT.81956.16677	Chris Cusiter scored a try for Scotland with seventeen minutes remaining, but they could not make a breakthrough as Argentina held on to win.
SNT.81956.16678	South Africa, who defeated Fiji earlier today, await Argentina in the semi-finals.
SNT.65379.16679	Manchester United and Watford met Saturday at the neutral ground of Villa Park for the semi-final of the FA Cup.
SNT.65379.16680	Both teams went into the game on highs, as United had thrashed Roma 7-1 during the week, and Watford had defeated Portsmouth 4-2 in the Premiership.
SNT.65379.16681	With that confidence boost for Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd, Watford sported an attacking lineup with Hameur Bouazza and Tamas Priskin as strikers.
SNT.65379.16682	United's recent injury troubles allowed Alan Smith to play as strike partner to Wayne Rooney with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on the bench.
SNT.65379.16683	The first chance in the match fell to United, and the Red Devils capitalized.
SNT.65379.16684	A long ball by Carrick was left by both Smith and Giggs before it came to Rooney, and he cut inside before blasting a shot high to the right of Richard Lee, giving United an early lead.
SNT.65379.16685	Watford were not dispirited by the early goal, and soon began to create chances through set pieces.
SNT.65379.16686	A flailing boot by a Watford player in the area connected with Edwin Van Der Sar's recently healed nose, and the big Dutch keeper had to have splints put in before play could continue.
SNT.65379.16687	Watford took advantage of the stoppage to catch their breath, and scored as soon as play resumed when Hameur Bouazza's side footed volley caught Van Der Sar unaware, and crept in off the crossbar after deflecting off Gabriel Heinze.
SNT.65379.16688	United's response was nearly instant, as Smith's pass into Rooney released him on the right.
SNT.65379.16689	After Lee nearly blocked a pass into Ronaldo, the Portuguese winger was able to bobble the ball home, scoring his twenty-first goal of the season, and restoring United's lead.
SNT.65379.16690	Gavin Mahon then had a chance to equalize again for Watford, but his side footed volley was saved by Van Der Sar.
SNT.65379.16691	Ronaldo then had a chance for his second as he was released by Rooney, but a last ditch tackle by DeMerit kept the scoreline at 2-1.
SNT.65379.16692	A groin injury for United's Rio Ferdinand then forced Alex Ferguson to replace him with Darren Fletcher, a move which saw a shuffle in the entire back line.
SNT.65379.16693	Rooney then had a chance for a brace, but his hard shot was palmed away by Lee.
SNT.65379.16694	Watford started the second half strongly with Bouazza nearly scoring off a long throw, but his side footed effort went just wide.
SNT.65379.16695	Alan Smith then set up Rooney's second goal of the match as his curling cross was easily deflected in by Rooney's left foot.
SNT.65379.16696	Cristiano Ronaldo was then replaced with Kieran Richardson, and the substitute made nearly an instant impact, scoring United's fourth goal of the afternoon.
SNT.65379.16697	A well timed pass by Smith was met by the sprinting Richardson, and he easily chipped the ball over Lee and into the back of the net to secure a place in the final for United.
SNT.65379.16698	Relegation bound Watford will meet Blackburn in the Premiership next, while United have a league game of their own at Old Trafford against Sheffield United.
SNT.102842.16699	A final report released today by the Indonesian National Transport Safety Committee found that Adam Air Flight 574 crashed because the pilots were distracted by an instrument failure.
SNT.102842.16700	The loss of the budget carrier's Boeing 737 into the sea near Sulawesi on New Year's Day 2007 left all 102 on board missing and presumed dead.
SNT.102842.16701	The report found that the 737, registered PK-KKW, suffered a Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure.
SNT.102842.16702	While pilots were troubleshooting for this navigational system they first unintentionally disconnected the autopilot, then failed to monitor other instruments informing them they were approaching the sea, crashing into it and destroying the aircraft.
SNT.102842.16703	The flight had been a scheduled domestic passenger service between Djuanda Airport at Surabaya and Sam Ratulangi Airport at Manado, and disappeared from radar screens at 35,000 feet.
SNT.102842.16704	National Transportation Safety Committee head Tatang Kurniadi told a press conference "This accident resulted from a combination of factors including the failure of the pilots to adequately monitor the flight instruments, especially in the last two minutes of the flight."
SNT.102842.16705	Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System diverted both pilot's attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and bank angle to unnoticed...
SNT.102842.16706	"The Cockpit Voice recorder revealed that both pilots were concerned about navigation problems and subsequently become engrossed with trouble shooting Inertial Reference System (IRS) anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements."
SNT.102842.16707	He also supplied a number of statistics concerning the final moments of the flight.
SNT.102842.16708	Whilst in a right bank with sustained elevator input pushing up the nose the aircraft reached Mach 0.926 and 3.5g.
SNT.102842.16709	The airspeed had reached 490 KCAS by the end of the recording.
SNT.102842.16710	Investigator Santoso Sayogo said that the high speed impact caused the plane to disintegrate.
SNT.102842.16711	In 2006 another B737 suffered a navigational problem and flew into a radar blackspot, leaving it lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from the intended destination.
SNT.102842.16712	Sayogo said today that in the three months preceding the accident the airline had registered 154 defects in PK-KKW's navigational equipment.
SNT.102842.16713	The crash, coupled with Adam Air Flight 172, which snapped in half during a hard landing, and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which overshot the runway in Yogyakarta, killing 21, prompted the European Union to add all Indonesia's airlines to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.
SNT.102842.16714	Earlier this month another Adam Air flight departed the end of a runway during landing, injuring five and damaging the plane.
SNT.102842.16715	This prompted the authorities to ground Adam Air for three months after a regular evaluation, after which they may be permanently shut down.
SNT.140795.16716	Nine people were killed and 31 were injured after a car bomb blew up in the city of Falluja in western Iraq, local officials said.
SNT.140795.16717	This is the second bomb blast in the Anbar province within the past few days.
SNT.140795.16718	Six people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated explosives at a funeral in Haditha on Monday.
SNT.140795.16719	"Security forces are still looking for victims under the rubble," said the head of the Amiriya local municipal council, Shaker al-Issawi.
SNT.140795.16720	According to reports from witnesses, the blast was so strong that it threw bodies onto rooftops of neighbouring buildings.
SNT.140795.16721	Unlike previous such explosions, this explosion did not appear to be set by a suicide bomber.
SNT.140795.16722	A witness near where the car bomb exploded said that a man had parked a blue truck, and left it a quarter of an hour before it exploded.
SNT.120210.16723	The British rail regulator has announced new train services for the country's premier line.
SNT.120210.16724	New "open access" (unregulated and non-franchised) company Grand Northern is to be given space (known in the industry as "paths") to run three train services a day between London King's Cross and Bradford, Halifax, Wakefield and Pontefract in West Yorkshire.
SNT.120210.16725	Grand Northern's sister open access company Grand Central was given an extra path to increase services between King's Cross and Sunderland.
SNT.120210.16726	The existing franchisee of the line, National Express East Coast, was given the right to run services to London from Harrogate, Lincoln and Bradford, but not provided with paths unless the government changes the contracts of the other franchises whose territory these services would cross.
SNT.120210.16727	Two other potential open access providers had their plans rejected by the regulator.
SNT.120210.16728	First Group's Hull Trains had wanted to start a new service, Harrogate Trains, to run from North Yorkshire to London, whilst Platinum Trains had sought paths from London to Aberdeen in Scotland.
SNT.120210.16729	Britain's state-owned national railway company British Rail was controversially split-up and privatized in stages between 1993 and 1997.
SNT.120210.16730	It was replaced by a series of privately owned regional train franchises for set periods, several unfranchised open access services and a track control and maintenance company.
SNT.120389.16731	A local Swiss government has shown some bare cheek and has taken action, after hordes of German naked hikers rambling across the Swiss alps au naturel, caused indignation amongst locals.
SNT.120389.16732	Authorities in Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden have warned that starting from February 9, the government will impose hefty fines of 200 Swiss Francs (£122, €135) on naturists found walking or hiking in the nude without clothes in the picturesque mountains because of a recent influx of visiting German nudists.
SNT.120389.16733	The new ordinance is expected to be passed this spring.
SNT.120389.16734	If it is approved by the local parliament on February 9 it should be effective on April 26.
SNT.120389.16735	The Swiss canton aims to stop spread of 'indecent practice' by minimally-clad German climbers.
SNT.120389.16736	The problem started with a group of "boot-only hikers" who were stopped by the police in the Alpine region last autumn.
SNT.120389.16737	They had wandered there regularly, proudly marching through nature with bare bums, and had also advertised what they thought was a naked paradise on the internet.
SNT.120389.16738	A nude rambler dressed in nothing more than a rucksack and walking boots in the eastern Appenzell region was arrested and detained in the canton, but authorities were unable to file lawsuit because the act was not punished by law or ordinance at the time.
SNT.120389.16739	"We were forced to introduce the legislation against this indecent practice before the warm weather starts," Melchior Looser, the canton’s justice and police minister, said.
SNT.120389.16740	“Ultimately, in the summer lots of kids stay in our mountains,” he added.
SNT.120389.16741	In the guidelines imposed, arrested offenders who cannot pay the fine, will face legal action.
SNT.120389.16742	The new enabling ordinance has, however, been met with protests by nude hikers.
SNT.120389.16743	"It's the most harmless pursuit possible," said Dietmar, age 58, a German lawyer.
SNT.120389.16744	German tabloid Bild Zeitung has editorially attacked Swiss intolerance and even suggested nudist alternatives worldwide, after hinting a Swiss tourism boycott.
SNT.120389.16745	Local authorities of Harz mountain range in central Germany have also announced the openness to any visitor of an “official naked walking route” in nature's outdoors.
SNT.120389.16746	The naked ramblers have hoped it doesn't lead to another naturist-clothed 'war', like the one at a beach between German and Polish holidaymakers in 2008.
SNT.120389.16747	Naturism has roots traced from the start of the 20th century.
SNT.120389.16748	"Abandoning unpractical clothes enables a direct contact with the wind, sun and temperature", naked hiker website nacktwandern.de stated.
SNT.120389.16749	"The local people are upset and we in the government share their concern."
SNT.120389.16750	"How would one feel if one was to go walking in nature and suddenly came across a group of naked people? "
SNT.120389.16750-1	"They are definitely not people from the area, and I think many of them come from Germany,” he noted.
SNT.120389.16751	"I can understand that we all have to live in this world together," said Barbara Foley, International Naturist Foundation member of the central committee.
SNT.120389.16752	"But I would certainly enjoy doing the hike in the nude and I wouldn't want to be deprived of it."
SNT.120389.16753	"Maybe they should designate a couple of trails and people would know they might come across naturists there," she added.
SNT.120389.16754	Appenzell Innerrhoden (Appenzell Inner Rhodes) is the smallest canton of Switzerland by population and the second smallest by area, Basel-City having less area.
SNT.120389.16755	The population of the canton was 15,471 as of 2007, of which 1,510 (or 9.76%) were foreigners.
SNT.120389.16756	The canton in the north east of Switzerland has an area is 173 km².
SNT.120389.16757	It was divided in 1597 for religious reasons from the former canton Appenzell, with Appenzell Ausserrhoden being the other half.
SNT.120389.16758	Most of the canton is pastoral, this despite being mountainous.
SNT.120389.16759	Cattle breeding and dairy farming are the main agricultural activities: Appenzeller cheese is widely available throughout Switzerland.
SNT.120389.16760	Due to the split of Appenzell along religious lines, the population (as of 2000) is nearly all Roman Catholic (81%), with a small Protestant minority (10%).
SNT.120389.16761	The town, however is far from liberalism: the canton granted women the right of suffrage only in 1990 under pressure from the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and international human rights groups.
SNT.120389.16762	The Alpine village of Appenzell Innerrhoden, being known for its beautiful landscape, has recently been declared a "naked rambler paradise" by a German mountaineering website, which was created by a lobby group of hikers.
SNT.57924.16763	An ethical controversy has surged in the United States and elsewhere around nine-year-old Ashley X (her family name has not been released).
SNT.57924.16764	The disabled girl was operated upon at the request of her parents, to prevent her from growing, menstruating and developing breasts.
SNT.57924.16765	The parents, who wish to remain anonymous, explain their situation on a blog entitled The "Ashley Treatment".
SNT.57924.16766	There have been over 1000 reactions on the blog so far.
SNT.57924.16767	Ashley suffers a condition termed static encephalopathy with marked global developmental deficits of unknown etiology, which means brain damage of unknown cause leading to a kind of static condition.
SNT.57924.16768	She can make sounds, move her arms and kick her legs, but she cannot change her position, eat, walk, talk etc.
SNT.57924.16769	Many of these children are in poor health and die young, but Ashley is in good health.
SNT.57924.16770	For all of these functions she depends on her caregivers.
SNT.57924.16771	Most of the day she passes watching her surrounding, lying on a pillow.
SNT.57924.16772	Her parents call her their "Pillow Angel", "since she is so sweet and stays right where we place her—usually on a pillow."
SNT.57924.16773	Ashley's parents want to keep her at home and care for her themselves, and they want to guarantee their daughter's quality of life.
SNT.57924.16774	To this end, they say, Ashley underwent several surgical procedures and medical treatments during a period of three years.
SNT.57924.16775	To attenuate her growth, Ashley was given high doses of the hormone estrogen.
SNT.57924.16776	Ashley now measures 4ft 5 (1m 35cm) and weighs around 75 lbs (34 kg), which is below her expected length and weight.
SNT.57924.16777	Her low body weight and size would improve her comfort, and at the same time facilitate the work of her caregivers.
SNT.57924.16778	Surgery to remove her uterus (a procedure called a hysterectomy) and breast buds were performed, so Ashley does not menstruate and will not develop breasts, both of which parents think only would cause her discomfort.
SNT.57924.16779	Since high estrogen levels can cause menstrual bleeding and breast development, the surgery was also meant to limit these effects.
SNT.57924.16780	She also underwent surgery to remove her appendix, because it would be difficult to diagnose appendicitis given Ashley's low communication possibilities.
SNT.246864.16781	Leader of the Federal Opposition in Australia Tony Abbott has made claims Thursday during Question Time in parliament that a 'people's revolt' is looming based on the Prime Minister Julia Gillard's proposal for a 2012 carbon tax.
SNT.246864.16782	In what Mr. Abbott describes as a "betrayal of the Australian people", Ms. Gillard announced Thursday that a price for carbon will be put back on the national agenda, for several years, to be followed by the formation of an emissions trading scheme.
SNT.246864.16783	In the lead up to the 2010 Federal Australian Election, Ms. Gillard claimed that while she might implement a green house gas reduction scheme, "[she would] rule out a carbon tax".
SNT.246864.16784	The price on carbon will be applied to industrial and transport emissions but will not, however, affect Australia's agriculture.
SNT.246864.16785	The Prime Minister's announcement resulted in a large portion of Question Time being devoted to the issue with a Member of the Opposition being expelled from the House for disorderly conduct.
SNT.246864.16786	Mr. Abbot then moved to censure the Prime Minister and conclude Question Time claiming "Nothing is more fake than making a promise to the Australian people before the election and breaking it after the election …"
SNT.246864.16787	"I don't believe it's going to happen because I think there will be a people's revolt."
SNT.246864.16788	"They will see this as an assault on their standard of living, which is exactly what it is".
SNT.246864.16789	To which the Prime Minister responded "Increasingly Australians understand that the Liberal Party, under the Leader of the Opposition, is a party of the past with no real policies or plans for the nation's future …"
SNT.246864.16790	"You get judged ultimately in this Parliament by what you decide to do and what you deliver, and on this side of the Parliament we are determined that from July 1 (2012) we will price carbon."
SNT.246864.16791	The Opposition claims that the proposed carbon tax will cause petrol prices to rise by A$0.065 per litre while energy bills may increase by $300 per year.
SNT.76695.16792	Police apprehended a 18 inch tall monkey that is reported to have bitten a 20 year-old woman outside State Street Brats, a Madison, Wisconsin nightclub.
SNT.76695.16793	The long-tailed, black and white monkey, which was wearing a diaper, was leashed in a beer garden outside the nightclub on State Street when people began to pet the animal.
SNT.76695.16794	When the woman approached the monkey around 1:00 a.m. CDT (UTC-5) on Wednesday morning and put her hand out to pet it, it bit her then escaped the garden and led police on a seven hour 'monkey hunt' before it was caught.
SNT.76695.16795	The woman was left with four puncture wounds to her thumb.
SNT.76695.16796	Doctors are said to be testing blood samples from the monkey to check for diseases.
SNT.76695.16797	"This guy was in the beer garden at State Street Brats letting women pet his monkey," said a spokesman for the Madison police Department, Joel DeSpain.
SNT.76695.16798	Police say the monkey will remain in quarantine for at least ten days.
SNT.187091.16799	Irish Senator Kieran Phelan has died suddenly at the age of 60.
SNT.187091.16800	Phelan died after falling ill in his hotel in Dublin this morning, shortly before a meeting due to be held by the Seanad.
SNT.187091.16801	Phelan sat on the Industrial and Commercial Panel and had been a Senator since 2002.
SNT.187091.16802	He was also a Laois County councillor and was elected council chairman in 1998.
SNT.187091.16803	He is a constituency colleague of mine and a lifelong friend.
SNT.187091.16804	As a mark of respect, Leader of the House Donie Cassidy proposed that the house be adjourned until June 1st.
SNT.20897.16805	New Orleans police shot eight armed gunmen on the Danziger Bridge, according to a police statement, after contractors crossing the bridge came under fire.
SNT.20897.16806	The police claim they shot at eight people carrying guns on the bridge.
SNT.20897.16807	This comes as Mayor Robin Nagin began to turn the city over to state and federal control.
SNT.20897.16808	The fourteen contractors were en route to launch barges into Lake Pontchartrain in order to fix the break in the 17th Street Canal when, according to police, the gunmen opened fire on the group.
SNT.20897.16809	Deputy Police Chief W.J. Riley said police shot at eight people carrying guns, killing five or six.
SNT.20897.16810	However, according to foreign sources, the five killed were contractors for the Army.
SNT.20897.16811	In a unrelated incident, a civilian helicopter crashed near the Danziger Bridge.
SNT.20897.16812	The two passengers on board escaped with only minor cuts and scrapes.
SNT.20897.16813	The Danziger Bridge spans a canal which connects Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River.
SNT.81663.16814	Jean Chrétien, one of Canada's former prime ministers, received quadruple heart bypass surgery yesterday at Montreal's Heart Institute.
SNT.81663.16815	He's well and he's recuperating very well at the moment.
SNT.81663.16816	"His outcome is excellent," said Chief of surgery, Dr. Michel Pellerin.
SNT.81663.16817	He could have risked his life as he was diagnosed with unstable angina.
SNT.81663.16818	It is caused by obstructed arteries, which causes heart pain in a person's body.
SNT.81663.16819	The golfer told him to see a doctor as soon as possible.
SNT.81663.16820	"He had a bit of discomfort and mentioned it because there was a doctor there," said a friend of Chrétien, Eddie Goldenberg.
SNT.81663.16821	"The doctor asked him a couple of questions and said, 'You better come and see me.'"
SNT.81663.16822	He had to postpone his speech at the Asia-Pacific mining conference in Vancouver, B.C..
SNT.61026.16823	Peter Dunne's proposition as the leader of the New Zealand political party, United Future, to have Waitangi Day changed back to New Zealand Day failed.
SNT.61026.16824	The New Zealand Day bill would have created disharmony within the society according to parliamentary select committee, the Justice and Electoral Committee.
SNT.61026.16825	But they do say that it could be a good idea for a completely new holiday to be created called New Zealand Day.
SNT.61026.16826	"I welcome the advice from the committee that many of the submitters were in favour of retaining Waitangi Day and having another day set aside for a national day that will celebrate everything that's good about New Zealand and being a New Zealander," said Mr Dunne.
SNT.61026.16827	Mr Dunne said the reason for his proposed change was because since New Zealand is multi-cultural, then New Zealand's national day should be one about everybody and not one about grievance.
SNT.61026.16828	Mr Dunne says that he is still backing New Zealand Day in some form despite the rejection, as he is now considering many options, including changing the Queen's Official Birthday holiday to New Zealand Day, and starting Dominion Day back up.
SNT.61026.16829	He says that he is now considering writing up a new bill to submit it to the New Zealand Parliament.
SNT.61026.16830	Waitangi day is on February 6, each year and celebrates the Waitangi signing of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi).
SNT.50048.16831	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez stated the U.S. government may have planned the September 11, 2001 attacks.
SNT.50048.16832	He said the attacks have been used to justify U.S. "aggression" throughout the Middle East and also that 9/11 conspiracy theories are plausible.
SNT.50048.16833	Chavez said in a speech Tuesday, "The hypothesis is not absurd ... that those towers could have been dynamited."
SNT.50048.16834	He also said "A building never collapses like that, unless it's with an implosion."
SNT.50048.16835	The U.S. government has maintained that Al-Qaeda orchestrated the attacks under the leadership of Osama bin Laden.
SNT.145861.16836	At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, after four days of negotiations, Africa countries have made the first draft version of future possible treaty, to replace the 1997 Kyoto protocol.
SNT.145861.16837	Africa leaders demand 5% of GDP of developed world citizens to be given as a finance to developing countries for struggle with global warming.
SNT.145861.16838	Along with this, developing countries expect rich countries to increase their emissions cuts goals.
SNT.145861.16839	Funding for developed countries was previously expected to be 130 billion US dollars.
SNT.145861.16840	The new proposal is about 11 times larger, according to 2008 GDP estimates.
SNT.145861.16841	In an interview in Copenhagen, China’s representative Su Wei commented, "The developed countries need to speed up the process and come forward with more ambitious targets by 2020."
SNT.145861.16842	Many nations offered emissions cuts pledges, which vary from 4% to 17% cuts by 2020, compared with 1990 levels.
SNT.145861.16843	The Africa's draft proposes a goal of 65% cut for every developed country.
SNT.145861.16844	Though the new goals are harder, Anders Turesson, European Union representative at UNCCC, doubted in the ability of them to prevent 2-degree warming.
SNT.145861.16845	In an interview in Copenhagen, he said, "We are concerned about the environmental integrity of these texts and we do not see how they will deliver the 2-degree target."
SNT.145861.16846	"Hopefully we will be able to step up our ambitions as we move forward in the negotiations."
SNT.145861.16847	British Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband criticised the draft text for absence of a certain temperature raise threshold, said that the new texts "are shorter texts than we’ve had before, which we can negotiate around because the imperative here is to get on with it and get to an ambitious solution".
SNT.145861.16848	Bloomberg news company interviewed several people from New York environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).
SNT.145861.16849	Its policy director David Doniger expects most difficulties to come at the end of the UNCCC, when Barack Obama and Wen Jiabao arrive at the summit: "It’s really come down to a set of difficult "
SNT.145861.16850	"It’s a lot easier for lower-level negotiators to come to an impasse and go home."
SNT.145861.16851	"It’s not easy for senior officials and definitely not easy for heads of government."
SNT.145861.16852	As international climate policy director of NRDC Jake Schmidt commented similarly, "It’s going to be a tense negotiation over emissions cuts for developed countries."
SNT.45140.16853	Zinedine Zidane has apologised on French TV for his actions on the World Cup final, Wednesday - but the apology did not extend to his victim.
SNT.45140.16854	Zidane had headbutted Italian player Marco Materazzi and was sent off after 110 minutes play.
SNT.45140.16855	But on French television Zidane showed remorse for his behaviour.
SNT.45140.16856	"I want to ask for forgiveness from all the children who watched," he said.
SNT.45140.16857	It was expected that Zidane would reveal what provoked him into the headbutt.
SNT.45140.16858	However, Zidane refused to divulge what Materazzi actually said but did say that Materazzi made remarks which were "very personal" and specifically concerned his mother and sister.
SNT.45140.16859	Materazzi had earlier admitted that he insulted Zidane, but denied any remarks on Zidane's mother or having made a racial slur.
SNT.45140.16860	"I lost my mother when I was 15 years old and still get emotional when I talk about it."
SNT.45140.16861	"Zidane is my hero and I have always admired him a lot," said Materazzi.
SNT.45140.16862	While the French star's comments contradicted Materazzi's view Zidane also refused to apologise to Materazzi for his on-field assault.
SNT.45140.16863	"I want to apologise to them [the children] but I can't regret what I did because it would mean that he [Materazzi] was right to say what he said".
SNT.45140.16864	The partial apology comes as FIFA President Sept Blatter said Zidane may be stripped of his Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.
SNT.45140.16865	FIFA set up a disciplinary committee to investigate Zidane's violent conduct.
SNT.45140.16866	After the red card to Zidane, Italy went on to win the final on penalty kicks.
SNT.57659.16867	U.S. Senator Barack Obama's family name may sound similar to that of the given name of Osama bin Laden.
SNT.57659.16868	According to prominent American left-wing online blog Daily Kos, which was the first to report it, CNN mixed the two up on Monday, leading into a segment on bin Laden with the title, "Where's Obama?" on The Situation Room, a show hosted by pundit Wolf Blitzer.
SNT.57659.16869	Soledad O'Brien and Blitzer apologised separately during CNN's American Morning on Tuesday.
SNT.57659.16870	"We want to apologize for that bad typo," Mr Blitzer said.
SNT.57659.16871	"We also want to apologize personally to Senator Barack Obama."
SNT.57659.16872	"I'm going to be making a call to him later this morning to offer my personal apology."
SNT.57659.16873	He also added that he appreciated the online blogs who brought the error to light.
SNT.57659.16874	"Though I'd note that the 's' and 'b' keys aren't all that close to each other, I assume it was just an unfortunate mistake, and don't think there was any truly malicious intent," said Tommy Vietor, Obama's press secretary.
SNT.11212.16875	The government of Canada is fighting to keep Washington from having access to passenger lists for Canada's domestic flights.
SNT.11212.16876	The Canadian transport minister Jean Lapierre said two-thirds of Canada's domestic flights at some point cross through American air space.
SNT.11212.16877	The Minister said he may have to re-route them (around U.S. airspace) rather than breach the privacy rights of domestic Canadian passengers.
SNT.11212.16878	In plans which are not yet finalized, Washington recently warned Canada (and other countries) the U.S. intends to require that its no-fly list procedures apply to all foreign airlines which pass through U.S. airspace.
SNT.11212.16879	After 9/11, a watch list of suspected terrorists was created by the U.S. that bars those on the list from air travel within its borders.
SNT.11212.16880	On Wednesday, Lapierre said it's a “very hot issue,” and that he’s working to protect the privacy of Canadians.
SNT.11212.16881	"We don’t think it’s a good idea that Canadians travelling from one (Canadian) city to another would have to be checked under the American no-fly list.” Lapierre said.
SNT.11212.16882	He estimates that nearly two-thirds of the 278,000 yearly flights between Canadian cities cross over the U.S. border.
SNT.11212.16883	Most major flight zones from urban centers in Canada are in its southern portion, close to the U.S. where even winds might push a plane across the border.
SNT.11212.16884	If the matter can not be resolved, Lapierre said, “We would have to take a northern route, which would be much more expensive.” 
SNT.11212.16884-1	Yahoo! News Canada reports that Lapierre intends to lobby U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta against the changes.
SNT.11212.16885	Last year, the Canadian province of British Columbia put controls on firms that handle an individual's personal data that prevents them from sharing private information on Canadians with U.S. authorities.
SNT.11212.16886	The issue goes to Canada's sovereignty of its citizens and the U.S. sovereignty of its airspace.
SNT.11212.16887	The historically close relations between Canada and the U.S. was evident during the recent Virgin Atlantic incident, where a flight was intercepted by 2 Canadian CF-18 jet fighters.
SNT.11212.16888	They were scrambled from Quebec to escort the inter-continental flight originating from London to the Halifax International Airport after a hijacking signal, an apparent accident, was sent from the plane.
SNT.11212.16889	The plane was detained in Halifax on Friday for approximately four hours.
SNT.11212.16890	Ultimately it was cleared, and landed safely at its original destination in John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.
SNT.11212.16891	Both the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center are involved in lawsuits against the U.S. government relating to no-fly lists.
SNT.11212.16892	EPIC has received documents under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act which it says "establish that the TSA administers two lists: a "no-fly" list and a "selectee" list, which requires the passenger to go through additional security measures."
SNT.11212.16893	"The names are provided to air carriers through Security Directives or Emergency Amendments and are stored in their computer systems so that an individual with a name that matches the list can be flagged when getting a boarding pass."
SNT.11212.16894	"A "no-fly" match requires the agent to call a law enforcement officer to detain and question the passenger."
SNT.11212.16895	"In the case of a Selectee, an "S" or special mark is printed on their boarding pass and the person receives additional screening at security."
SNT.47247.16896	PepsiCo Inc. is in line to get its first female chief executive before the end of the year.
SNT.47247.16897	Steven S. Reinemund, chairman and CEO of the U.S. soft drink and snack food giant, announced his retirement via press release effective in May, 2007.
SNT.47247.16898	Reinemund, 58, said he was leaving to spend more time with his family.
SNT.47247.16899	The same PepsiCo release confirmed that Indra Nooyi, currently president and CFO, will take over for Reinemund.
SNT.47247.16900	The first is scheduled to be filled by Richard Goodman, 57, currently CFO of PepsiCo International, who will become CFO.
SNT.47247.16901	Hugh Johnston, 44, currently senior vice president of transformation, was promoted to the newly created post of executive vice president of operations, procurement and information technology.
SNT.47247.16902	Nooyi, 50, is a Yale-educated daughter of a middle class Indian family, according to her official biography.
SNT.47247.16903	She is scheduled to succeed Reinemund, in October, the company said.
SNT.47247.16904	Together, Nooyi and Reinemund have guided PepsiCo through several large take-overs and has seen the company overtake The Coca-Cola Company both in terms of sales and market value.
SNT.47247.16905	Coca-Cola is still the No. 1 soft drink maker based on U.S. and global market share.
SNT.47247.16906	A significant portion of PepsiCo's sales revenue comes from non-drink brands in its Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats product lines.
SNT.47247.16907	Some on Wall Street were surprised by Reinemund's retirement announcement, according to news reports.
SNT.47247.16908	Monday, the stock (ticker:PEP) closed up $0.62 at $63.95 per share on the NYSE.
SNT.113836.16909	The Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization which maintains data on hate groups, has described Alamo's organization as a "cult".
SNT.113836.16910	The Ross Institute Internet Archives for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements maintains a web page on Tony Alamo and his organization.
SNT.113836.16911	AP reported that many former members of Alamo's organization also characterize the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries as a "cult".
SNT.113836.16912	Anna Pugh, a former member of the organization for 11 years, recounted some of her experiences in what she referred to as "Tony's Cult" to KOCO-TV.
SNT.113836.16913	She stated that while she was living at Alamo's compound she felt she was brainwashed.
SNT.113836.16914	Pugh says that while she was a member of the group a seven-year-old girl took her aside and told her Alamo had sexual conduct with minors while watching pornography.
SNT.113836.16915	"I think that congregation in there needs to see what that man is."
SNT.113836.16916	"He is a very unmerciful, malicious, vindictive, judgemental, condemning person," said Pugh.
SNT.113836.16917	Former member Anthony Lane told KSLA-TV he was kicked out of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries when he questioned some of Alamo's teachings.
SNT.113836.16918	"He is definitely a man who arranges marriages of little girls, and orders beatings of little children," said Lane.
SNT.113836.16919	He has been getting help from a support group called Partnered against Cult Activities (PACA).
SNT.113836.16920	Lane is trying to gain custody of his three children who are still in the group with his wife.
SNT.113836.16921	Alamo was convicted of tax evasion in 1994, and was released from prison in 1998 after serving four years out of a six year sentence.
SNT.113836.16922	The Internal Revenue Service said Alamo owed the U.S. government US$7.9 million.
SNT.113836.16923	Prosecutors in the tax evasion case argued prior to Alamo's sentencing that he was a flight risk, and a polygamist who conducted inappropriate activities with women and girls in his organization.
SNT.113836.16924	The Tony Alamo Christian Ministry organization promotes a philosophy and belief system which asserts sex with underage girls and polygamy is acceptable.
SNT.113836.16925	The organization is critical of Catholicism, homosexuality, and the government.
SNT.113836.16926	Tony Alamo Christian Ministry has compounds in Arkansas, California, Georgia and New Jersey, and Alamo himself lives near Los Angeles.
SNT.208088.16927	A researcher at the University of Oxford has found a saucy poem attributed to John Milton, the 17th-century poet who wrote Paradise Lost and other religious verse.
SNT.208088.16928	"An Extempore Upon a Faggot", discovered in an 18th-century anthology of poetry, is not thought by modern scholars to be by Milton, however, and may in fact have been written by one of his rivals in an attempt to disgrace him.
SNT.208088.16929	The poem was found by Dr Jennifer Batt, who said that it "is so out of tune with the rest of his work, that if the attribution is correct, it would prompt a major revision of our ideas about Milton."
SNT.208088.16930	She discovered the rude verse in the Harding Collection of poetry anthologies held by the Bodleian Library, the main university library at Oxford.
SNT.208088.16931	"To see the name of John Milton, the great religious and political polemicist, attached to such a bawdy epigram, is extremely surprising to say the least", she added.
SNT.208088.16932	The book in question, the Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany from 1708 (over 30 years after Milton's death), was described by another Oxford academic, Dr Abigail Williams, as "a set of poems written by witty young men about town for witty young men about town".
SNT.208088.16933	Milton wrote in blank verse rather than using rhyme and used differing poetic rhythms, whereas the handwritten poem uses a simple pattern of rhyming couplets as it contrasts the sexual behaviour of young women and more experienced women by comparing them to green wood and dry wood upon a fire.
SNT.208088.16934	Have you not in a Chimney seen 
SNT.208088.16934-1	A Faggot which is moist and green
SNT.208088.16934-2	 How coyly it receives the Heat
SNT.208088.16934-3	 And at both ends do's weep and sweat? 
SNT.208088.16934-4	 So fares it with a tender Maid
SNT.208088.16934-5	 When first upon her Back she's laid 
SNT.208088.16934-6	But like dry Wood th' experienced Dame
SNT.208088.16934-7	 Cracks and rejoices in the Flame
SNT.208088.16935	Milton (1608–1674) wrote many influential religious poems, including Paradise Lost, which is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as "widely and rightly regarded as the supreme poetic achievement in the English language, fit to sit alongside the poems of Homer, Virgil, and Dante."
SNT.208088.16936	It tells the story of the fall from grace of Adam and Eve in an epic theological poem.
SNT.208088.16937	He followed it with Paradise Regained, depicting the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness.
SNT.208088.16938	Bawdy poetry is not thought by modern academics to be in keeping with Milton's style, with Batt suggesting that it is likely that his name was added to the poem "to bring scandal upon [him], perhaps by a jealous contemporary."
SNT.208088.16939	She suggests that the culprit might have been Sir John Suckling, a poet who was a supporter of the monarchy, in contrast to the Republican Milton.
SNT.208088.16940	The University of Oxford is currently digitising the songbooks and anthologies of the Harding Collection, said to be the world's largest such collection, as part of a project to allow online access.
SNT.208088.16941	It is named after Walter Harding, a British musician who collected music and poetry in Chicago.
SNT.208088.16942	The poem had been read before, but without anyone noticing Milton's name at the bottom.
SNT.208088.16943	Dr Williams, the project's leader, expressed her doubts as to the authenticity of the attribution, commenting that "[y]ou could become very rich and famous – well, famous, anyway – if you could prove the rhyme was really by Milton."
SNT.144950.16944	Edward Natapei, the Prime Minister of Vanuatu has lost his position and parliamentary seat over a paper work blunder.
SNT.144950.16945	Natapei was in Trinidad and Tobago at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and his staff failed to file the paperwork that notified the parliamentary speaker of his absence.
SNT.144950.16946	Under Vanuatu law, since he missed three consecutive sittings of parliament without notifying the speaker in writing, he must forfeit his seat.
SNT.144950.16947	In order to comply with the law, Natapei would have needed to submit a signed explanation for his absence to the speaker.
SNT.144950.16948	The last time a similar event occurred was in the 1980s when a Member of Parliament lost his job for failure to notify the speaker of his absence.
SNT.144950.16949	Natapei is now on his way back from Trinidad and Tobago.
SNT.144950.16950	The nation is currently being run by a caretaker government.
SNT.144950.16951	Members of Parliament are set to vote for a new Prime Minister next week.
SNT.144950.16952	Natapei was elected Prime Minister on September 22, 2008, as President of the socialist, Anglophone Vanua'aku Pati party.
SNT.144950.16953	After 14 months in office, he now holds the record for the shortest term as prime minister in Vanuatu's history.
SNT.203612.16954	On Monday, Australian telecommunications company Telstra has introduced dual carrier HSPA+ standard for broadband Internet business customers in the Next G network.

SNT.203612.16956	The bandwidths the users can deploy increased into two to three times, with Telstra becoming the world’s fastest national mobile broadband service.
SNT.203612.16957	The switch started with enabling the service for premium users.
SNT.74425.16958	On Sunday two separate suicide bombing attacks killed up to 31 people.
SNT.74425.16959	The first attack took place when a police-army convoy was hit by two roadside bombs in the mountainous region near the Pakistani-Afghani border.
SNT.74425.16960	The second bombing took place when a suicide bomber detonated in front of a police headquarters in Dera Ismail Kha killing 17 police recruits who were taking a test to join the local police force.
SNT.74425.16961	Since the Red Mosque siege began there have been 67 people killed in bombing and shooting in Pakistan.

SNT.74425.16963	In that attack three civilians were killed 39 people were wounded most of them critically.
SNT.146901.16964	According to reports, at least eighteen people were killed in Brazil in the past 24 hours, following heavy storms that led to mudslides and torrential rains.
SNT.146901.16965	Most of the deaths occurred in the Rio de Janeiro area of the country, and the local Office of Civil Defense commented that more deaths are likely as the inclement weather continues.
SNT.146901.16966	The deaths were caused mainly because some shanty-houses collapsed under rain or mud.
SNT.196414.16967	After an oil pipeline in China exploded and spilled around 1,500 tonnes of oil into the Yellow Sea near the city of Dalian, the government has launched a cleanup operation consisting of more than 800 vessels.
SNT.196414.16968	The spill occurred on Friday, after a pipeline at the port exploded.
SNT.196414.16969	The oil terminal at the port has been closed ever since.
SNT.196414.16970	Authorities have been using 24 ships designed for cleaning up oil, and today ordered around 800 civilian fishing boats to join the operation.
SNT.196414.16971	The spill has been halted, although an oil slick which measured 50 square kilometers at its height remains in the harbor, and ships are using absorbent foam to remove oil from the water, as well as barriers to keep oil from reaching the shore.
SNT.196414.16972	Despite their efforts, parts of the coast reportedly have a slick of oil evident on beaches and rocks.
SNT.196414.16973	Although rough seas have affected the cleanup, authorities expect to have completed the operations within ten days.
SNT.196414.16974	According to domestic media, concerns over safety at the port have been raised in the past; a government study in 2006 noted that five projects at the port were at risk of accidents.
SNT.196414.16975	The spill has caused ongoing disruptions to the port's operations, with several ships, including six oil tankers carrying a total of around twelve million barrels of oil, having been diverted to other ports both in China and other countries.
SNT.4770.16976	Australia has defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in the one off Twenty20 international match at Eden Park.
SNT.4770.16977	This victory, in the first full international Twenty20 match, gave Australia a unique treble having won the first ever test match and then the first ever limited overs international.
SNT.4770.16978	Batting first, Australia set a total of 214, with Australian captain Ricky Ponting top scoring with 98 runs from 55 balls, including 8 fours and 5 sixes.

SNT.4770.16981	Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz finished the match with figures of 4 for 29 from his 4 overs.
SNT.4770.16982	The New Zealand team had dressed in the 1980s beige uniform for the occasion.
SNT.4770.16983	Many had also grown facial hair suiting the 1980s for the match.
SNT.4770.16984	The teams now go on to play a one-day series followed by a test match series.
SNT.91780.16985	Snow has fallen in Baghdad, Iraq for the first time in approximately 100 years.
SNT.91780.16986	Although Baghdad sometimes sees hail and sleet, snow has never been seen in living memory.
SNT.91780.16987	Snow was also recorded in the western and central parts of the country, where it is also very unusual, and in the Kurdish north, which is mountainous and commonly sees snowfall.
SNT.91780.16988	A statement by the meteorology department read "Snow has fallen in Baghdad for the first time in about a century as a result of two air flows meeting."
SNT.91780.16989	"The first one was cold and dry and the second one was warm and humid."
SNT.91780.16990	Dawood Shakir, director of the meteorology department, told AFP his take on the causation of the snow: "It's very rare."
SNT.91780.16991	"These snowfalls are linked to the climate change that is happening everywhere."
SNT.91780.16992	"We are finding some places in the world which are warm and are supposed to be cold."
SNT.91780.16993	Temperatures in some parts of the country fell below freezing, compared to winters that are normally mild in a climate that sees summer temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
SNT.91780.16994	Snow fell in the capital city from prior to dawn until just after 9 a.m. local time.
SNT.91780.16995	The flakes failed to provide a covering of snow, instead melting quickly.
SNT.91780.16996	However, many local people still had positive things to say about the once in a lifetime event.
SNT.91780.16997	Mohammed Abdul-Hussein, a 63-year-old in retirement, commented "For the first time in my life I saw a snow-rain like this falling in Baghdad."
SNT.91780.16998	"When I was young, I heard from my father that such rain had fallen in the early '40s on the outskirts of northern Baghdad but snow falling in Baghdad in such a magnificent scene was beyond my imagination."
SNT.91780.16999	Fawzi Karim, who runs a small restaurant in Hawr Rajab, six miles from Baghdad said "I asked my mother, who is 80, whether she'd ever seen snow in Iraq before, and her answer was no…"
SNT.91780.17000	"This is so unusual, and I don't know whether or not it's a lesson from God," while college student Talib Haider said "a friend of mine called me at 8 a.m. to wake me up and tell me that the sky is raining snow."
SNT.91780.17001	"I rushed quickly to the balcony to see a very beautiful scene."
SNT.91780.17002	"I tried to film it with my cell phone camera."
SNT.91780.17003	"I called my other friends and the morning turned out to be a very happy one in my life."
SNT.91780.17004	Resident Aysar Khaled told Reuters "I woke up and I saw snow falling, so I woke up all the family and told them to come and see the snowfall."
SNT.91780.17005	"Everyone in Baghdad is delighted because this is a new thing, this is the first time that it snows in Baghdad…"
SNT.91780.17006	Some viewed it as a sign of impending peace, or at least of an improving situation in the war-torn country.
SNT.91780.17007	Hassan Zahar, a 60-year-old resident, said "It is the first time we've seen snow in Baghdad."
SNT.91780.17008	"I looked at the faces of all the people, they were astonished…"
SNT.91780.17009	"I invite all the people to enjoy peace, because the snow means peace."
SNT.91780.17010	The snow was "a new sign of the new Iraq," according to traffic policeman Murtadha Fadhil, who spoke to Reuters whilst sheltering under a balcony.
SNT.91780.17011	"We hope Iraqis will purify their hearts and politicians will work for the prosperity of all Iraqis."
SNT.91780.17012	There are no reports of any bloodshed during the time the snow was falling.
SNT.249211.17013	According to Forbes annual World's Billionaire list released yesterday, Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim is the world's richest person for the second year in a row, with a net worth of US$74 billion.
SNT.249211.17014	American Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp, is again listed in second place with US$56 billion while investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway is third.
SNT.249211.17015	China added the most new billionaires to the list with 54 while Russia added 31.
SNT.249211.17016	The US came in third, with 23 new billionaires; American Mark Zuckerberg, chairman of Facebook, more than tripled his net worth to US$13.5 billion, placing him in Forbes' 52nd spot.
SNT.249211.17017	Although the US is home to 413 billionaires, more than any other country, the changing distribution of global finances is evident.
SNT.249211.17018	Today, due to the increasing wealth of emerging nations, just one in every three billionaires is American, a decline from ten years ago when Americans numbered one in every two.
SNT.249211.17019	Brazil, Russia, India and China together accounted for more than 108 new billionaires.
SNT.249211.17020	Last year, New York was home to more billionaires than any other city in the world, while this year Moscow is home to 79, which beats New York's current number of 58.
SNT.249211.17021	Forbes lists a world total of 1,210 billionaires whose combined wealth is US$4.5 trillion, an increase from last year's total of US$3.6 trillion.
SNT.143949.17022	Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived today in Cambodia where he will take up a post as the government's economic advisor.
SNT.143949.17023	The appointment has caused a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as Shinawatra was condemned to two years in jail in absentia for corruption.
SNT.143949.17024	Tension is already mounting, with the Thai government expressing both anger and embarrassment over the appointment.
SNT.143949.17025	They have withdrawn their ambassador and have decided to cancel plans with the Cambodian government for trade and oil exploration.
SNT.143949.17026	This comes amidst disputes over the Preah Vihear temple complex which spans both countries.
SNT.143949.17027	Thailand has further threatened to close borders with its neighbour.
SNT.143949.17028	Thaksin will address 300 Cambodian economics experts on Thursday in Phnom Penh and is expected to remain "two or three days" according to Cambodian cabinet spokesman Phay Siphan.
SNT.143949.17029	"It is an honour for Cambodia's economic sector and we hope that Cambodians nationwide welcome him warmly," he announced.
SNT.143949.17030	"We are looking forward to learning from Thaksin's great economic experience and we are convinced that his experience will contribute to our country's economic development," he said.
SNT.143949.17031	A coup in 2006 ousted Thaksin after members of parliament defected during military rule.
SNT.143949.17032	Since then he has been in exile, mostly living in Dubai.
SNT.143949.17033	He is still influential in Thailand, using protests by the Red Shirts, and the Thai government fears that Thaksin will use Cambodia as base to campaign.
SNT.143949.17034	However, Thaksin published a letter on his website on Monday indicating that he did not intend to "go to Cambodia to help Cambodia fight with Thailand [...]"
SNT.143949.17035	"As I travel to Cambodia to discuss poverty and the world economic situation, I will try to preserve Thai interests with our friends in Phnom Penh, despite the Thai government still hounding me wherever I go," he stated.
SNT.51208.17036	A Canadian NATO soldier was killed today in Afghanistan by a bomb while on patrol in Panjwaii district, west of Kandahar on foot.
SNT.51208.17037	Military officials have not yet released the name of the soldier.
SNT.51208.17038	His remains were taken by a helicopter to the Kandahar Airfield.
SNT.51208.17039	One soldier from Hamilton, Ontario was reported to have suffered minor hearing loss as a result of the blast.
SNT.51208.17040	Earlier today at 12 p.m., there was a rally called Red Friday for the Canadian troops in Afghanistan held in the Younge-Dundas Square in Toronto, Ontario.
SNT.51208.17041	Many in Toronto wore red in support for the troops.
SNT.51208.17042	It was announced at the rally that the Canadian soldier was killed by a bomb.
SNT.5794.17043	Wikibooks, an Internet project which seeks to create free content textbooks using wiki technology, has published its February 2005 statistics.
SNT.5794.17044	The Cookbook project leads the statistics, both by number of contributors (94) and by total edits (668).
SNT.5794.17045	Newcomer of the month is "Wikibooks Pokédex", with 337 edits by mainly one user, followed by "Programming:Ada" (320 edits).
SNT.5794.17046	Seventy contributors edited on "Wikiversity", followed by sixty-eight users on the "Jokebook".
SNT.5794.17047	Wikiversity is a project of its own which aims to build a collaborative learning environment online.
SNT.5794.17048	Wikibooks was originally meant as a place for textbooks and manuals but has increasingly become a community creating books on all kinds of subjects, with the cookbook being the most prominent example.
SNT.5794.17049	Intended as a collection of recipes from around the world, it hosts recipes from Hamburger to Sushi, ethnic cuisines from the Caribbean to the Mediterranean, and gives background information on ingredients, nutrition, and many cooking techniques.
SNT.5794.17050	Wikis are openly editable websites that are often used to create knowledge bases.
SNT.5794.17051	Wikibooks is a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization based in the United States which runs several free content wikis, including Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia, and Wikinews, a free news source.
SNT.5794.17052	The statistics for Wikibooks are extracted using an SQL query on the latest Wikibooks database dump.
SNT.71416.17053	Dark Floors, a horror film under production in Northern Finland and starring the hard rock band Lordi (who are famed for their monster costumes and lyrical themes), has received €300,000 (£200,000) funding from the Finnish government.
SNT.71416.17054	Lordi are also famed for their record-breaking 292 point victory in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with their song Hard Rock Hallelujah.
SNT.71416.17055	It was also the first time a hard rock song had won the contest, and Finland's first ever victory.
SNT.71416.17056	The film is being shot in English, with a largely Finnish cast, and has a production cost of €4.2 million (£2.84 million).
SNT.71416.17057	The plot features a "monster attack" on the world, with a young Autistic girl being the only person in a position to save it.
SNT.71416.17058	Lead singer Mr Lordi said that as their masks and costumes were derived from horror films it was "kind of natural" that they should make their own.
SNT.117461.17059	According to a French journalist and the imam of the local mosque, around 400 people have been killed in the riots that erupted due to a dispute in the result of the local elections.
SNT.117461.17060	The riots are taking place in the Nigerian city of Jos, which is located between the Christian and Muslim areas of Nigeria.
SNT.117461.17061	The elections which sparked the violence, did, according to a rumor spread around the city, result in the predominantly Christian People's Democratic Party beating the All Nigerian Peoples Party, a predominantly Muslim party.
SNT.117461.17062	Khaled Abubakar, the imam of the city's central mosque, made an estimate of the death toll.
SNT.117461.17063	"So far about 400 bodies have been brought to the mosque following the outbreak of violence," he stated.
SNT.117461.17064	"Families are coming to identify and claim the bodies, while those that cannot be identified or are not claimed by anybody will be interred by the mosque."
SNT.117461.17065	A French journalist confirmed the reports of Abubakar, despite the fact that early reports showed only twenty deaths.
SNT.117461.17066	Yakumu Pam, a Christian clergyman in Jos, also commented on the chaos.
SNT.117461.17067	"Hundreds of people have been killed in the last two days since the riots started," he stated.
SNT.117461.17068	"Remains of burned bodies litter some parts of the town."
SNT.117461.17069	In an effort to stop the fighting, the army has been ordered to open fire on people, and to create a buffer zone between the Christians and the Muslims.
SNT.117461.17070	Umaru Yar'Adua, the President of Nigeria, has stated that he is "very sad" about the ongoing violence.
SNT.85682.17071	Scott McClellan, a former White House Press Secretary, says in a new book that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Karl Rove, misled McClellan about the Plame leak, leading him to publicly exonerate Rove and Lewis "Scooter" Libby.
SNT.85682.17072	"And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so: Rove, Libby, the vice president, the president's chief of staff, and the president himself," says McClellan in a excerpt of the book that was released to the public.
SNT.85682.17073	In an interview with CNN, earlier this year, McClellan said his statements were what he "believed to be true at the time based on assurances that we were both given."
SNT.85682.17074	At that time he gave no indication that Bush was involved with or even knew that Rove or Libby were involved with the leak.
SNT.85682.17075	The current White House Press Secretary, Dana Perino, said, when asked about it today, that it is not clear what McClellan means in the excerpt.
SNT.85682.17076	"The President has not and would not ask his spokespeople to pass on false information," she said.
SNT.85682.17077	"Just when you think the credibility of this White House can't get any lower, another shoe drops," said Senator Chuck Schumer, of New York.
SNT.85682.17078	"If the Bush administration won't even tell the truth to its official spokesman, how can the American people expect to be told the truth either?"
SNT.18633.17079	Cindy Sheehan, the grieving mother of a fallen soldier in Iraq, has gained national attention for her efforts to demand the President of the United States speak with her personally.
SNT.18633.17080	"What I want to ask is, 'What noble cause did my son die for?'"
SNT.18633.17080-1	"And if he says that it was to get rid of Saddam or liberate the Iraqi people, I'm not going to buy it."
SNT.18633.17081	Prompted by President George W. Bush's announcement that Americans in Iraq have died for a 'noble cause', Sheehan has been camping near Bush's Texas ranch for the past week to demand a private conversation with the President.
SNT.18633.17082	"I don't want comfort," she told Cox Newspapers, "I want the truth."
SNT.18633.17083	Mr. Bush said he was aware of the pleas of the grieving mothers, "But whether it be here or in Washington or anywhere else, there's somebody who has got something to say to the President, that's part of the job.
SNT.18633.17084	"And I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say."
SNT.18633.17085	"But I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life."
SNT.18633.17086	Cindy has been joined in Crawford by hundreds of supporters, including many other mothers of fallen soldiers, who are camping out with her and joining her in calling "for the truth" about why their sons had to die.
SNT.18633.17087	Rallies of support are also taking place and being scheduled across the nation, and contributions from citizens across the world are flowing into the "Peace House", a nearby cottage providing shelter and support for the mothers.
SNT.18633.17088	Casey's grandparents and other members of her extended family issued a statement emailed to the Drudge Report website, which reveals their disagreement with the actions and statements that Mrs. Sheehan has made and accuses her of using her son's death to promote a personal agenda:
SNT.18633.17089	:The Sheehan Family lost our beloved Casey in the Iraq War and we have been silently, respectfully grieving.
SNT.18633.17090	We do not agree with the political motivations and publicity tactics of Cindy Sheehan.
SNT.18633.17091	She now appears to be promoting her own personal agenda and notoriety at the expense of her son's good name and reputation.
SNT.18633.17092	The rest of the Sheehan Family supports the troops, our country, and our President, silently, with prayer and respect.
SNT.18633.17093	Mrs. Sheehan has responded by saying that political views within her extended family have always been diverse, but she is happy that her husband and children share her views and are supporting her efforts.
SNT.18633.17094	She says her husband Pat, couldn't bear having Casey's things at home and put most of them in storage.
SNT.18633.17095	Mrs. Sheehan and her husband were part of a group that met with the President following her son's death last year; a meeting that President Bush began with what she thought was an insultingly insensitive greeting; "Who we'all gonna honor today."
SNT.18633.17096	Mrs. Sheehan says she had mixed feelings about Bush's demeanor at the meeting, but kept quiet.
SNT.18633.17097	When more information came out about the planning for the war, however, she started to feel utterly betrayed.
SNT.18633.17098	"I want the kind of meeting that holds him accountable for the words he's actually said.", Sheehan told Time magazine reporters.
SNT.14879.17099	The UK Secretary of State for Defence John Reid has admitted the withdrawal of 5,500 of the 8,500 British troops in Iraq by spring 2006 is a possibility.
SNT.14879.17100	It comes after a report was leaked to the Mail on Sunday in the aftermath of the 7 July London bombings.
SNT.14879.17101	The document (Options for Future UK Force Posture in Iraq) was marked "Secret - UK eyes only" and also contained information on possible U.S. troop reductions, bringing the number of Coalition forces in Iraq down to 66,000.
SNT.14879.17102	About 176,000 Coalition troops are presently in Iraq, 130,000 of which are from the United States Armed Forces.
SNT.14879.17103	However, the document also reveals there is division between the Pentagon, which apparently favours a "relatively bold reduction", and U.S. commanders in Iraq who are more cautious.
SNT.14879.17104	The British Army is the lead component of the Multi-National Division (South-East).
SNT.14879.17105	It has maintained forces in the 8,000+ region since the end of the 2003 Iraq War.
SNT.14879.17106	In the document, Mr Reid admitted that a large reduction of British and U.S. forces would make it difficult for other countries to keep their force in Iraq.
SNT.14879.17107	Mr Reid, who took up the position of Secretary of State for Defence on 6 May 2005, admitted that the document was made by him for Prime Minister Tony Blair.
SNT.14879.17108	In the document, Mr Reid stated that a decision would need to be made later this year on British forces levels in Iraq.
SNT.14879.17109	The possible transfer of control of Al Muthanna and Maysan provinces, followed by Al Basrah and Dhi Qar provinces in 2006, were also included in the document.
SNT.14879.17110	It estimated the reduction of British forces could save about £1 billion pounds (about $1.7 billion U.S. dollars).
SNT.14879.17111	In a statement on 10 July made in response to the leaking of the document, Mr Reid denied that the document signalled any change in policy, stating that, "No decisions on the future force posture of UK forces have been taken."
SNT.14879.17112	"But we have always said that it is our intention to hand over the lead in fighting terrorists to Iraqi security forces as their capability increases."
SNT.14879.17113	"We therefore continually produce papers outlining possible options and contingencies."
SNT.14879.17114	On 4 July, during a debate in the House of Commons, Mr Reid had hinted at possible reductions in forces, saying that, "By and large, about 12 [of 18] of the provinces are relatively free of terrorist attacks."
SNT.14879.17115	"As the Iraqi forces become trained to take the lead, it is possible, over a period of time, to hand the lead role to Iraqi forces in certain areas of the country and gradually, we hope, over the whole country."
SNT.14879.17116	A spokesperson of the MND (SE) was questioned by a Wikireporter.
SNT.14879.17117	When asked whether speculation of reductions would affect British forces morale in Iraq, it was insisted that, "The British forces will continue to operate in the professional manner to which they always have done."
SNT.14879.17118	The spokesperson added, "No decision on the future posture of UK forces in Iraq has been taken."
SNT.14879.17119	"Assisting the Iraqis to improve the security environment remains our top priority."
SNT.14879.17120	Speaking of the response by Iraqis to the London bombings, the spokesperson said, "Most of the feed back from Friday pray[ers] in the British Area of Operation were against the attacks on London."
SNT.7540.17121	April 7, 2005 ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings was diagnosed this week with lung cancer.
SNT.7540.17122	Despite beginning out-patient treatment next week which will involve chemotherapy, Jennings will continue to front ABC's 'World News Tonight' show, "to the extent he can do so comfortably", says ABC News.
SNT.7540.17123	"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer," Jennings told ABC staff on Tuesday.
SNT.7540.17124	"I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."
SNT.7540.17125	The 66-year-old anchor man, who gave up smoking several years ago, added: "I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value deeply the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work."
SNT.7540.17126	Jennings began his career at ABC News in 1964 and in 1983 was made senior editor and anchor of World News Tonight.
SNT.7540.17127	Due to ill health, he was unable to work during his network's special report on the recent death of Pope John Paul II.
SNT.143783.17128	Pakistani officials have said that a suicide bomber struck a crowded market today in northwest Pakistan, killing an anti-Taliban mayor.
SNT.143783.17129	At least eleven other people were killed in the blast, and dozens were wounded.
SNT.143783.17130	Initially, Mayor Abdul Malik was reported to have survived the attack in the Matni area on the outskirts of the city of Peshawar.
SNT.143783.17131	The market was crowded with shoppers ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid.
SNT.143783.17132	Officials said that Malik, a former Taliban supporter, had switched sides and raised a militia to fight the Taliban.
SNT.143783.17133	He had survived several attempts on his life since shifting his allegiance.
SNT.143783.17134	"Malik had survived several attacks on his life in the recent past, since he turned against the militants," said the top Peshawar official, Sahibzada Anis.
SNT.124294.17135	The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) reported today a "significant explosive event" had occurred at Mount Redoubt in Alaska.
SNT.124294.17136	Lightning was observed within an ash cloud that formed over the volcano.
SNT.124294.17137	As a result the AVO raised the alert level to 'warning' and level 'red' for aviation.
SNT.124294.17138	According to the Observatory, seismic activity caused a major lahar, similar to a mudslide or landslide, to occur in the Drift River Valley.
SNT.124294.17139	Inhabitants of the Valley were advised to seek high ground and take immediate precautions against flooding.
SNT.124294.17140	So far there are no reports of injuries or evacuations.
SNT.124294.17141	Wikinews has e-mailed the AVO for a statement regarding the event, but has yet to receive a reply.
SNT.124294.17142	"Strong, but diminishing seismic activity is continuing as of 07:35 AKDT," said the AVO on its website.
SNT.124294.17143	At 9:18 a.m., the AVO reported that the event had ended.
SNT.124294.17144	"Continuing seismic activity and web camera images indicate that low level emissions of steam, gas, and some volcanic ash are continuing to be emitted at the volcano at altitudes of [20,000 feet]."
SNT.124294.17145	The AVO is sending a team to investigate the latest eruption which will include a fly-over to take readings on the gases being emitted.
SNT.124294.17146	The explosion sent volcanic ash which spread to "Homer, Anchor Point, and Seldovia" to an altitude of over 50,000 feet.
SNT.124294.17147	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued an advisory stating that ash fall can be expected from "Ninilchik Southward through mid morning."
SNT.124294.17148	The advisory is scheduled to end at 10:00 a.m. (AKDT).
SNT.124294.17149	As a result of recent eruptions at Redoubt, half of the 6 million gallons of crude oil stored in the Drift Valley will be removed to a safer location.
SNT.124294.17150	There is no word on when the move will take place.
SNT.124294.17151	The storage facility is located just 22 miles from Redoubt.
SNT.99740.17152	Two recent polls have shown that the residents of the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, England would prefer to live in Scotland.
SNT.99740.17153	Located 57 miles from Edinburgh, Scotland and over 300 miles from London, Berwick was a frequent bone of contention in the border wars between the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland, changing hands at least 13 times between 1147 and 1482.
SNT.99740.17154	Under the Treaty of Perpetual Peace agreed in 1502 by the English King Henry VII and the Scottish King James IV, Berwick was declared to be "of the Kingdom of England but not in it".
SNT.99740.17155	This resulted in Berwick having to be named individually in legislation until the British Parliament passed the Wales and Berwick Act in 1746 which stated that unless specially specified otherwise, the term "England" in laws included Berwick and Wales; in 1853 the declaration of war on Russia specifically mentioned Berwick, but the 1856 Treaty of Paris did not, leading to the urban legend that the town was still at war with Russia until the Mayor signed a peace treaty with a Soviet diplomat in 1966.
SNT.99740.17156	Since the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Berwickers have noted that Scottish residents receive about £1500 more government expenditure each year than English residents, including free care for elderly people and free university tuition, both of which have to be paid for in England.

SNT.99740.17161	But it's clear most people in Berwick would rather be part of SNP-governed Scotland than Labour-run England."

SNT.74034.17317	The review, to take place in September, will look at "whether regeneration in the areas for the super-casinos may be a better way of meeting their economic and social needs than the creation of super-casinos".

SNT.183104.17339	Russian president Dmitriy Medvedev met with the Khaled Meshaal, leader of the Hamas group, earlier this week in Syria, prompting criticism from Israel.
SNT.183104.17340	Medvedev, during the meeting, had encouraged Hamas to reconciliate with rival Fatah; a spokeswoman quoted him as saying that "no one" should be left out of the peace process.
SNT.183104.17341	He also requested that an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in 2006, Gilad Shalit, be released, although this was refused by Hamas, who says that Shalit wouldn't be released unless there was an "honourable" prisoner exchange with Israel.
SNT.183104.17342	Shortly before his conversation with Meshaal, Medvedev also held a meeting with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
SNT.183104.17343	A statement by the Israeli foreign ministry read: "Hamas is a terror organization whose declared goal is the destruction of the state of Israel.
SNT.183104.17344	Hamas is responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent civilians, among them immigrants from the Soviet Union and also Russian citizens.
SNT.183104.17345	"Israel has always stood by Russia in its struggle against the Chechnyan terrorism.
SNT.183104.17346	We expect the same attitude when we are talking about the Hamas terrorism against Israel."
SNT.183104.17347	Ha'aretz, an Israeli newspaper, described the meeting as being "a surprise" for the country.
SNT.183104.17348	Andrei Nesterenko, a spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, responded to Israel's comments, saying: "Hamas is not an artificial structure.
SNT.183104.17349	It is a movement that draws on the trust and sympathy of a large number of Palestinians.
SNT.183104.17350	"It is known that all other participants of the Middle East quartet are also in some sort of contact with Hamas leadership, although for some unknown reason they are shy to publicly admit it."
SNT.183104.17351	Only a few countries in Europe, including Russia, maintain ties with Hamas; the European Union and the United States regard it as a terrorist organisation.
SNT.55385.17352	Former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach Pat Dobson died of leukemia Wednesday, November 22.

SNT.55984.17358	United States Senator Hillary Clinton has been holding discussions about and interviewing potential campaign staff for a White House bid in 2008.
SNT.55984.17359	Clinton met with Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer Sunday about support if she chooses to run.
SNT.55984.17360	"She said before the election that after the election she would be considering a presidential run," said senior Clinton advisor Howard Wolfson.
SNT.55984.17361	"Part of that process is seeking the advice and counsel of her colleagues in New York."
SNT.55984.17362	One New York Democrat, who asked to not be named, said he was recently called by a senior Clinton team member.
SNT.55984.17363	While it was not said that Clinton had chosen to run for president, "it was pretty clear."
SNT.55984.17364	New York senior Senator Charles Schumer, Clinton's Democratic colleague, told Associated Press (AP) he would be meeting with Clinton in the next week.
SNT.55984.17365	"She wants to sit down and talk next week, which we're going to do.
SNT.55984.17366	I have no idea what it's about, and until we sit down and talk that's all I'm going to say about it.
SNT.55984.17367	I think she'd make a very good president but let's wait and see.
SNT.55984.17368	Last week, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack announced he would seek the Democratic nomination.
SNT.55984.17369	Indiana Democrat Senator Evan Bayh announced Sunday he is considering running for the White House.
SNT.55984.17370	Clinton tops every national poll of likely Democratic candidates and had tried to keep private many of her overtures to supporters and new staff.
SNT.55984.17371	The deliberations have started to become more public in the last week as the field of likely contenders has begun to expand.
SNT.55984.17372	Illinois Senator Barack Obama, has attracted tremendous publicity around a possible run without committing himself.
SNT.55984.17373	He has jumped to second place behind Clinton in many polls.
SNT.55984.17374	Obama's emergence as a potential contender has led some observers to suspect Clinton has stepped up her timetable for making a decision about a run.
SNT.55984.17375	Her aides dismiss that notion, saying she is observing the timetable she has long planned.
SNT.55984.17376	Other likely candidates include 2004 nominee Senator John Kerry; his vice presidential running mate, former North Carolina Senator John Edwards; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and Senators Joe Biden of Delaware and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut.

SNT.23576.17384	The British Assets Recovery Agency is investigating £30 million / €44 million of assets believed to be owned by senior members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA or IRA), using information provided by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau and British and Irish law enforcement agencies.
SNT.23576.17385	The money is believed to represent a small fraction of the wealth obtained by the organisation.
SNT.23576.17386	Most of the assets are believed to have been owned by the IRA chief of staff, Thomas Murphy and businessman Dermot Craven.
SNT.23576.17387	Now that negotiations over weapons decommissioning are over, it is believed that other IRA members who have become rich through running protection rackets or other criminal activities may also be stripped of their illegal assests in the forthcoming weeks.
SNT.23576.17388	Businesses and organisations paying money towards protection rackets are hoping that the structure of the IRA will now begin to unravel.
SNT.39860.17389	Rescuers are continuing their efforts to reach the trapped miners in the Beaconsfield mine in northern Tasmania.
SNT.39860.17390	A five tonne borer drilling machine has been secured in place to drill a one metre hole through the remaining 12-16 metres of rock that fell into the main shaft.
SNT.39860.17391	Since drilling began at 7pm last night, the machine has made a 2 cm wide pilot hole half way to the miners.
SNT.39860.17392	The trapped miners have been given egg sandwiches and yogurt, and have received apple ipod MP3 players filled with the miners favourite songs to pass the time and drown out the sounds of the drilling.
SNT.39860.17393	Meanwhile on the surface, the ever-growing media frenzy in Beaconsfield has forced the mine operators to enforce bag checks of rescuers entering the mine to ensure that no recording devices are taken into the mine.
SNT.83007.17394	The Saskatchewan Roughriders have won the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, Canada on Sunday after defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers by a 23-19 score.
SNT.83007.17395	Saskatchewan last won the Cup in 1989, and their last appearance at the championship game was in 1997 against the Toronto Argonauts.
SNT.83007.17396	The Canadian Football League (CFL) championship game was held at Toronto's Rogers Centre before a crowd of 52,230.
SNT.83007.17397	This is the first time these two western Canadian teams have met in a Grey Cup final.
SNT.83007.17398	Despite Winnipeg's lead during the first and third quarters, Saskatchewan's offence proved too strong for the Blue Bombers in the end.
SNT.83007.17399	A half-time performance by rock musician Lenny Kravitz included the song "American Woman", originally performed by Winnipeg band The Guess Who.
SNT.83007.17400	On Thursday, Saskatchewan quarterback Kerry Joseph was declared this year's CFL Outstanding Player at a player awards ceremony in Toronto.
SNT.83007.17401	The Cup is named after Earl Grey who donated the trophy to honour Canada's most successful amateur rugby team.
SNT.83007.17402	By the time the Canadian Football League was formed in 1958, the Cup became the top prize for professional football in Canada.
SNT.83007.17403	Next year's CFL championship game is scheduled at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.
SNT.46447.17404	Resulting from the Israeli bombings on July 13 and 15, 2006 of the Jiyeh power station, located on the coast 30 kilometers south of Beirut, Lebanon, approximately 35,000 tons of heavy fuel oil have spilled into the Mediterranean Sea.
SNT.46447.17405	The Lebanese Ministry of Environment expects additional tonnage to flow into the sea as a result of the damage.
SNT.46447.17406	For comparison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill released nearly 40,000 tons.
SNT.46447.17407	According to Berj Hatjian from the Lebanon Ministry of Environment, "What we have here is equivalent to a tanker sinking, and 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes reaching the shoreline."
SNT.46447.17408	Furthermore, several storage tanks caught fire due to the blast of the bombardment and continued to burn uncontrollably for 10 days after.
SNT.46447.17409	Wind and water currents have spread the oil slick across 70-80 kilometers of Lebanon coastline.
SNT.7557.17410	April 7, 2005 The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the building of a new $1.5 billion "skyway" portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, according to a report published in the Oakland Tribune.
SNT.7557.17411	The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island.
SNT.7557.17412	The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities they were pressured – and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 – for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster.
SNT.7557.17413	But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined the work, although rushed, met safety standards.
SNT.7557.17414	"We've got good welds, good procedures and everything is in place to have a quality product.
SNT.7557.17415	If a defect got in, we can't find it," Pete Siegenthaler, Caltrans project manager told the Tribune in an interview.
SNT.7557.17416	A KFM spokesman told the Tribune that the welds are in "compliance with stringent Caltrans specifications."
SNT.7557.17417	According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter.
SNT.7557.17418	The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was spent during its construction.
SNT.7557.17419	If questionable welds are found in the support piers, according to reports, much of the new construction may have to be torn down to be rebuilt.
SNT.7557.17420	The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
SNT.7557.17421	At $6.2 billion total, the new bridge qualifies as the largest public works project in California's history.
SNT.51999.17422	The New Zealand A1GP team, with racer Jonny Reid, placed seventh in A1GP feature race and picked up four championship points in the second round at Brno track, Czech Republic.
SNT.51999.17423	New Zealand managed to secure themselves first place in the qualifying race by being fastest in all four qualifying segments with a time of 3:30.053, Germany second with 3:30.524.
SNT.51999.17424	This put New Zealand in the pole position to start the sprint race.
SNT.51999.17425	When racing for the 20 minute sprint race started Germany and New Zealand 'locked horns' before the very first corner.
SNT.51999.17426	It ended with both cars crashing out of the race.
SNT.51999.17427	This crash made both New Zealand and Germany start from the end of the track for the feature race.
SNT.51999.17428	New Zealand managed to crawl their way back to get seventh place, but dropped to fourteenth place from twelfth, out of 23 competing nations, on the leader board with only five points.
SNT.51999.17429	David Sears, Engineering Team Director for both Germany and New Zealand, said: "Reid and his German counterpart Nico Hülkenberg were warned about keeping apart...but still ended up making life difficult for themselves."
SNT.51999.17430	Sears added: "To finish first you must first finish and the track is incredibly wide here at Brno, so why New Zealand and Germany should be rubbing wheels on the very first corner is anyone's guess.
SNT.51999.17431	To recover and finish strongly was encouraging for Jonny and the car certainly has the raw speed and looks to be one of the quickest going around.
SNT.51999.17432	That's the pleasing part amid the disappointment and we now need to refocus and prepare for the next month's round in China."
SNT.51999.17433	"We were so much quicker than the other teams in qualifying that it would be criminal to be banging wheels when a great result is there for the taking."
SNT.51999.17434	The next A1GP race takes place on November 12 in Beijing.
SNT.30978.17435	A U.S. F-15 fighter aircraft crashed into the ocean early Tuesday approximately 45 miles off the coast of Ikeijima island, part of the Okinawa chain.
SNT.30978.17436	The pilot, whose name was not released, ejected safely and was rescued.
SNT.53726.17437	The New Zealand Medical Association (NZMA) has warned the public against taking party pills, even though they are legal in New Zealand.
SNT.53726.17438	This warning comes because Benzylpiperazine, or BZP, can trigger hypothermia, seizures, paranoia, insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations and spasms of the muscle.
SNT.53726.17439	Some of those side effects will occur if the person has taken 4.5 tablets.
SNT.53726.17440	Those who do take party pills should not mix them with medication, drugs or alcohol.
SNT.53726.17441	Also those with mental illnesses are advised to steer clear of the pills.
SNT.53726.17442	Ross Boswell, chairman of the medical association, said: "There were growing concerns about the safety of BZP-based party pills," and the legality of the pills is coming under fire.
SNT.53726.17443	"If people insist on taking the pills, they should make sure they stick to the manufacturer's recommended dose, of one or two pills, and not combine them with other stimulants."
SNT.53726.17444	A study done at the Christchurch Hospital has shown that 61 patients had been to the emergency department a total of 80 times.
SNT.53726.17445	Of those 80 times, 15 of them were toxic seizures and two patients presented life threatening conditions.
SNT.53726.17446	The pills are often sold as "herbal highs" but according to Boswell, there is nothing "herbal" about them as they were first made to treat cattle that had worms.
SNT.53726.17447	Boswell said: "Further research on the effects of BZP is soon to be released by the Health Minister," as the New Zealand government is debating whether or not they should be banned or have their sale restricted.
SNT.107331.17448	A spiritual guru known as "Swami Amritachaitanya" is being held in Kerala, India on charges of fraud, rape and possession of narcotic drugs.
SNT.107331.17449	Swami Amritachaitanya, whose real name is Santosh Madhavan, was arrested by Interpol in March on criminal charges in a police raid at his 16-suite ashram in Kochi, India following multiple police complaints against him.
SNT.107331.17450	Indians living in Bahrain have recently come forward and filed a case against Madhavan in India on allegations of fraudulent practices related to his supposed charity activities.
SNT.107331.17451	Twenty Indians living in Bahrain filed a case against 35-year old Madhavan on Tuesday.
SNT.107331.17452	They claim they were victims of a scam after Madhavan convinced them to invest in a charitable organization and tourist resort, but allegedly kept the money for himself.
SNT.107331.17453	"Twenty of us have e-mailed a complaint to the Inspector General and Commissioner of Ernakulam police as well as Kerala Home Minister," said complainant Jaya Kumar in a statement to the Gulf Daily News.
SNT.107331.17454	Ernakulam is a district in the state of Kerala in India.
SNT.107331.17455	"He was very convincing about his charity activities as well as the resort," said Kumar, a purchasing officer at a company in Bahrain.
SNT.107331.17456	Police began an investigation into Madhavan in April after a woman filed a complaint alleging he had promised to start a business with her after a meeting in Dubai, but she said he disappeared after she gave him the money.
SNT.107331.17457	Serafin Edwin traveled to the capital of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, last week from her residence in Dubai, in order to give testimony against Madhavan.
SNT.107331.17458	She was greeted at the international airport by police, and is under police protection due to concerns for her safety.
SNT.107331.17459	Her family members told Khaleej Times that she feared physical harm from Madhavan or his henchmen.
SNT.107331.17460	Interpol has been investigating Madhavan in allegations related to his business dealings with Serafin Edwin since 2004.
SNT.107331.17461	"I am happy that the police finally caught up with him and he is in prison.
SNT.107331.17462	He is a big fraud and everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie," said Serafin Edwin in a statement to the United Arab Emirates paper The National.
SNT.107331.17463	Madhavan was arrested by Interpol police after multiple underage girls went to law enforcement with allegations of rape and sexual abuse.
SNT.107331.17464	According to Press Trust of India, police in India received complaints from three underage girls alleging he had raped them.
SNT.107331.17465	The Times reported that Madhavan is accused of making pornographic movies with underage girls, sexual assault, rape, fraud and possession of narcotics.
SNT.107331.17466	A police raid of Madhavan's four-story mansion in India uncovered drugs, a police uniform, a pelt from an endangered tiger and pornographic DVDs.
SNT.107331.17467	Gulf Daily News reported that Madhavan was arrested in Kerala in conjunction with an Interpol "red alert", which was issued after consultation with Dubai police in 2004.
SNT.107331.17468	Self styled "godmen" and "gurus" are under increased observation by police in India following the arrest of Madhavan, and police are specifically investigating their sources of wealth and possible fraud.
SNT.107331.17469	But we won’t allow illegal activities under the guise of spirituality," said Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in a statement to Howrah News Service.
SNT.107331.17470	G. Sudhakaran, Kerala's minister for temples, presented a different viewpoint in a statement to The Times.
SNT.107331.17471	"They’re conducting all kinds of criminal and material activities behind their spiritual exteriors.
SNT.107331.17472	There are so many swamis who have enlightened the hearts and minds of people, but these people are fakes with no idea about spirituality.
SNT.107331.17473	They are only interested in women and money and muscle power," said Sudhakaran.
SNT.107331.17474	Many Hindus were upset by Sudhakaran's words, as some devout Hindus consider swamis to be above the law and should not be criticized.
SNT.42680.17475	The price for a barrel of oil dropped after news broke that Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been killed in a US airstrike Thursday.
SNT.42680.17476	The death of al-Zarqawi seems to have been interpreted by the market as good news for the future supply of oil from the region.
SNT.42680.17477	This is against the backdrop in 2006 when the price of oil had reached a record high of $70 a barrel.
SNT.42680.17478	Today on the New York Mercantile Exchange light crude futures for July dropped from over $70 a barrel to a low of $69.54 before rising to $69.63 for a $1.19 loss.
SNT.42680.17479	"There's less of a terror threat in Iraq now," said Naohiro Niimura, vice president of energy derivatives at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd, in Tokyo, who gave his reason for the fall.
SNT.42680.17480	Iraq lies over one-third of known oil reserves but since the Iraq war in 2003 has been unable to pump more than 2 million barrels a day - 1 million less than prior to the coalition invasion.
SNT.42680.17481	In May exports were said to be 1.5 million bpd.
SNT.42680.17482	The line on a graph that plotted oil price had done a steady incline over recent years, though many factors are involved in the price of a barrel of oil so it is almost impossible to say how much the troubles in Iraq contributed to this rise.
SNT.42680.17483	Iraq's exports make up the largest proportion of its Gross Domestic Product and a significant proportion of world supply.
SNT.42680.17484	Investors were said to have been worried about developing in the country citing lack of security and legal protection.
SNT.42680.17485	Al-Zarqawi, known for videotaped beheadings, suicide bombing campaigns against coalition forces and civilians and reportedly some attacks on oil infrastructure inside Iraq, had claimed responsibility for bombing three hotels in Amman, Jordan.
SNT.42680.17486	It was hoped the death of Osama bin Laden's operative in Iraq would remove a man who had opposed the US-backed Shiite-led state and western influence in the wider-region.
SNT.42680.17487	The Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's recent appointment of new security and home affairs ministers also may have affected the oil market.
SNT.42680.17488	Director general of marketing and economics at the Iraqi oil ministry said both pieces of news together were "a positive indicator for security," said Shamkhi Faraj.
SNT.42680.17489	Other voices sounded a note of caution against the optimism: "The situation in Iraq has now become so chaotic, that it transcends the death of one man, influential as al-Zarqawi was," said Edward Meir.
SNT.42680.17490	The analyst at Man Financial believes the threat to the Iraqi oil industry is political as well as physical.
SNT.42680.17491	"Yes, al Qaeda attacked oil installations but they were not the only actors and they were not the main actors," he said.
SNT.42680.17492	"There is also a new factor -- political parties that are using threats against oil to gain leverage."
SNT.42680.17493	In an announcement about oil, Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih of the Iraqi government said it hoped to produce 4.3 million bpd in four years.
SNT.10749.17494	Saturday evening, at approximately 7:00 p.m. PST on Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, California, a brush fire broke out on the southwestern side of the hill.
SNT.10749.17495	Firefighters were on the scene by 8:30 p.m. with fire trucks, paramedic units, surveillance helicopters, and water-equipped helicopters.
SNT.10749.17496	Two fire trucks blasted water at the blaze from higher up on the mountain, while every minute or so, a water-equipped helicopter would swoop down over the flames and release its payload.
SNT.10749.17497	At the top of the hill, there were five fire trucks and one paramedic unit; the three main entrances to the mountain were barricaded off by fire trucks.
SNT.10749.17498	By approximately 9:15 p.m., the flame was entirely extinguished, thanks mainly to the water-equipped helicopters.

SNT.252664.17500	On Thursday, London's Mayor Boris Johnson announced the shortlist of bidders to supply up to ten further trams to Transport for London (TfL) for use on the city's Tramlink network in Croydon.
SNT.252664.17501	TfL, who purchased the Tramlink network from Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. in 2008, announced the plans late January, after submitting the tender to the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) on January 29.
SNT.252664.17502	According to the notice, the additional trams will operate approximately 75,000km per year, will be needed for "at least 10, but not more than 20 years" and can be either new build or existing vehicles that can be modified — at a reasonable cost — to run on the Tramlink infrastructure.
SNT.252664.17503	The tram fleet is currently made up of 24 Bombardier CR4000 trams, which were constructed for the opening of the 28km network between 1998 and 2000.
SNT.252664.17504	22 of these trams are currently needed to operate the three tram routes each day, and the new service is expected to require at least an additional five trams daily, bringing about the need for a boost to the fleet levels.
SNT.252664.17505	The shortlist to supply the trams consists of City of Edinburgh/CAF, Stadler (Stadler Pankow GmBH) and Pesa (Pojazdy Szynowe PESA Bydgoszcz S.A.Holding, and the the three consortia will now be invited to submit proposals to supply the additional trams.
SNT.252664.17506	It is not currently known whether the bids made by Stadler and Pesa will be for new-build or second-hand vehicles, however the bid from Edinburgh/CAF is to use a number of the currently-dormant trams that were constructed for that city's own tram network.
SNT.252664.17507	The system has had several set backs since construction began, with the network now set to open in stages with a number of tram lines (but not the trams to operate them) being cancelled, leading to a large surplus of vehicles that could be hired out in the short term.
SNT.252664.17508	The trams are amongst some of the longest and heaviest in Europe, though, and will require a large amount of modification to enable them to be able to operate on Croydon's network if the bid is successful.
SNT.252664.17509	Shortly after the announcement, whilst inspecting one of the network's current trams at East Croydon tram stop, Boris Johnson said: "I have no greater responsibility as Mayor than to ensure people can move around this city with ease, comfort and reliability.
SNT.252664.17510	"Trams in Croydon have proved a major success and this is reflected in journey numbers which have soared by 45 per cent since the network opened in 2000.
SNT.252664.17511	"I look forward to the extra vehicles developing this vital, much-appreciated, and indeed attractive, form of transport further."
SNT.252664.17512	Funding for the new trams is expected to largely come from TfL, however the London Borough of Croydon has also confirmed a £3m contribution to the project.
SNT.252664.17513	This will also include the refurbishment of tram stop surrounds.
SNT.252664.17514	Croydon Council Leader Mike Fisher said: "This is looking like a great deal for Croydon and shows the benefits of an ambitious local authority and committed Mayor working together, pooling resources and expertise.
SNT.252664.17515	"There is real support to get additional trams for Croydon to keep pace with growing demand for Tramlink services and also to secure major improvements for pedestrians and transport users around and between East and West Croydon stations."
SNT.252664.17516	TfL anticipates that, providing a successful bid is made, the new trams would be delivered to the network's depot at Therapia Lane in late 2011, with an entry into service from early 2012.
SNT.232638.17517	Three are dead after a tornado hit Cincinnati, a small town in Arkansas, about three miles from Oklahoma’s border.
SNT.232638.17518	Around 6:00 local time, on Friday, the system, fed by warm winter air, caused several injuries, damaging the power grid.
SNT.232638.17519	Josh Howerton, the county’s sheriff’s dispatcher, stated that the storm touched down near the town’s center.

SNT.203446.17528	The awards included Best Film, Best Director, and Best Music.
SNT.203446.17529	Corneau said in a 1992 interview in the New York Times that "Many people got emotional about this film, and that made it possible for it to escape cult status."
SNT.203446.17530	French President Nicolas Sarkozy commented on the death of Corneau.
SNT.203446.17531	He said "Corneau was a courageous man and a great director."

SNT.61183.17533	In Iran, the state-controlled TV station has announced that the country for the first time test-fired a space rocket, with scientific equipment aboard.
SNT.61183.17534	"The first space rocket has been successfully launched into space," the station's website reported.
SNT.61183.17535	The rocket was later reported not be designed to reach an orbit.

SNT.61183.17537	No images have been released, and no other reports have confirmed the launch.
SNT.61183.17538	The announcement comes at a time of international tension over Iran's nuclear program.
SNT.61183.17539	In a speech today, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad compared his country's nuclear program with a train with no brakes and no reverse gear.
SNT.61183.17540	Manouchehr Mohammadi, a deputy foreign minister, said the country had prepared itself for a standoff over its nuclear activities.
SNT.61183.17541	Diplomats said that if Iran would possess advanced missile capabilities it would be of concern to the nations who believe Iran is developing nuclear weapons, something Iran denies.
SNT.61183.17542	The head of the Iranian space center, Mohsen Bahrami, was quoted saying that the scientific material on board came from the science and from the defence ministry.
SNT.61183.17543	He also said that the test was in line with international regulations on the matter.
SNT.61183.17544	Although the news would mean a significant breakthrough for Iran's missile technology, the story was only mentioned during one TV broadcast, and not at all by other official Iranian media.
SNT.61183.17545	Iran has said in the past it wants more satellites to increase its cellular phone and internet capabilities.
SNT.61183.17546	It also said it hopes to become a center for science and technology in the region.
SNT.61183.17547	Since 2005, Iran already has one satellite in space, Sinah-1, which was launched in Russia with a Russian rocket.
SNT.61183.17548	The rocket was described as serving telecommunication and research purposes.
SNT.61183.17549	Soon after the 2005 launch, Iran announced they would develop their own launcher.
SNT.61183.17550	Yesterday, the Iranian Defence Minister spoke of Iran's plans for their own satellite launcher, and disclosed his country's desire to join the club of countries with a space program.
SNT.122562.17551	With an election coming up this Saturday in the Australian state of Queensland, Wikinews reporter Patrick Gillett previews the contesting parties.
SNT.122562.17552	The current distribution of seats has the Australian Labor Party with 58 of the 86 total, the Liberal National Party with 25, the Queensland Greens & One Nation with one each and independents holding four.
SNT.122562.17553	The Australian Labor Party (ALP) is currently in government and have been since 1998.
SNT.122562.17554	Current premier and leader of the ALP Anna Bligh will be, if Labor wins, the first female to elected premier in Australian history.
SNT.122562.17555	Ms Bligh became the third female premier in Australian history when Peter Beattie resigned in 2007.
SNT.122562.17556	The premier has received criticism from other parties for backflipping on its commitment to run a full term.
SNT.122562.17557	"After 11 years in office, Ms Bligh only cares about one job: her own," said Lawrence Springborg head of the Liberal National Party (LNP) and the Leader of the Opposition.
SNT.122562.17558	It is seen as a prototype for a national merger between the Liberal and National parties.
SNT.122562.17559	The Opposition need to pick up at least twenty seats from the government to overcome the significant Labor majority and a number of independents.
SNT.122562.17560	The Greens unveiled its policy to open two solar power stations on the weekend of January 31/February 1.
SNT.122562.17561	"We can tackle climate change and create long-term jobs, but Labor can't see that because they are blinded by the interests of their big donors - the urban development and coal industries," said Mt Coo-tha candidate Larrisa Waters.
SNT.122562.17562	The Greens main policies have been stated "Green collar jobs", "managing where the money is going", education and transport.
SNT.122562.17563	"The Greens want to give the community and the environment a voice back in State Parliament," says Ms Waters.
SNT.122562.17564	The Socialist Alliance will run two candidates as independents because of what they call "restrictive rules for registration."
SNT.122562.17565	The Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4EQ) party was set up in late 2008.
SNT.122562.17566	DS4SEQ leader Jason Furze gave an interview to Wikinews in January.
SNT.122562.17567	"DS4SEQ would like to gain a sizeable percentage of the primary vote and win a number of seats," Mr furze said.
SNT.122562.17568	Courier Mail writer Dennis Atkins wrote in today's Courier Mail that DS4SEQ "will poll better than anyone expected - polling close to double figures in some seats around Brisbane and on the coasts."
SNT.122562.17569	News Limited newspapers The West Australian and the Courier Mail reported that swing voters would decide the election.
SNT.165803.17570	Caloundra lead Glasshouse by 153 runs at stumps on day two of the 2010 Sunshine Coast, Australia division one cricket grand final.
SNT.165803.17571	"I think the nerves of a grand final gets to you too.
SNT.165803.17572	You try and put it in the back of your mind but it’s still there,” Glasshouse captain Brett Milini said.
SNT.165803.17573	Caloundra were all out in their first inning for 193.
SNT.165803.17574	I thought 250 was a par score and I thought we were in with a big chance,” Milini said.
SNT.165803.17575	"If we were good enough, we should have got that pretty easy but we didn’t bat well today."
SNT.165803.17576	Caloundra rounded out day two at six out for fifty seven, leaving Glasshouse an outside chance of snatching the championship.
SNT.165803.17577	“We’ve given ourselves another chance but if we bat like we did in the first innings, we’re already gone,” he said.
SNT.165803.17578-1	“It should be a real good game, it’s interesting cricket.”
SNT.165803.17578-2	 Results for the second division, third B division, southern fourth division and fifth division traditional grand finals have not been accessible to Wikinews as of this report
SNT.79147.17579	A minimum of 85 Hindu pilgrims have been killed in India and 64 injured after their lorry and trailer plunged 24m (80ft) into a river gorge late last night.
SNT.79147.17580	Approximately 150 people were on board when the driver lost control on a sharp bend near the village of Nagbavji, Rajasthan, smashing through a concrete crash barrier and continuing down into the valley, coming to rest inverted.
SNT.79147.17581	An overnight rescue operation was initiated, removing both survivors and bodies of the dead from the wreck, with the aid of cranes and spotlights.
SNT.79147.17582	Ambulances and medical teams rushed to the scene from surrounding areas.
SNT.79147.17583	Of the 64 who were hospitalised, three are reported to be in critical condition.
SNT.79147.17584	The Press Trust of India reported that as many as 130 were injured, and Al Jazeera reported that there may have been 200 people on board.
SNT.79147.17585	It is believed the death toll could rise still further, as many people remain trapped beneath the trailer.
SNT.79147.17586	The truck was a 12-wheeled model designed for hauling shipping containers, and was carrying pilgrims from three nearby villages Shiwal, Madri and Bhawa.
SNT.79147.17587	The driver had offered to take them to their destination for free, a practise common in India, despite the fact that such trucks are not safe for passenger transport, being designed primarily as freight transporters.
SNT.79147.17588	The vehicle had been destined for the temple of Ramdev, a site considered by both Hindus and Muslims as being of high spiritual significance.
SNT.79147.17589	The temple is the subject of an annual ten-day pilgrimage every September, which begins on September 13, although most of the 250,000 pilgrims who flock to the site arrive several days in advance of the festival.
SNT.79147.17590	The Chief Minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje visited the three villages in which the victims resided.
SNT.79147.17591	The local government has initiated a full inquiry into the disaster.

SNT.126425.17593	According to the witness reports the Al-Shabaab rebels took the town after two hours of fighting on Sunday.
SNT.126425.17594	After overtaking the city, the militants released prisoners from the city jail.
SNT.126425.17595	A resident told Reuters that seven people died in the fighting.
SNT.126425.17596	The United Nations Security Council has expressed "concern at the loss of life and the worsening humanitarian situation arising out of the renewed fighting".
SNT.126425.17597	Meanwhile, in Mogadishu, fighting between government forces and Al-Shabaab has left at least 68 people dead in the past two days.
SNT.126425.17598	The Somali government has started to lose ground against Al-Shabaab in the past few weeks.
SNT.126425.17599	Currently, it does not control much area outside of the capital which is reinforced by African Union troops.
SNT.33445.17600	The ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine were today sentenced to death by a Denpasar court.
SNT.33445.17601	Andrew Chan received the news via translators at about 3:45 p.m. AEDT, and Myuran Sukumaran was sentenced at about 4:50 p.m. AEDT.
SNT.33445.17602	The two were charged with attempting to smuggle 8.3 kg of heroin from Bali to Australia.
SNT.33445.17603	The Australian Federal Police have been criticised for allowing the Bali Nine to travel to Indonesia, where it was known they could face the death penalty.
SNT.33445.17604	Yesterday two other drug mules, Renae Lawrence and Scott Rush, were sentenced to life imprisonment.
SNT.33445.17605	Chan was alleged to be the mastermind of the operation, and Myuran was alleged to be an enforcer.
SNT.33445.17606	Chan, who claimed to have rediscovered his Christian faith, prayed for divine intervention prior to the sentence being handed down.
SNT.33445.17607	Chan fell over after jostling with a media scrum, and Sukumaran threw a bottle of water at the media.
SNT.33445.17608	Donald Rothwell, a Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney, has said that, unlike countries such as Singapore, it may not be long before the two are executed.
SNT.33445.17609	"The Indonesian judicial system is one in which death sentences are often carried out very quickly," he said.
SNT.33445.17610	"So unlike the situation of Van Nguyen in Singapore, where an appeal process and a clemency process played out over quite some time, this may not be the situation in Bali."
SNT.33445.17611	Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer told parliament today that he had made a direct request to the Indonesian government that the death penalty not be imposed.
SNT.33445.17612	"On the 18th of December last year, I wrote to the Indonesian Attorney-General reminding him that the Australian Government was opposed to the death sentence and we didn't want to see, in the context of the Bali nine, any of the Australians sentenced to death," he said.
SNT.33445.17613	In Bali the death sentence is carried out by firing squad.
SNT.119167.17614	An Israeli rocket has struck the Press TV building in the Gaza Strip.
SNT.119167.17615	According to the news agency, other television news stations called Al-Alam and Al Arabiya are also based inside the building.
SNT.119167.17616	There was no warning prior to the attack and only journalists were inside the building when the rocket hit.
SNT.119167.17617	Press TV states that some of their broadcasting equipment on the building's roof was damaged in the blast.
SNT.119167.17618	According to live video being broadcast by Press TV, journalists on the roof are marked with 'TV' or 'press' on their coats and helmets.
SNT.119167.17619	Press TV uses the roof of their building to broadcast most of their live video feeds of Gaza.
SNT.119167.17620	The agency claims that they were given assurance by the Israeli military that the building would not be targeted.
SNT.119167.17621	The agency also states that coordinates of the building were given to the Israeli military everyday so they would not attack the building or mistake news crews for Hamas militants.
SNT.119167.17622	Despite the claim by witnesses and Press TV employees, a spokesperson for the IDF states that the building was not a target and was likely a result of "collateral damage."
SNT.119167.17623	There are no reports of other buildings having been hit in the area around the Press TV building.
SNT.119167.17624	Press TV states that regardless of the attack, they are still "prepared to show the horrific attacks by the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) with graphic images of children being killed".
SNT.119167.17625	Press TV, an Iranian based news agency, is one of few international news agencies broadcasting live video feeds of Gaza and currently has more journalists in Gaza than any other world news agency.
SNT.12212.17626	Commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre will be held on July 11, when newly identified bodies will be buried.
SNT.12212.17627	In 1995, Serbian forces, according to International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), massacred around 7500 Bosnian Muslims.
SNT.12212.17628	It is expected that by July 11 another 550 bodies will be identified and ready for burial.
SNT.108775.17629	Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean president who has recently been widely criticized by world leaders, has claimed the current results show that he will have a 'sweeping victory' in the unopposed presidential run-off elections.
SNT.108775.17630	Mugabe announced his victory on one of the state run television networks.
SNT.108775.17631	"The returns show that we are winning convincingly, that we have won in all the 26 constituencies in Harare, an MDC stronghold where we won in only one constituency in March," he said.
SNT.108775.17632	Robert Mugabe was recently under a large amount of pressure to postpone the election after the main opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, pulled out due to fears of violence.
SNT.108775.17633	For example, Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations yesterday called for the election to be postponed.
SNT.108775.17634	He said that he "strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC (Southern African Development Community) that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed."

SNT.12491.17637	The National Movement for Simeon II which is currently ruling is in the second place, with around 21%.
SNT.12491.17638	The third is Ethnic Turks of Bulgaria, with around 11%.
SNT.12491.17639	It is expected that the National Movement for Simeon II will attempt to form a coalition with one of the lower placed parties in order to outnumber the Leftists.
SNT.12491.17640	At least 6,000 candidates (from 22 parties) ran for election to the 240 member parilament.
SNT.12491.17641	4% of the votes are needed to gain a seat.
SNT.12491.17642	The opposition Leftist Coalition, headed by Bulgarian Socialist Party lead the election, but did not gain an outright majority.
SNT.12491.17643	Sergei Stanishev, leader of the socialist party, stated he would attempt to form a governing coalition.
SNT.12491.17644	We are ready to form a government ... and we will negotiate with any democratic party," Stanisheve said in a press conference.
SNT.12491.17645	In the last six free elections held since 1989, no government has been re-elected -- each has had to implement stringent economic and social reforms, since the fall of communism, and has lost popular support as a result.
SNT.743.17646	The delegation representing Brazil at the funeral of Yasser Arafat returned today, November 13, 2004.
SNT.743.17647	The chief-minister of Civil House José Dirceu was a member of the delegation.
SNT.743.17648	Unfortunately they arrived too late for the funeral and the delegation watched only part of the funeral activities.
SNT.743.17649	PCdoB (Brazilian communist political party) Deputy Jamil Murad, member of the delegation, said there was a "deep mourning" feeling.
SNT.743.17650	Jamil Murad had visited Yasser Arafat in April 2004, along with nine other Brazilian deputies.
SNT.743.17651	According to Jamil Murad: "Yasser Arafat was a Palestinian leader who became a world projection leader".
SNT.119746.17652	Australia's Allan Davis won the 2009 Tour Down Under professional road cycling race.
SNT.119746.17653	Sprint specialist Davis completed Sunday's final stage in the main pack to maintain the lead he had built up in time bonuses from sprint wins earlier in the race.
SNT.119746.17654	122 cyclists completed the six day race around a circuit starting and ending at Adelaide, South Australia.
SNT.119746.17655	American cyclist Lance Armstrong also participated in the race, his first professional bike race since the 2005 Tour de France.
SNT.119746.17656	It is not clear if the seven-time Tour de France winner intended to compete for the general classification, but he did make an unsuccessful breakaway on Sunday in pursuit of a stage victory.
SNT.119746.17657	Despite several attacks over the week, Armstrong placed 29th in the general classification.
SNT.223612.17658	A spokesperson for Scotland Yard has confirmed that no arrests have been made after Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone was injured in a mugging on Wednesday.
SNT.223612.17659	The 80-year-old billionaire was treated in hospital for head injuries he sustained in the attack, in which the four muggers stole £200,000 of jewellery from him and his 31-year-old girlfriend.
SNT.223612.17660	The attack occurred as Ecclestone visited his company's office with girlfriend Fabiana Flosi—who was reportedly "shaken" but uninjured—in central London.
SNT.223612.17661	"There can be little doubt that this was a targeted robbery because of who Mr. Ecclestone is," a police source said.
SNT.223612.17662	"The muggers were callous and showed little regard for the victims.
SNT.223612.17663	Four years ago, Ecclestone was mugged as he parked his car outside his £10 million home in Chelsea Square; two wheels were taken from the car.
SNT.78653.17664	Freelance journalist Gabriel Pollard interviewed John Ballinger who has what is believed to be the first unlocked iPhone working in New Zealand on the Vodafone New Zealand GSM network.
SNT.78653.17665	Ballinger, director of Bluespark Ltd., managed to unlock the iPhone without having to solder anything.
SNT.78653.17666	This is unlike George Hotz, the first person to unlock the iPhone, who had to by using a different method involving soldering.
SNT.78653.17667	Ballinger followed the steps on how to unlock it on a website and had watched a few videos the day before.
SNT.78653.17668	He described the website, despite containing a few spelling mistakes, as "really good".
SNT.78653.17669	He says that the spelling mistakes are noticeable and can result in file-not-found errors.
SNT.78653.17670	It took Ballinger around four to five hours to complete all necessary steps.
SNT.78653.17671	However, half of this time was trying to get the case of the iPhone open.
SNT.78653.17672	He also didn't want to scratch the case, unlike others, so he used plastic tools "used to replace iPod batteries that worked okay."
SNT.78653.17673	He also recommends having two people on this job as this will help when it comes to shorting a circuit.
SNT.78653.17674	After that, all you have to do is run some software, according to Ballinger.
SNT.78653.17675	"The software part is pretty simple, follow the instructions and it could be made even easier if all the files were in one download.
SNT.78653.17676	However, he cannot use either the built-in YouTube application or the email applications as it will not connect to the Post Office Protocol.
SNT.78653.17677	"I can use all of them via the web browser but none by the inbuilt iPhone applications... but I am sure there will be an app you can install that will fix this or a new hack or it's just me."
SNT.78653.17678	He can also only get the Internet if there is a Wi-Fi connection, as Vodafone NZ has 3G but no EDGE; additionally, Ballinger could not get the slower GPRS working.
SNT.78653.17679-1	"If there was a 3G phone then this phone would be amazing!" 
SNT.78653.17679-2	He says he "really really" does love the iPhone due to its small size, its quietness, and the fact that it does not get hot.
SNT.114482.17680	At a Republican rally in Colorado, U.S. Alaskan governor and Vice-Presidential hopeful, Sarah Palin accused Democratic candidate Barack Obama of "palling around with terrorists who would target their own country".
SNT.114482.17681	The charge was repeated at a later rally for around 13,000 Orange County, California supporters.
SNT.114482.17682	The accusation centers around a report in The New York Times associating Obama with William C. Ayers, a Chicago professor who was a member of the radical Weathermen group during the 1960s.
SNT.114482.17683	Ayers was one of the founders of the Weathermen, and involved in their anti-Vietnam War bombing campaign throughout the early 1970s.
SNT.114482.17684	Loading her attack with hot-button issues, Palin told supporters "one of Barack's earliest supporters is a man who, according to the New York Times, and they are hardly ever wrong, was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that quote launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and US Capitol.
SNT.114482.17685	These are the same guys who think patriotism is paying higher taxes."
SNT.114482.17686	Despite Palin's attack, the original article in the October 3 New York Times concluded that Obama and Ayers were never close, and that the connection was through Obama's initial run for office and a schools reform project, "saying that their paths have crossed sporadically".
SNT.114482.17687	The report quotes Obama as describing Ayers as, "somebody who worked on education issues in Chicago that I know" and "somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8".
SNT.114482.17688	According to a campaign spokesman, the two men first met through the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, an educational project started in 1995.
SNT.114482.17689	Democratic campaign aides claim the alleged relationship has been played up by the presidential hopeful's opponents as a smear campaign.
SNT.114482.17690	Comparisons to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT) have been drawn.
SNT.114482.17691	SBVT was a political group drawn together during the 2004 presidential election with the aim of opposing John Kerry's candidacy.
SNT.78929.17692	Toy manufacturer Mattel announced today that they are recalling more products over fears of dangerous levels of lead in the toy's paint.
SNT.78929.17693	This soft, but heavy and poisonous metal can be fatal when there is more than 10 μg/dL in the blood.
SNT.78929.17694	The 800,000 toys have been recalled over safety fears and are thought to be mostly Barbie products.
SNT.78929.17695	This recall has increased the concern over the safety of the Chinese production process.
SNT.78929.17696	The lead paint was traced to an un-authorised producer and that firm was closed down, however the most recent source has not yet been located.
SNT.78929.17697	Chinese production accounts for almost 65% of Mattel's overall production.
SNT.78929.17698	Mattel is considered as one of the most stringent producers in the market however their reputation is in danger.
SNT.78929.17699	Toys that are currently being produced are being packaged ready for the Christmas rush, however there are fears that if these are recalled then there will be a Christmas shortage.
SNT.2765.17700	Various sources have indicated that as of today no significant international aid has arrived in the island of Nias -- a small volcanic island off the coast (North Sumatra province, Indonesia) -- a full ten days after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred.
SNT.2765.17701	These observations were noted by former Indonesian central parliament member Firman Jaya Daeli, activists from Howu-howu (a Dutch NGO), and Surf Aid International.
SNT.2765.17702	Most international aid in Indonesia has been focused on the province of Naggroe Aceh Darussalam (Aceh), as it is where the biggest number of dead has been reported.
SNT.2765.17703	There has also been other reports from local media that the island of Simeulue is suffering similar fate.
SNT.2765.17704	Although the number of dead in these two islands is relatively small compared to other areas, the number of people left homeless is far from insignificant.
SNT.2765.17705	In Simeulue of the 15 000 households 7 500 have permanently lost their homes.
SNT.2765.17706	The number of destroyed houses in Nias is estimated at 4 500.
SNT.2765.17707	Infrastructure damage, leading to slow distribution of food aid, has lead to the very real possibility of widespread starvation.
SNT.2765.17708	The island is popular with surfers who have mounted a considerable grassroots campaign to provide aid to the island (see links below).
SNT.2765.17709	Communication to and from the isolated island proves to be difficult.
SNT.116704.17710	Scotland has refused bail to the Libyan man convicted of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 despite his terminal cancer, as he can receive treatment in prison.
SNT.116704.17711	Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi was jailed in 2001 for the 1988 bombing of the transatlantic airliner, killing 270 people, but is seeking to have his conviction overturned.
SNT.116704.17712	Minutes after Edinburgh's Appeals Court rejected bail on compassionate grounds Jim Swire, spokesman for the victim's families who lost his daughter in the disaster, complained about the ruling.
SNT.116704.17713	"It has never been a goal of our group to seek revenge," said a lawyer outside the court reading from his statement.
SNT.116704.17714	"The refusal of a return to his family for a dying man whose verdict is not even yet secure looks uncomfortably like either an aspect of revenge -- or perhaps timidity."
SNT.116704.17715	Al-Megrahi, a former intelligence officer, is 54 and serving a minimum of 27 years for the bombing.
SNT.116704.17716	He has advanced prostate cancer which is spreading through his body.
SNT.116704.17717	His request for bail was rejected by Lord Hamilton, Scotland's head judge, who said that as doctors say he could live a few more years he should not be released unless and until after his appeal succeeds or his condition worsens.
SNT.116704.17718	Some other doctors give his time as just months, as the cancer has reached his bones.
SNT.116704.17719	Hamilton however said that palliative hormone treatment could prolong his life.
SNT.116704.17720	Hamilton also said Al-Megrahi was not suffering "material pain or disability".
SNT.116704.17721	The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ruled last year that the conviction may be a miscarriage of justice.
SNT.116704.17722	It said there was significant doubts to be raised over several key pieces of evidence in the original trial.
SNT.252189.17723	Figures released by the U.S. 2010 census on Wednesday show that the city of Detroit has lost approximately 238,270 people, one-fourth of its total, since 2000.
SNT.252189.17724	Detroit, once one of the top five U.S. cities in population, has its lowest number of residents since 1910.
SNT.252189.17725	Population numbers affect the the amount of federal and state funding a city receives.
SNT.252189.17726	In the last few decades, dozens of Michigan state laws have been passed allowing Detroit, because its population was at least 750,000, special measures to raise revenue and allocating it a larger share of Michigan's state revenue than its population warranted.
SNT.252189.17727	Now that Detroit's population has fallen to 713,777, it is no longer eligible for these financial advantages.
SNT.252189.17728	The mayor of Detroit, Dave Bing plans to appeal the census results.
SNT.252189.17729	"Every person that’s counted in the census brings approximately $10,000 to Detroit over the next decade for schools, roads, hospitals, and social service programs," Bing explained.
SNT.252189.17730	"Additionally, we could lose millions in statutory revenue sharing from the state.
SNT.252189.17731	We are in a fiscal crisis and we have to fight for every dollar.
SNT.252189.17732	The decline of the auto industry hastened the population loss already diminished by the 1967 riots that precipitated white flight to the suburbs.
SNT.252189.17733	Approximately 23 percent of the city’s living quarters are now empty.
SNT.252189.17734	To reduce the city's size there is a program in progress to demolish 10,000 abandoned or vacant buildings and turn the land into farms or countryside by 2014.
SNT.252189.17735	U.S. federal laws forbid drawing congressional district boundaries that dilute minority voting strength.
SNT.252189.17736	The 2000 redistricting rules for the 2012 elections mandated that Detroit's two congressional districts must be 60 percent black voters, since four out of five of Detroit's residents are black.
SNT.252189.17737	To comply, the two remaining congressional districts will have to expand into Detroit's mostly white suburbs to attain enough minority voters to meet the 60 percent target, reducing the clout of black Detroit.
SNT.252189.17738	Andrew Beveridge, Queens College sociology professor, attributed Detroit's population decline to the loss of its industrial base.
SNT.252189.17739	He said: "Except for New Orleans after Katrina, it's basically the largest drop for a U.S. city in history.
SNT.252189.17740	They have to find an economic base or the decline will continue."
SNT.29715.17741	13 American coal miners were trapped 2 miles (3 kilometers) inside the Sago coal mine in the US state of West Virginia.
SNT.29715.17742	They were trapped since 6:40 am Eastern, Monday, January 2 following a methane gas explosion which caused the shaft to collapse.
SNT.29715.17743	Rescue operations have commenced and at last report they were 1,400 feet from the location of the miners.
SNT.29715.17744	Governor Joe Manchin, who lost an uncle in a 1968 mining disaster is there along with families who held a vigil in the Sago Baptist Church.
SNT.50622.17745	A population study, released by Statistics New Zealand titled A History of Survival in New Zealand, highlights that the life expectancy of New Zealand males born in the mid 1890's would have been five years higher without the impact of the two world wars, as 10% of males died in war.
SNT.50622.17746	Also males born in the late 1910's would have had a three year higher life expectancy, without the impact of the two world wars as well.
SNT.50622.17747	The new study is an international study of survival and mortality.
SNT.50622.17748	The study also reveals that a male born in the late 1870's would have had an average life span of 51-years-old and in the 1930's the average life span was 69-years-old.
SNT.50622.17749	And in females the life expectancy is 75-years-old, previously 55-years-old.
SNT.50622.17750	Kim Dunstan, Statistics NZ demographer, said: "The dramatic lifespan changes were attributed to many factors, including improved hygiene, sanitation, medicines and infectious disease control.
SNT.50622.17751	People born in the late 1870's had a 23% chance of not making it to see their 15th birthday, people born in the 1900's had a 15% chance, people born in the 1930's had a seven percent chance, people born in the 1960's had a three percent chance and those born around the 1990's had a one percent chance.
SNT.50622.17752	Mr Dunstan said: "The study provided the most complete picture of how long New Zealanders lived and showed for the first time the impact of war deaths on the population.
SNT.50622.17753	Death comes to us all and it does affect us at a lot of levels.
SNT.50622.17754	A lot of people have had family members who died in the war and can relate to their own experiences."
SNT.50622.17755	A History of Survival in New Zealand also shows that New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that has an almost complete and detailed history of births, deaths and migration information dating back to the late 1800's.
SNT.50622.17756	This study is a historic book full of births, deaths and external migration for the population of New Zealand.
SNT.50622.17757	It will also be used in the future relating to health, population and mortality areas.
SNT.50622.17758	It is also unique because it follows the population from birth right through to death.
SNT.50622.17759	"We see the study very much as the basis for further work ... across other organisations in New Zealand and, indeed, internationally," Mr. Dunstan said.
SNT.145669.17760	The Philippine military said today that gunmen have seized at least 75 people, most of them schoolchildren, after a raid on a remote elementary school in the southern Philippines.
SNT.145669.17761	Military officials said that about fifteen gunmen from the Manobo tribe abducted some of the residents of a village on the Mindanao island on Thursday.
SNT.145669.17762	The group, reportedly armed with M-14 and M-16 rifles, captured four teachers and the school principal of the New Maasim Elementary School, and an unknown number of students.
SNT.145669.17763	The seizure occurred shortly after the flag ceremony, when they were due to start classes.
SNT.145669.17764	Two foresters for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources were also taken hostage.
SNT.145669.17765	Negotiations are being made to release the captives, according to a local police chief.
SNT.145669.17766	We are trying to find out how the others can be released," said Lino Calingasan to the Reuters news agency.
SNT.145669.17767	Local police have filed charges against the suspected kidnappers, however, they reported that the gunmen didn't seem to want to hurt or kill the hostages.
SNT.145669.17768	Officials said that the gunmen appear to be using them as human shields to escape.
SNT.145669.17769	The southern Philippines suffers from frequent banditry, loosely supervised government-armed militias, and Muslim and communist insurgents.
SNT.145669.17770	Last month, 57 people in an election convoy were massacred in the southern part of the Maguindanao province, which has since been placed under martial law.
SNT.86644.17771	On Tuesday, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing titled "Credit Card Practices: Unfair Interest Rate Increases."
SNT.86644.17772	The hearing examined the circumstances under which credit card issuers may increase the interest rates of cardholders who are in compliance with the terms of their credit cards.
SNT.86644.17773	Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin said in his opening statement: "Today's focus is on credit card issuers who hike the interest rates of cardholders who play by the rules — meaning those folks who pay on time, pay at least the minimum amount due, and wake up one day to find their interest rate has gone through the roof — again, not because they paid late or exceeded the credit limit, but because their credit card issuer decided they should be 'repriced'."
SNT.86644.17774	Present to testify on behalf of credit card issuers were Roger C. Hochschild of Discover Financial Services, Bruce L. Hammonds of Bank of America Corporation, and Ryan Schneider of Capital One Financial Corporation.
SNT.86644.17775	Much of the 90 minute hearing focused on specific cases where interest rates were raised, allegedly because credit scores of the debtor dropped, and not because they were delinquent or otherwise behind on payments.
SNT.86644.17776	According to Levin, this practice made it so that almost all payments went towards finance charges with almost none toward repaying the principal.
SNT.86644.17777	This, he felt, is an unfair practice, as the credit card companies were negligent in informing their customers of the rate hikes and the reason for such hikes.
SNT.86644.17778	The collective credit card debt of Americans totals an estimated US$900 billion.
SNT.86644.17779	Issuers have come under pressure to disclose their policies in regards to setting fees and interest rates.
SNT.86644.17780	The US Truth in Lending Act requires that terms of a loan be set forth up front.
SNT.86644.17781	Fluctuating interest rates on credit cards would, on the surface, appear to violate this act.
SNT.86644.17782	Roger C. Hochschild disagreed, arguing that "every card transaction is a new extension of credit ...
SNT.86644.17783	This makes it difficult — and risky — to underwrite, and price, the loan based solely on the borrower's credit-worthiness at the time of application [for the card]."
SNT.86644.17784	Ryan Schneider, agreed: "The ability to modify the terms of a credit card agreement to accommodate changes over time to the economy or the credit-worthiness of consumers must be preserved."
SNT.86644.17785	"Attempts to interfere with the market here ... will inevitably result in less credit being offered," warned Bruce Hammonds.
SNT.86644.17786	All three credit card executives also mentioned an ongoing Federal Reserve System review of credit card rules that already proposes a 45-day notification ahead of any rate changes.
SNT.86644.17787	Included in the criticism was the practice of mailing checks to card-holders, failing to notify applicants that obtaining additional cards could lower their credit score and raise their rates, and "ambushing" card-holders with raised rates.
SNT.86644.17788	Ranking minority member of the subcommittee, Norm Coleman said, "families find themselves ensnared in a seemingly inescapable web of credit card debt.
SNT.86644.17789	They particularly report being saddled with interest rates that skyrocketed on them seemingly out of the blue."
SNT.85130.17790	A fierce storm on Sunday resulted in massive 18-foot waves, which split a Russian oil tanker in two and sank two Russian freighters nearby.
SNT.85130.17791	The tanker spilled at least 560,000 gallons of fuel into a strait which leads to the Black Sea, and officials say it may take years to clean up.
SNT.85130.17792	The tankers sank in the Strait of Kerch, which links the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the northeast.
SNT.85130.17793	The two ships were carrying a total of around 7,150 tons of sulfur, according to Sergei Petrov, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations regional spokesperson.
SNT.85130.17794	The tanker was carrying nearly 1.3 million gallons of fuel oil, and was stranded several miles from shore.
SNT.85130.17795	Emergency workers were prevented from collecting the spilled oil immediately due to stormy weather; the head of the state environmental safety watchdog Rosprorodnadzor, Oleg Mitvol, said "there is serious concern that the spill will continue".
SNT.85130.17796	Workers eventually managed to begin work on cleaning up the spill, an effort which may be long-term.
SNT.85130.17797	Tar-like sands laden with oil and seaweed were piled on the shore, while oil-covered birds in slick-covered water tried to flap their wings.
SNT.85130.17798	Regional coast guard officer Anatoly Yanhuck said once weather improves they will begin pumping oil from the tanker, then tow the ship to port.
SNT.85130.17799	Two fuel-loaded barges and Turkish freighter Ziya Kos also ran aground in the area, but there was no further environmental damage, said Petrov.
SNT.85130.17800	Ten ships altogether were sunk or run aground in the area of the Black Sea near the Straight of Kerch and the Straight itself; a Russian freighter carrying metal was also reported as having sunk near the port of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.
SNT.85130.17801	One of the sulfur-carrying freighters reported three crew members as drowned, and five more as missing, while two members of the sunk freighter carrying metal were reported as drowned and another remains missing.
SNT.85130.17802	The oil tanker's 13 crew members were all rescued safely, and all members of the second freighter were also reported as safe.
SNT.85130.17803	Captains had been warned Saturday morning of the stormy conditions, regional prosecutor Maxim Stepanenko told Russia's Vesti 24.
SNT.85130.17804	The oil tanker was not built to withstand fierce storms, having been designed to transport oil on rivers during Soviet times, he said.
SNT.85130.17805	Chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Service office of response and restoration, Jim Farr said the sulfur spill from the two freighters wouldn't create a "hazardous situation", a statement backed up by Alexei Zhukovin, expert with the Emergency Situations Ministry's branch in Southern Russia.
SNT.85130.17806	Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass.
SNT.85130.17807	Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents.
SNT.85130.17808	Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution.
SNT.85130.17809	Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, and Ukraine all border on the Black Sea.
SNT.82860.17810	With resource reusing, environmental awareness, and creations, Jane Goodall Institute Taiwan held "2007 Hope Parade" in Taiwan and lots of environmental volunteers, community colleges, and charity organizations (approximately more than 10,000 people) participated this parade walking from Taipei Municipal Hsing-an Elementary School to Ketagalan Boulevard with some materials showing the presence of five continentals.
SNT.82860.17811	"To respond with theory of 'Roots & Shoots' by Dr. Jane Goodall, 'Roots & Shoots Program' in Taiwan has been promoted for a long time with the living quality improving and environment awareness valuing."
SNT.82860.17812	According to the organizer, this parade is originally founded with some communities in Xizhi, Taipei County.
SNT.82860.17813	To expand the global view of environment respect, this parade is chosen at Taipei City to show the particularity and differences of creatures which should be cared by common people.
SNT.52646.17814	In the second canonization ceremony of his papacy, Pope Benedict XVI today named four new saints.
SNT.52646.17815	The new saints were Rosa Venerini (1656-1728), Mother Theodore Guerin (1798-1856), Filippo Smaldone (1848-1923), and Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia (1878-1938).
SNT.52646.17816	Rosa Venerini helped to establish Italy's first public schools for girls.
SNT.52646.17817	Mother Theodore Guerin pioneered schools and religious institutions in Indiana after emigrating from France in 1840.
SNT.52646.17818	One of the schools she founded, a girls academy, is still in existence a few miles west of Terre Haute.
SNT.52646.17819	Now named Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, it is the oldest Catholic liberal arts college for women in the United States of America.
SNT.52646.17820	Italian priest Filippo Smaldone founded an order of nuns and schools for the deaf.
SNT.52646.17821	Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia disguised himself to care for the wounded during the anti-clerical Mexican revolution.
SNT.77264.17822	In the hills of Weiswampach, Luxembourg yesterday, the 12th International Wämper Triathlon became the setting for the national championship Olympic distance (1,5 km swimming, 40 km cycling, 10 km running) triathlon for both Belgium and Luxembourg.
SNT.77264.17823	The Belgian championship was scheduled to take place in Vilvoorde, Belgium, but because the concentration of Salmonella bacteria in the water was too high, the Belgians moved to Luxembourg.
SNT.77264.17824	On Saturday, an event for children and for the handicapped took place, along with the 10 kilometre running event.
SNT.77264.17825	On Sunday, the Juniors and the athletes for the Promotion race started the day, followed at 15:00 by the elite athletes.
SNT.77264.17826	Even though dark clouds hung over Weiswampach most of the afternoon, there was only a short rain shower during the cycling course.
SNT.77264.17827	In the men's race, Peter Croes (Belgium, Atriac team) and Dirk Bockel (Luxembourg, Celtic Diekirck team) started together for the final 10 kilometre run, but Bockel managed to outrun Croes by 23 seconds, prolonging his victory of last year.
SNT.77264.17828	Last year's winner, Stijn Goris from Belgium (LTTL team), came in third, followed closely by Bas Diederen from the Netherlands.
SNT.77264.17829	In the women's race, the top two athletes remained the same as last year; Elisabeth "Liz" May from Luxembourg managed to stay ahead of a pursuing group the entire race, and finished first ahead of Jessica Mayon.
SNT.77264.17830	Mayon secured the title of Belgian 1/4 Triathlon champion, in addition to the previously won Sprint Triathlon and Long Distance championships.
SNT.3162.17831	Mexican foreign minister Luis Ernesto Derbez says he is confident that he will become the next Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General, and will be in the post within 4 months.
SNT.3162.17832	He claims to have 17 of the 18 votes needed in order to have the support of a majority within the 34 member states of the OAS.
SNT.3162.17833	The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, served only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.
SNT.3162.17834	The other candidates for the post are ex El Salvadorean president Francisco Flores, Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchú and Chilean Interior Minister José Miguel Insulza.
SNT.3162.17835	Meanwhile Francisco Flores is in the Dominican Republic on the beginning of a tour of Caribbean countries drumming up support for his own candidacy.
SNT.3162.17836	He is being accompanied by El Salvador's deputy foreign minister Margarita Escobar in a clear sign of the importance El Salvador puts on getting their candidate into the job.
SNT.120377.17837	A trial date has been set in a fraud case against the Church of Scientology in France.
SNT.120377.17838	The date for the first hearing has been set for May 25, 2009.
SNT.120377.17839	If the Church is found guilty, then Scientology would be ruled illegal and would be banned from operating in France.
SNT.120377.17840	Prosecutors claim that the Church is engaged in illicit practices in attempts to sell their alleged self-help material.
SNT.120377.17841	The Church also faces charges of illegally operating as a pharmacy by illegally treating individuals with prescription medications.
SNT.120377.17842	The charges come from an unnamed woman, who in 1998 purchased nearly 140,000₣ (US$30,000) worth of Scientology self-help material which allegedly included prescription drugs.
SNT.120377.17843	After a few months passed, the woman said she felt like she was being scammed.
SNT.120377.17844	Following several complaints from other unnamed individuals and an investigation, judge Jean-Christophe Hullin ordered the Church's 'Celebrity Center', and the seven managers to be put on trial for fraud and "illegally practicing as pharmacists."
SNT.120377.17845	On September 8, 2008 the Church released a statement following the order to stand trial saying that they felt "stigmatized" by the French judicial system.
SNT.120377.17846	"The special treatment reserved for the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center raises questions about the equality of the justice system and the presumption of innocence," the Church said in a statement to the press.
SNT.120377.17847	This is not the first time the Church has been accused of fraud in France.
SNT.120377.17848	They have also been convicted of it several times, including the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard who was convicted of fraud in 1978.
SNT.120377.17849	In 1997 the Church was convicted of fraud in Lyon and 1999 in Marseille.
SNT.120377.17850	The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and his wife at the time, Mary Sue, both now deceased, and two other Scientologists.
SNT.120377.17851	The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and four Scientologists after a seven year investigation into the Church by the French authorities.
SNT.120377.17852	The court ruled that Hubbard and the others were using Scientology by making fraudulent claims that it was curing people from diseases to "increase the financial revenue" of the Church, and the ruling ordered Hubbard and the Scientologists to serve four years in prison.
SNT.120377.17853	However, Hubbard, along with the four Scientologists fled France, never to return, and never served a prison term.
SNT.57755.17854	An infectious superbug spreading in the United States is to "emerge in force" in Canada, doctors fear.
SNT.57755.17855-1	The bacteria have been reported popping up in day care centers and locker rooms across the U.S. 
SNT.57755.17855-2	Usually elderly or very ill hospital patients get the disease.
SNT.57755.17856	More than 2 million U.S. residents are infected every year, the Centers for Disease Control estimates.
SNT.57755.17857	An article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) on Tuesday said that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are "spreading with alarming rapidity."
SNT.57755.17858	The bacteria can cause boils, pimples, or in extreme cases, flesh-eating disease, and more.
SNT.57755.17859	"The resistant bacteria is an old foe with new fangs: a pathogen combining virulence, resistance and an ability to disseminate at large," wrote Dr. John Conly, medical professor and an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary.
SNT.57755.17860	British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario are the provinces which already have had MRSA in hospitals.
SNT.57755.17861	A 30-year-old Calgary, Alberta man died last year of lung abscesses associated with the infection, as well as a three-month old toddler in Toronto, Ontario.
SNT.57755.17862	Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Rios, last summer, suffered from an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus in his leg.
SNT.57755.17863	Pitcher Ty Taubenheim had a similar infection on his foot.
SNT.57755.17864	Doctors are currently investigating some Calgary residents, who could be one of the first Canadian reports of MRSA outside of a hospital setting.

SNT.41074.17866	The UN World Health Organization (WHO) says about 35,000 people have fallen ill, half the victims in the capital of Luanda, where the first cases were detected in February.
SNT.41074.17867	The UN say the epidemic is Angola’s worst cholera outbreak in almost two decades continues to rage on with 546 new cases and 31 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.

SNT.41074.17869	Spokesman for Medecines Sans Frontiere Richard Veerman said: "Angola is heading for its worst ever outbreak and the situation remains very bad in Angola," he said.
SNT.41074.17870	"It's very worrying, the official number of deaths countrywide is now more than 1,200, which is likely under-reported.
SNT.41074.17871	Many people will be at home and die at home and have no possibility to come to one of our treatment centres."
SNT.41074.17872	Cholera, an acute intestinal disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, causes copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment, including rehydration, is not given promptly.

SNT.51757.17874	The countries sending their foreign ministers are United Kingdom, the United States, China, France, Germany and Russia.
SNT.51757.17875	The participating nations, with the exception of Germany, have veto powers in the UN Security Council.
SNT.51757.17876	The UN Security Council is also likely to meet next week to discuss further action to take against Iran, following its failure to persuade Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment program.
SNT.51757.17877	Many western governments suspect that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capability.
SNT.51757.17878	Iran insists that the enriched uranium is meant for power generation only.
SNT.51757.17879	Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana have executed four rounds of negotiations on Iran's nuclear program but have failed to make a breakthrough.
SNT.51757.17880	Solana's representative, Cristina Gallach, stressed the current diplomatic efforts were different from a European initiative in 2004-05, which ultimately failed.
SNT.51757.17881	"The offer of November 2004 was only one and a half pages long and only had the Europeans' signature, while the June 2006 offer has the signature of the whole Security Council and Germany," she said.
SNT.30899.17882-1	A peaceful protest in Sarajevo, lasting for several weeks so far, was ignited by a post on an online discussion board, Sarajevo-X. 
SNT.30899.17882-2	 In a post named "Patriotism" one user, with nickname Stolac92, expressed his dissatisfaction with Bosnia today, writing among other things on December 22: "My heart hurts.
SNT.30899.17883	But what hurts the most is that we are quiet, we are tolerating, forgiving instead of doing something about it."
SNT.30899.17884	After receiving support from other forum members, the user proposed gathering in front of the Assembly building every day, starting from 5pm.
SNT.30899.17885	The protests started the same weekend, and had been lasting since, with couple to several dozen people attending.
SNT.30899.17886	Forum members decided they will not support any particular political party, but to work for Bosnia and Herzegovina without political ethnic entities and to support policies which are fair to all citizens and punish criminals.
SNT.30899.17887	They decided to use an open palm with a Bosnian map on it for their symbol, with word Dosta (Enough) as their slogan.
SNT.30899.17888	Bosnia and Herzegovina has been divided in two ethnic entities since the end of the war, the Serbian Republic and Federation of Bosniaks and Croats.
SNT.30899.17889	Economic progress has been slow and created disparity between people.
SNT.130014.17890	Since his death on Friday, tributes have continued to be paid to Sir Bobby Robson, the former manager of the English national association football team.
SNT.130014.17891	Silences were held at football games throughout the country over the weekend, with fans creating makeshift shrines at Newcastle United and Ipswich Town, the two clubs he was most strongly associated with.
SNT.130014.17892	Today Robson's widow was moved to tears when she visited the shrine created by over 50,000 fans at Newcastle.
SNT.130014.17893	She went on to express her gratitude to the generosity and affection of fans who have since Friday raised over £2,000,000 for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, the cancer charity founded by her late husband.
SNT.130014.17894	At Ipswich fans hope to rename one of the stands at Portman Road after their former manager.
SNT.130014.17895	Despite failing to win any major trophies with the national team, Bobby Robson was one of the most successful and best loved England managers.
SNT.130014.17897	His team infamously lost a penalty shoot out to West Germany for a place in the finals of the 1990 World Cup.
SNT.130014.17898	Robson was picked for the position of England manager after a 13 year spell at Ipswich Town enabling them to become league runners up twice and to win the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.
SNT.130014.17899	Following the decision by the Football Association to not renew his contract after the 1990 World Cup, Robson won honours in club football with PSV Eindhoven, FC Porto, and FC Barcelona.
SNT.130014.17900	His success as a manager has been put down to a great tactical brain and the ability to get the best out of his players, not least through his respect and generosity of spirit towards them.
SNT.130014.17901	Robson will be remembered for his humour, his integrity, and his love of a game that he relished from childhood visits to his beloved Newcastle, a team he was later to manage.
SNT.130014.17902	He died at the age of 76 after a long battle with cancer, and leaves behind his wife of 54 years Elsie and their sons Andrew, Paul, and Mark.
SNT.109786.17903	A bomb explosion on a bus in Myanmar (alternatively Burma) has killed a 55-year-old man and left another man wounded.
SNT.109786.17904	The explosion occurred yesterday at 8:50 am local time (0220 GMT) as the bus traveled to Yangon, but state media has only posted news of the attack today.
SNT.109786.17905	The deceased was identified only as Khant by the New Light of Myanmar, the Burmese government-owned daily newspaper.
SNT.109786.17906	The article said that the injured man was 46-year-old Pa Pa and that he received a stomach injury.
SNT.109786.17907	The bus had 35 passengers traveling from Kyaukkyi, and was near Daik Oo, some 85 miles from its destination.
SNT.109786.17908	The bombing was blamed on insurgents, but it is unclear which group is responsible.
SNT.109786.17909	The ruling military junta is subject to attacks from a number of extremist groups opposed to its rule.
SNT.109212.17910	A British High Court judge has ruled that Pringles are not a potato snack and therefore not subject to a 17.5% tax.
SNT.109212.17911	The judge, Justice Nicholas Warren, overruled a Value Added Tax (VAT) Tribunal decision that imposed the 17.5% tax which is also applied on other potato products.
SNT.109212.17912	Pringles' owner Procter & Gamble had claimed at a ruling in May that Pringles do not feel, look, or taste like a crisp.
SNT.109212.17913	Justice Warren ruled that since Pringles are only 42% potato, it is exempt from VAT.
SNT.186794.17914	Ukrainian basketball player Alexander Belostenny has died at the age of 51.

SNT.186794.17916	He won gold in the 1979, 1981 and 1985 European championships and gold in the 1982 FIBA World Championship.
SNT.186794.17917	After retiring in 1994 he ran his own restaurant up in Germany, which he had acquired in 1991.
SNT.186794.17918	Following the announcement of his death, the Ukrainian basketball federation released a statement saying that "On behalf of all fans, we want to express our deep condolences to the families and friends of the deceased.
SNT.186794.17919	The bright memory of Alexander M. Belostenny will always live in our hearts."
SNT.218885.17920	Joe Gibbs Racing driver Denny Hamlin, who qualified thirtieth, won the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 2010 AAA Texas 500 held on Sunday at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas, United States.
SNT.218885.17921	This became his eighth win of the season, and his second at Texas Motor Speedway.
SNT.218885.17922	Throughout the course of the race there were nine cautions and thirty-five lead changes among fourteen different drivers.

SNT.218885.17926	Greg Biffle, from the Roush Fenway Racing team, clinched the fifth position, after leading 223 laps during the race.
SNT.218885.17927	Kevin Harvick followed Biffle in sixth, while Clint Bowyer could only manage seventh.
SNT.218885.17928	Hamlin became the Drivers' championship leader with 6,325 points, thirty-three points ahead of Johnson.
SNT.218885.17929	The Manufacturers' сhampionship standings is led by Chevrolet with 249, 40 points ahead of Toyota and 91 ahead of Ford with two races remaining in the season.
SNT.218885.17930	Looking forward to next week, Hamlin said, "I'm going to race Phoenix as if I'm 33 behind, to be honest with you.
SNT.218885.17931	There's no comfortable margin going into Homestead, because anything can happen.
SNT.218885.17932	So for me — Phoenix being an up-and-down race track for me — I've got to really be focused on practice day to get what I need, to give [crew chief] Mike [Ford] the information that I need — just 100 percent stay focused is all I can do.
SNT.218885.17933	But like I say, I'm not going to be conservative having the lead.
SNT.218885.17934	I'm going to want to stretch that out before we get to Homestead.
SNT.42831.17935	England beat Paraguay 1-0 in a bruising encounter among the shadows of the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt, Saturday.
SNT.42831.17936	In the sunshine and heat, which reached 30 degrees Celsius, it became a physical game that saw three bookings and the referee frequently blowing his whistle.
SNT.42831.17937	England got the perfect start scoring after just 3 minutes from a David Beckham freekick.
SNT.42831.17938	Swung in from the left of the field, the ball clipped the head of Paraguayan captain Carlos Gamarra on its way to the net.
SNT.42831.17939	Both sides looked nervous and no side got control of the midfield.
SNT.42831.17940	Passes were frequently misplaced and attacks from both teams lacked cutting edge.
SNT.42831.17941	Paraguay lost number one goalkeeper Justo Villa to an injury in the sixth minute of the game.
SNT.42831.17942	Missing Wayne Rooney, arguably their team's most skilled player, whose recent injury though healed had ruled him out for this match, the noisy England fans in the crowd didn't have much to sing about except the victory.
SNT.42831.17943	England's Swedish manager Sven-Göran Eriksson's side had more possession but failed to score more than the one early goal.
SNT.42831.17944	On their part, Paraguay was unable to capitalise on a number of English defensive errors to get an equaliser.
SNT.42831.17945	England next face Trinidad and Tobago while Paraguay face the England manager's home nation, Sweden.
SNT.50988.17946	A Virgin Trains train travelling at high speed collided with a car near Copmanthorpe, Yorkshire, England, killing the car's driver.
SNT.50988.17947	The accident took place at approximately 20:55 GMT when the Class 220/221 train, travelling at close to 100mph, hit the car which was on the tracks.
SNT.50988.17948	The train then partially derailed but remained upright, coming to a stop further down the tracks.

SNT.50988.17950	North Yorkshire Police said that the car had left the road, driven through a fence and ended up on the track.
SNT.50988.17951	The train was the 14:25 Virgin Voyager cross-country service from Plymouth to Edinburgh Waverley, capable of speeds up to 125mph, but was deccelerating on approach into York.
SNT.50988.17952	The line between York and Leeds was closed for several hours, delaying other services.
SNT.50988.17953	Virgin Spokesman Arthur Leathley told reporters that Network Rail hoped to have three of the four lines in that section of the track operational by Tuesday morning.

SNT.145278.17955	The blast targeted a university graduation ceremony being attended by a number of government officials.
SNT.145278.17956	The Shamo Hotel was hosting a graduation ceremony for Benadir University.
SNT.145278.17957	Eyewitnesses reported that a suicide bomber gained access to the venue dressed as a woman, donning a full abaya and a veil.
SNT.145278.17958	The attacker was wearing an explosive strapped to his torso, but was not patted down by security.
SNT.145278.17959	The director of Median Hospital, Ali Yusuf, commented that "forty people with shrapnel wounds, including students and medical doctors, have been hospitalized today.
SNT.145278.17960	Former Islamic Courts Union members at the scene identified the bomber, whose head and face had been completely shaven, as a member of al-Shabab, the ultra-conservative Islamist group believed to have links to al-Qaeda.
SNT.145278.17961	Somali Health Minister Qamar Aden Ali, Education Minister Ahmed Abdullahi Waayeel, and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were killed in the attack on Hotel.
SNT.145278.17962	Abdulkadir Mohamed Osman, the Somali presidency's director of information, commented on the incident.
SNT.145278.17963	The blast rocked inside the hotel, killing three ministers and wounding another one."
SNT.145278.17964	Adow served as the foreign secretary of the insurgent Islamic Courts Union when it took power in 2006.
SNT.145278.17965	The Somali minister for sports is also reported to be hospitalized and in critical condition.
SNT.145278.17966	Mohamed Mohamoud, an attending graduate of the ceremony, said that he personally saw the remains of the health minister on the ground, as well as the corpses of other government officials.

SNT.145278.17968	Two journalists, a reporter for Radio Shabelle and a cameraman with al-Arabia TV, were also found dead from the explosion.
SNT.145278.17969	The National Union of Somali Journalists has issued a statement condemning the attack and expressing outrage at the loss of their colleagues.
SNT.145278.17970	Somalia is one of the world's most dangerous places for journalists to work.
SNT.145278.17971	Eight have been killed in Somalia since the beginning of 2009.
SNT.145278.17972	Hotel Shamo is often chosen by government officials to host events and at one time was a popular lodging option for foreign journalists.
SNT.145278.17973	Recently-released Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout and Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan were staying at the hotel before their capture last year.
SNT.145278.17974	The hotel security staff say that they were kicked out of the room prior to the ceremony, as government security officials wanted sole handling of the event.
SNT.145278.17975	The government officials were attending the graduation of 43 students from the local Banadir University.
SNT.145278.17976	The official death toll from the blast is expected to continue to rise, with some reports indicating that more than 60 people have been found dead.
SNT.145278.17977	The attack is the latest in a string of incidents linking al-Shabab to common insurgent tactics used by Islamist terrorist groups in other parts of the world.
SNT.145278.17978	Until recently, suicide bombings were an unusual practice in Somalia.
SNT.145278.17979	In September, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for a bold attack on a meeting between government officials and the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, which killed 17 peacekeepers, including the top Burundian commander.
SNT.145278.17980	Two vehicles containing explosives were given entry to the AMISOM base and subsequently blew up.
SNT.145278.17981	The rebel group is battling for control of the war-ravaged nation against the Western-backed Transitional Federal Government, led by former Islamic insurgent Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed.
SNT.145278.17982	Rebel groups control much of southern and central Somalia, as well as significant portions of Mogadishu.
SNT.145278.17983	The government is being bolstered by the continuing presence of the peacekeeping force composed of Ugandans and Burundians.
SNT.145278.17984	The AMISOM forces are mandated with the protection of key city sites such as the airport, seaport, and presidential palace.
SNT.8368.17985	Sir Richard Branson, successful British entrepreneur, better known as the founder of the Virgin brand, has made a suggestion to the next British chancellor to both save MG Rover, the largest independent manufacturer of cars in England until it collapsed this spring, and help with rapidly rising oil demand.
SNT.8368.17986	He wants the British government to give subsidies to the fallen car-maker so that it can be the first European producer of hybrid cars.
SNT.30507.17987	A 7-year old Tennessee boy who was eager to get his driver's license got an early education when he decided to take his parents pick-up truck for a joyride.
SNT.30507.17988	The boy, whose name was not released, remembered to wear his seatbelt and even used his turn signal when he was supposed to.
SNT.30507.17989	Police chasing the boy initially thought they were chasing a drunk driver.
SNT.30507.17990	He couldn't stay in his lane," Officer Josh Laverette said.
SNT.30507.17991	But when the truck came to a stop in front of a house, police saw that it was a boy, a second grader, barely 4 feet tall, behind the wheel.
SNT.30507.17992	"He was so short he had to sit up close to the steering wheel," Laverette said.
SNT.30507.17993	"Whenever he would brake, he would pick himself up with his left foot and stomp on the brake with his right."
SNT.30507.17994	When police began to talk to the boy, who managed to park in front of his own home, "He said the reason he took the vehicle was because he wanted to get his license," said Laverette.
SNT.30507.17995	"There were like probably five city cars and three county cars and a state trooper" all of which were chasing the pickup, said Susan Daniel, a witness to the incident.
SNT.30507.17996	"It blew my mind because we actually watched him put on his turn signal and turn, and we could see when he went past that he had seat belts on," Daniel said.
SNT.30507.17997	"Then to come find out it was a child, I was really shocked."
SNT.30507.17998	The boy was charged with driving without a license, eluding police and leaving the scene of an accident.
SNT.30507.17999	He is expected to appear in juvenile court next week.
SNT.5645.18000	The Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera are reporting that US forces may not have been informed of the operation to rescue kidnapped Italian journalist, Giuliana Sgrena, in which the intelligence agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US troops.
SNT.5645.18001	The Italian government disputes this account, and has said that the US was fully aware of the operation on March 4.
SNT.5645.18002	La Repubblica is reporting that US forces were aware of Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari's presence, but not the specific details of his mission.
SNT.5645.18003	Speaking in the La Repubblica newspaper, General Mario Marioli assisted those involved in the operation in Baghdad, by obtaining a special badge for them from coalition forces upon their arrival.
SNT.5645.18004	However, as the deputy commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, Marioli reported that he was unaware of Calipari's purpose in Iraq, so he could not tell coalition troops on the ground the details of the Italian mission.
SNT.5645.18005	According to La Repubblica, Marioli reported that he "had no contact with US intelligence officers" prior to the shooting.
SNT.1237.18006	The People's Republic of China has signed an agreement with ASEAN to establish the world's largest free trade area.
SNT.1237.18007	Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, India and Australia are considering joining.
SNT.1237.18008	ASEAN members include Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore and Indonesia.
SNT.1237.18009	In the last four years China has become a major importer of oil and commodities, and a major exporter of finished goods.
SNT.1237.18010	China has also strengthened relationships with oil suppliers in the Middle East and Africa.
SNT.1237.18011	This pact lifts trade restrictions and removes tariffs from many imports and exports.
SNT.1237.18012	It also allows China to continue manipulating the value of its currency in its own interests.
SNT.1237.18013	The yuan is currently undervalued, making Chinese-made goods artificially cheap for foreign importers.
SNT.1237.18014	Stated in the agreement is ASEAN's intention to create a unified economy--and by implication polity--similar to the EU.
SNT.1237.18015	This agreement will cement China's role as the center of the South Asian regional economy, and at the same time strengthening bonds between China and other countries in the region and ease their suspicions over a growing superpower.
SNT.1237.18016	Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun separately adopted accords with the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, agreeing to launch the talks early next year.
SNT.1237.18017	Australia and New Zealand are expected to sign similar agreements with ASEAN before discussions close later Tuesday, although ASEAN remains wary of Australian Prime Minister John Howard's refusal to sign its nonaggression treaty.
SNT.1237.18018	Howard played down these concerns but said on record that he reserves the right to preemptively act against terrorists on foreign soil if they threaten Australia.
SNT.141407.18019	Pakistani officials have said that five attacks on government sites across the country have killed at least forty people.
SNT.141407.18020	The latest attack occurred late on Thursday at a government residential area in Peshawar.
SNT.141407.18021	Officials said they suspect Taliban militants for being responsible for the attacks.

SNT.9602.18127	At the same time, the 1 skips other stops, which are only served by the 9 at rush hours; some stops are served by all trains.
SNT.9602.18128	This service pattern results in slightly faster trains, but longer waits for those going to or from skipped stations.
SNT.9602.18129	9 service was started on December 12, 1988, at first running during rush hours and middays.

SNT.28095.18140	Federal Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock will issue a certificate to prevent information judged to be sensitive from reaching the public at Lodhi's trial.
SNT.28095.18141	The Federal Attorney-General has the powers to do this under the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act.

SNT.28095.18143	Tom Blackburn, SC, counsel for the media groups mounting the challenge claims that the act allows for the federal executive to intrude into judicial matters by ordering parts of the trial are kept secret.
SNT.28095.18144	The challenge will be heard on 31st January 2006 by Justice Anthony Whealy of the Supreme Court of NSW.
SNT.28095.18145	In the course of Lodhi's trial, towards the end of December Justice Anthony Whealy ruled that evidence and pre-trial matters are to remain secret.
SNT.123268.18146	A federal judge ruled Monday that the controversial morning-after pill Plan B must be made available without a prescription to girls as young as 17, citing the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) willingness to concede to the Bush administration's conservative influences by setting the age limit to 18 in 2006.
SNT.123268.18147	Plan B, available in the United States since 1999, consists of two pills designed to prevent conception and must be taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse.
SNT.123268.18148	Only since 2006 has it been available without a prescription, following lobbying from the World Health Organization and American Medical Association.
SNT.123268.18149	Currently the drug is only available without a prescription to women over the age of 18.
SNT.123268.18150	The lawsuit was filed in 2005 by the Center for Reproductive Rights.
SNT.123268.18151	In the ruling, the judge blasted the FDA for giving in to "political considerations" and delaying approval of the new age limit.
SNT.123268.18152	Susan F. Wood, former director of women's health at the FDA, resigned in 2005 in protest over the agency's handling of the drug.
SNT.123268.18153	“What happened with Plan B demonstrated that the agency was off track, and was not being allowed to do its job properly,” she said.
SNT.123268.18154	The Family Research Council, a conservative organization, said the judge had given in to "political ideology promoting sexual license for teens."

SNT.132170.18162	Chief Inspector Sam Cordner said: "The actions of terrorist criminals in planting this device in the Forkhill area put local people and police officers at significant risk."
SNT.132170.18163	"Their target may have been the police, but they did not care who they killed or injured."
SNT.132170.18164	"It is only through the hard work and professionalism of police officers and their military colleagues that the area has been made safe," Cordner said.

SNT.105210.18180	He was an adviser to the president at the time of his death.
SNT.105210.18181	Bodies were flown into Juba Airport were relatives waited for hours for news.
SNT.105210.18182	UNMIS is expected to fly the bodies on to their nearby airfield, to which there is no public access.
SNT.105210.18183	The disaster is thought to be an accident caused by mechanical trouble.
SNT.105210.18184	The pilot had contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) to report engine problems and requested permission to conduct an emergency landing at nearby Rumbek.
SNT.117944.18185	In proceedings by the Guantanamo military commission at the United States Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on Monday, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four alleged co-conspirators stated that they will confess and plead guilty to the charges they face in the planning and execution of the September 11 attacks in 2001.

SNT.117944.18188	Mohammed also expressed displeasure that it took over a month for the court to address his filing requesting "an immediate hearing session to announce our confessions."
SNT.117944.18189	In court he said, "I don't know — are the military commissions using carrier pigeons or what?" speaking in English.
SNT.117944.18190	The judge would not accept pleas from Binalshibh and al-Hawsawi, ordering mental competency hearings for the two.

SNT.117944.18192	However, Mohammed told the judge they would not enter their pleas without Binalshibh and al-Hawsawi, "We want everyone to plead together."
SNT.117944.18193	After the competency evaluations, another hearing will be held, where the five may enter their pleas.
SNT.117944.18194	Presiding Officer Stephen Henley asked for briefs from prosecutors on whether the military commission can "accept a plea of guilty to a capital offense."

SNT.5004.18197	The 16 year old private-public project aims to add Poliomyelitis to the list of childhood diseases which have been eliminated.
SNT.5004.18198	The World Health Organization, Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF are leading the Initiative and coordinating a series of overlapping immunization campaigns in the region.
SNT.5004.18199	In 2004 Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan cut their number of Polio cases by 45%.
SNT.5004.18200	In 2005 the goal is to cut the number of cases by 100%.
SNT.5004.18201	The three countries are the last in Asia to have endemic polio, and the disease is confined to a small number of regions within the country.
SNT.5004.18202	Only 186 cases were reported in 2004, down from 336 the previous year.
SNT.121075.18203	The United States military Strategic Command (STRATCOM) has said that the 'fireballs' spotted over areas of Texas in the United States on Sunday February 15, are not related to the collision of a U.S. and Russian satellite in space.
SNT.121075.18204	According to spaceweather.com, NASA says the object was a meteor.
SNT.121075.18205	"There is no correlation between the debris from that collision and those reports of re-entry," said STRATCOM military spokeswoman Major Maj. Regina.
SNT.121075.18206	"It's a natural meteor, definitely," said Bill Cooke, an astronomer at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.
SNT.121075.18207	On Tuesday, February 10, the American civilian communications satellite Iridium 33, launched in 1997, and the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos-2251, launched in 1993, collided over Siberia.
SNT.121075.18208	On Friday February 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an alert for falling debris from the satellites, following reports of "explosions and earthquakes" along with "flashes in the sky" in Jackson and Louisville, Kentucky.
SNT.121075.18209	Then again on Sunday, calls to 9-1-1 began to come in to Williamson County, Texas sheriff's office around 12:30 p.m. (Central time) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of Austin, Houston, Waco and San Antonio.
SNT.121075.18210	"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris."
SNT.121075.18211	"These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky," said the NOAA on Friday in an public information alert posted on their website.
SNT.121075.18212	The FAA says the burning material over Texas is not related to this alert.
SNT.121075.18213	Residents in Texas reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions on Sunday morning.
SNT.121075.18214	After a search of several areas, the Williamson county sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found.
SNT.121075.18215	Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding.
SNT.121075.18216	There was previous speculation was that the object in Texas could have been a meteor.
SNT.121075.18217	Doctor Marco Ciocca, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University told WKYT on Sunday that it's too early for the debris from the satellites to be reentering the planet's atmosphere.
SNT.121075.18218	"[It could] be months" before any of the satellite wreckage enters the earth's atmosphere.
SNT.121075.18219	"It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into earth's atmosphere."
SNT.121075.18220	However, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) said on February 12 that the debris could have taken 10 days or less to reenter over portions of the planet.
SNT.121075.18221	"Within 24 hours of the collision, the U.S. space tracking system had identified 600 pieces of debris."
SNT.121075.18222	"This large number suggests that the collision must have been relatively head-on."
SNT.121075.18223	"If the two satellites hit head-on, rather than a glancing blow, the energy of the collision would completely disintegrate both satellites into clouds of debris," said the UCS in a statement on their website who also added that the collision took place in "the same region of space where China destroyed a defunct Chinese weather satellite with an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon" in 2007.
SNT.121075.18224	"That January 2007 test created a massive amount of debris."
SNT.121075.18225	There have been at least eight major satellite collisions since 1991.
SNT.121075.18226	The satellites, both of which had a mass in excess of 450 kilograms, and were traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour (28,150 km/hour), collided 491 miles (790 km) above the earth.
SNT.121075.18227	Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive.
SNT.121075.18228	They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the earth will be affected.
SNT.121075.18229	The results of a plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.
SNT.208936.18230	New research published in the journal Nature Medicine has shown a link between a faulty gene and migraines.
SNT.208936.18231	Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to improved pain management treatments for sufferers, with possible benefits for pain treatment generally.
SNT.208936.18232	The breakthrough involves a gene known as TRESK, thought to control the brain's reaction to pain: if it is defective, then many normal activities and actions will be painful.
SNT.208936.18233	Migraine sufferers (thought in the United Kingdom to number about eight per cent of men and eighteen per cent of women) often complain that light, noise and touch cause pain.
SNT.208936.18234	TRESK can potentially be affected by drugs that would change the point at which it reports pain, which would alleviate the suffering of those with migraines.
SNT.208936.18235	The study involved scientists from the Medical Research Council Functional Genomics Unit at the University of Oxford and from Canada.
SNT.208936.18236	They looked at the DNA of 110 people with migraine and members of their family, and found that TRESK was a major component in migraines.
SNT.208936.18237	One of the Oxford researchers, consultant neurologist Zameel Cader, described it as a "once in a generation find" and said that it could "potentially lead to a treatment for pain in general."
SNT.208936.18238	Before this study, no genes had been directly linked to migraines, although parts of the DNA that raised the general risk had been found.
SNT.208936.18239	Migraines are described by the World Health Organisation as a major worldwide cause of disability.
SNT.208936.18240	In Britain, it is estimated that migraines affect 20 per cent of the population, with about 190,000 migraines occurring daily and over 25 million lost days from work every year.
SNT.208936.18241	Lee Tomkin, director of a sufferers' charity, Migraine Action, described the news as "fantastic" and "genuinely a really great step forward."
SNT.208936.18242	Professor Peter Goadsby from the Migraine Trust termed it "a novel direction to consider new therapies in this very disabling condition."
SNT.5916.18243	With studies suggesting the existence of life on Mars, the new system may soon see implementation.
SNT.43531.18244	Paraguay beat Trinidad and Tobago in a match that had no effect on the qualifiers through to the round sixteen of the Fifa World Cup, Tuesday.
SNT.43531.18245	Paraguay edged the game from start to finish and got a goal in each half.
SNT.43531.18246	Trinidad and Tobago could manage just two shots to trouble Aldo Bobadilla in the Paraguay net.
SNT.43531.18247	Kelvin Jack, who started his first Fifa World Cup game, made seven saves.
SNT.43531.18248	After 25 minutes Jack was a bystander when Roberto Acuna's freekick was driven hard into the box.
SNT.43531.18249	Jack's central defender Brent Sancho inadvertently directed the ball goalbound with his head.
SNT.43531.18250	The goal that sealed the game for the South Amercians was scored six minutes from time by Nelson Cuevas after he had exchanged passes with Roque Santa Cruz.
SNT.43531.18251	The game was notable for being the last appearance for Carlos Gamarra, 35, for his national side.
SNT.43531.18252	After three games the Group B table was topped by England with seven points and then Sweden with five points with Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago going out of the competition.
SNT.34871.18253	The Common Council requested on Tuesday that a picture be found on what many thought was the site of a previous hotel.
SNT.34871.18254	The Proposed Elmwood Village Hotel would be placed on the intersection of Elmwood and Forest.
SNT.34871.18255	It was suspected by residents and business owners in the area that hotel once stood in the same spot.
SNT.34871.18256	The Elmwood Village hotel is a proposed development by Savarino Construction Services Corp.
SNT.34871.18257	After some research, a freelance journalist writing for Wikinews was able to determine that there was never a hotel on the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel site.
SNT.34871.18258	However; there was a temporary hotel located on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest.
SNT.34871.18259	Buffalo was the host of the Pan-American Exposition from May 1 until November 2, 1901.
SNT.34871.18260	It was a fair designed to feature the latest in technology, including electricity.
SNT.34871.18261	There was a midway, athletic events, and had African, Eskimo, and Mexican villages.
SNT.34871.18262	However; what is likely the most famous event that took place at the exposition was the assassination of then President William McKinley on September 6, 1901.
SNT.34871.18263	He was shot by Leon Czolgosz just outside the Temple of Music and died eight days later while in the home of John Milburn on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo.
SNT.34871.18264	Just a short time later, Theodore Roosevelt was inaugurated on September 14, 1901 at the Wilcox House on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo.
SNT.34871.18265	During that time several hotels and rooming houses were built around the exposition including The Elmwood at 717 Elmwood, the Hotel Elmhurst at Forest and Lincoln Parkway, Hotel Gibbs 1005-1021 Elmwood, the R. Palmerton Merritt at 441 Forest and The Norman at 422 Forest.
SNT.34871.18266	Probably the most famous hotel that was built during the exposition was the Statler's Pan-American Hotel built by Ellsworth Milton Statler.
SNT.34871.18266-1	A freelance journalist writing for Wikinews has obtained the only known reproduction photo of the hotel [pictured at the top].
SNT.34871.18267	The hotel stood on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, had 2,100 sleeping rooms and accommodations for 5,000.
SNT.34871.18268	At the time, the Statler was the largest hotel [based on the number of rooms] ever constructed.
SNT.34871.18269	It was three stories high, plastered on the inside, made mostly of wood and was covered with ornamental staff on the outside, which made it semi-fireproof.
SNT.34871.18270	Every room was an outside room and was well lighted and ventilated.
SNT.34871.18271	It was located within one block of the exposition's main entrance.
SNT.34871.18272	The Statler was built for only one thing, the exposition.
SNT.34871.18273	Work began in 1900 and finished just before the beginning of the exposition.
SNT.34871.18274	When the exposition ended in November, the hotel was taken down.
SNT.34871.18275	Maps from 1894 show that there was no hotel, let alone any buildings or houses on the intersection.
SNT.34871.18276	However; research did show that the homes 1119-1121 Elmwood, the buildings that would be demolished to build the Elmwood Village Hotel, were built sometime before 1915 but were not on the intersection prior to 1902.
SNT.34871.18277	Based on research conducted at the Buffalo Historical Society, it was concluded that between the years of 1890 and 1902, no other major hotel existed in the area.
SNT.34871.18278	In fact, research had shown that almost every hotel built in the area, existed only during the time of the exposition.
SNT.34871.18279	Research also indicated a hotel or a rooming house at 1089 Elmwood around 1901-1903.
SNT.34871.18280	The only known name of the hotel was the John C. Hill Hotel.
SNT.34871.18281	The hotel was in the house now called the Atwater House.
SNT.34871.18282	The house was the first house to be built on the east side of the block.
SNT.34871.18283	The Atwater House is currently vacant and owner Pano Georgiadis wants to demolish it to expand his restaurant.
SNT.34871.18284	The house was built by 1894 and the original owner and builder of the house is currently unknown.
SNT.34871.18285	Its earliest known occupant was Edward Atwater who in 1862 founded the oil refinery company of Atwater & Hawes in Buffalo.
SNT.34871.18286	The site of this company was recently uncovered in the Canal District during an archeological dig.
SNT.34871.18287	At the moment, current research does not show any connection between the two men.
SNT.500589.18288	Numerous cities throughout Texas, United States have begun broadening their efforts to fight mosquito populations, in an effort to reduce transmission of the sometimes-lethal West Nile virus.
SNT.500589.18289	Officials in Dallas county have declared a public health emergency.
SNT.500589.18290	Officials there have requested use of five planes, intended to spray most of North Dallas, as well as other sections of the city.
SNT.500589.18291	Tim Whitley, a city official in Malakoff, told Wikinews his city has begun using a pesticide specialist to spray two times weekly.
SNT.500589.18292	According to Whitley, certain atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed and humidity, must be right before the large scale treatments can occur.
SNT.500589.18293	He explained two treatments per week is more often than usual for the city.
SNT.500589.18294	"With the concerns in Dallas, we're taking it seriously", Whitley added.
SNT.500589.18295	Even in the drier climate found in Abilene, mosquitos recently tested were carrying the virus.
SNT.500589.18296	As a result, that city has increased its pesticide treatments.
SNT.500589.18297	Media sources indicate well over 80 cases of West Nile virus have been reported this year in Dallas county alone.
SNT.500589.18298	A top-ranking Dallas county official told media he views the problem with serious concern.
SNT.500589.18299	There have been nine cases of West Nile virus in the Houston region, with one of those resulting in death.
SNT.500589.18300	A New Jersey woman who is a former resident of Lubbock told media earlier this month she'd contracted the virus and believed she'd been bitten while visiting Austin.
SNT.500589.18301	About 60 percent of West Nile cases in the U.S. happen in Texas.
SNT.500589.18302	Historically, there have been some objections raised over aerial spraying and the potential health hazards distributing such chemicals may pose.
SNT.500589.18303	A California study, however, showed evidence that in areas where aerial spraying occurred, infection was six times less likely to occur.
SNT.500589.18304	The earliest cases of the virus appeared in the U.S. in the late 1990s.
SNT.141682.18305	Initial results gave Afghan President Hamid Karzai more than the 50% of votes necessary to re-elect him in the country's recent presidential elections.
SNT.141682.18306	However, after a month of speculation about vote-rigging, officials from the United Nations-backed Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) have discounted ballots from 210 polling stations.
SNT.141682.18307	European Union observers have claimed that as many as one in four votes may be in doubt.
SNT.141682.18308	The Afghanistan ECC has published a report about their investigation into allegations which emerged after the polls two months ago.
SNT.141682.18309	The EEC has stated that there was "clear and convincing evidence of fraud" at polling stations throughout the country.
SNT.141682.18310	As the ECC reports to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) no official announcement has been made yet, although by law the IEC is obliged to accept the EEC findings; however foreign diplomats have suggested that the IEC may not accept the findings.
SNT.141682.18311	President Karzai has refused to accept the investigation's findings, which reduce his share of the vote from around 55% to under 50%, leading to what Mohammad Moin Marastyal, one of the campaign team members, describes as "deadlock".
SNT.141682.18312	Marastyal claims that the EEC deliberately altered the facts to force a runoff.
SNT.141682.18313	"Effort has been made to lower Karzai's vote to below 50 per cent," he stated.
SNT.98257.18314	The 2008 Taipei Game Show, organized by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), ended on Monday, and was different from shows of past years.
SNT.98257.18315	This could be seen in the gaming population, industry, and exhibition arrangements.
SNT.99997.18316	The Indonesian province of Aceh was struck by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake at 3:08 PM local time (8:08 AM GMT).
SNT.99997.18317	The epicentre was 319 km (198 miles) off the coast of Sumatra, close to the island of Simeulue.
SNT.99997.18318	At least three people have been killed and several buildings have been damaged.
SNT.99997.18319	The same region was hit by an earthquake in 2004, that triggered a tsunami.
SNT.99997.18320	According to local citizens the quake lasted about one minute and was felt in Banda Aceh, the province capital, approximately 300 km (185 mls) away, also in Meulaboh and Gunung Sitoli on Nias island.
SNT.99997.18321	The U.S. Geological Survey, that reported the earthquake, says that no local tsunami warning has been issued.
SNT.99997.18322	Minutes after the quake hit, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning that parts of the Sumatran coast were at risk of a possible tsunami but was later cancelled.
SNT.99997.18323	Japan's meteorological agency said India's Andaman and Nicobar island chain was also at risk.
SNT.99997.18324	Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency recorded at least two aftershocks about 20 minutes after the first tremors, one measuring 5.5 and the other 5.3 on the Richter scale.
SNT.99997.18325	Budi Waluyo, an official at the National Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the quake occurred about 30 kilometres beneath the ground.
SNT.99997.18326	The US Geological Survey measured the quake at 7.6 on the Richter scale.
SNT.99997.18327	"The quake has no tsunami potential because it's happening under the ground, not the sea," Waluyo said.
SNT.85030.18328	It just wasn't their day for the two baseball teams on either side of the Straight, as China Stars and Uni-President Lions were both eliminated in a route at the Konami Cup 2007.
SNT.85030.18329	The final of Konami Cup will take place between SK Wyverns and Chunichi Dragons.
SNT.189815.18330	Lead poisoning has taken the lives of at least 163 individuals in the northern Nigerian state of Zamfara in recent weeks.
SNT.189815.18331	Sometime during March residents of remote villages began illegally mining gold in areas of high lead concentration.
SNT.189815.18332	There have been a total of 355 reported cases, setting the fatality rate at 46%.
SNT.189815.18333	According to Henry Akpan, chief epidemiologist at Nigeria's Ministry of Health, 111 of the 163 recorded deaths have been children, many only several years old.
SNT.189815.18334	Akpan further said that officials had seen young children playing in contaminated water located near the mining sites.
SNT.189815.18335	The government had found through their yearly immunization program that there were almost no children living in the villages of Zamfara.
SNT.189815.18336	Adults from the area reported that the children had died of malaria.
SNT.189815.18337	However, after an investigation, health officials concluded that there was an abnormally large amount of lead circulating in the villagers' bodies.
SNT.189815.18338	Nigeria's government has requested assistance from international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in averting a widespread outbreak.
SNT.189815.18339	The Ministry has meanwhile organized two camps for villagers suffering from the poison.
SNT.629745.18340	The South African government has reported that former President Nelson Mandela has been discharged from a hospital in Pretoria, where he was hospitalised December 8. 
SNT.629745.18341	Mandela received hospital treatment for gallstones and a lung infection.
SNT.629745.18342	Presidential spokesperson Mac Maharaj said Mandela "will undergo home-based high care at his Houghton home until he recovers fully".
SNT.629745.18343	Mandela was hospitalised for eighteen days, his longest hospitalisation since 1990, when he was released from prison after 27 years.
SNT.629745.18344	Current president Jacob Zuma visited Mandela in hospital this past weekend.
SNT.629745.18345	Zuma visited Mandela again on Christmas, as did Graca Machel, Mandela's wife.
SNT.629745.18346	Mandela has been hospitalised three times since the start of last year.
SNT.629745.18347	In January 2011, Mandela received hospital treatment for an acute respiratory infection.
SNT.629745.18348	Work at a Robben Island limestone quarry, where he was imprisoned for sixteen years during South Africa's Apartheid, damaged his eyes and lungs.
SNT.629745.18349	During the 1980s, while still a prisoner on Robben Island, he developed .
SNT.629745.18350	Maharaj, once a political prisoner alongside Mandela during Apartheid, expressed thanks for public and media support and allowing Mandela privacy.
SNT.629745.18351	On behalf of the government, Maharaj also asked for a "continuation of the privacy in order to allow for the best possible conditions for full recovery".
SNT.29797.18352	According to the Bureau of Meteorology, (BOM) 2005 was the hottest year since reliable, widespread temperature observations became available in 1910.
SNT.29797.18353	Data collected by the Bureau show Australia's annual mean temperature for 2005 was 1.09°C above the standard 1961-90 average.
SNT.29797.18354	The Bureau of Meteorology says the result is more evidence of climate change.
SNT.29797.18355	The Bureau's Blair Trewin said: "We've seen things like the general retreat of the winter snow line."
SNT.29797.18356	"We've seen a marked decrease in the frequency of frost, especially in inland Queensland," Dr Trewin said.
SNT.29797.18357	"We've seen an increase in the number of extreme hot days."
SNT.29797.18358	"All the projections we have from climate models we would expect to see continued warming through the 21st century," he said.
SNT.29797.18359	"Numbers like this ... are another piece of evidence that climate change is real and it's a real issue."
SNT.29797.18360	Despite unseasonably cool weather in the South West of Western Australia, 2005 was a hot year over most of the nation, with the Northern Territory (NT) bearing the brunt.
SNT.29797.18361	The NT area-average maximum temperature was 1.45°C above the long-term mean, the largest anomaly of any state or territory.
SNT.29797.18362	The Bureau says that while these temperature departures may seem relatively small, a 1°C increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern Australian towns shifting northward by about 100km.
SNT.29797.18363	All States and Territories, apart from Victoria and Tasmania, recorded 2005 mean temperatures amongst their top two warmest years on record.
SNT.29797.18364	The only region recording a cooler than normal year was a coastal strip of Western Australia extending from Cape Leeuwin to Carnarvon.
SNT.29797.18365	Australia's previous warmest years on record were influenced by significant El Niño events, say the Bureau.
SNT.29797.18366	However, no such event occurred in 2005, making the record warmth even more unusual.
SNT.29797.18367	Since 1979, all but four years have been warmer than average in Australia.
SNT.29797.18368	Australian temperatures have increased by approximately 0.9ºC since 1910 - consistent with global warming trends.
SNT.29797.18369	Scientific studies have linked global and Australian temperature increases to the enhanced greenhouse effect.
SNT.29797.18370	The early months of 2005 were also very dry over much of Australia with the January-May period being the 2nd driest on record.
SNT.29797.18371	Australia's area-averaged rainfall is calculated from a network of around 5000 rainfall stations.
SNT.29797.18372	Observations from this network reveal that, when compared to historical records, Tasmania was the wettest State in 2005, while Queensland and Western Australia were the driest.
SNT.29797.18373	Over the New Year bushfires have caused havoc in many parts of Australia, with houses, farm stock devastated.
SNT.29797.18374	Thousands of hectares of bushland and farmland have been burnt out.
SNT.29797.18375	Environmentalists say the weather is a precursor of things to come: "2005 gave us a little taste of what life will be like if we fail to tackle climate change," Greenpeace's Catherine Fitzpatrick said.
SNT.29797.18376	"The extreme heat and bushfires of New Year's Day 2006 showed that it isn't going to be fun."
SNT.29797.18377	"If action isn't taken soon to avoid catastrophic climate change, Australians will have John Howard to blame for failing to act when he had the chance."
SNT.29797.18378	Ms Fitzpatrick said the Federal Government was as beholden to the coal and aluminium industries as the Japanese government was to whaling companies, and with far more devastating impacts.
SNT.29797.18379	"Today's figures should spur our Environment Minister ... to real action – ratify Kyoto, quit coal and move towards clean, renewable energy," Ms Fitzpatrick said.
SNT.29797.18380	Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he recognised climate change was the biggest modern-day environmental challenge.
SNT.29797.18381	"I think that climate change is alarming," he said on ABC radio.
SNT.29797.18382	"I regard climate change as the number one environmental challenge …"
SNT.29797.18383	"These figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real and it's a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve."
SNT.29797.18384	Australia and the United States are the only developed nations to have refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, which calls on countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.
SNT.29797.18385	The Government argues Kyoto will not work because it does not commit developing nations to reducing emissions.
SNT.29797.18386	"It only covers just over a third of the countries of the world and ... we need something that includes all countries of the world," said Senator Campbell.
SNT.29797.18387	Many regions across the globe also reported an exceptionally warm year.
SNT.29797.18388	According to a preliminary estimate released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global mean temperature for 2005 was about 0.48°C above normal, putting 2005 amongst the four warmest years globally since records commenced in 1861.
SNT.179198.18389	The aftershock reached a magnitude of 5.9 with the epicenter located nineteen kilometers west of Pichilemu, according to the University of Chile Geological Survey (UCGS).
SNT.179198.18390	However, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that it reached a magnitude of 5.8; had a depth of 8,5 kilometers; and that the epicenter was located 65 kilometers at the southwest of San Antonio, Valparaíso; 100 kilometers at the west of Rancagua, O'Higgins 105 kilometers at the northwest of Curicó, Maule and; 135 kilometers at the southwest of Santiago, Metropolitan Region.
SNT.108446.18391	United States glam metal band Poison is suing Capitol Records and EMI Music Marketing over an alleged breach of contract.
SNT.108446.18392	Poison claim the two companies have underpaid them royalties for years.
SNT.108446.18393	The band claims Capitol miscategorized various record sales and miscalculated every possible expense since the 1980s.
SNT.108446.18394	They say when attempting to check company records they received no co-operation and are now asking a judge to order the firms to reveal their records so the band can determine how much they are owed.
SNT.103568.18395	New signing Laurent Robert and the return of Greg Sutton were not enough for Toronto F.C. as they fell 4-1 to D.C. United in Washington.
SNT.103568.18396	Early goals from Luciano Emilio and Santino Quaranta left Toronto in an uphill battle for the rest of the match.
SNT.103568.18397	The hill only became bigger in the 22nd minute when Kevin Harmse put in a hard challenge on Gonzalo Peralta and was subsequently sent off.
SNT.103568.18398	Marcelo Gallardo then made it 3-0 for the home side in the 52nd minute.
SNT.103568.18399	Quaranta crossed the ball and Gallardo was wide open to smash the ball into an open net.
SNT.103568.18400	Jaime Moreno capped off the scoring for D.C. in the 78th before Edu opened Toronto's MLS account with his first goal of the season.
SNT.103568.18401	The loss leaves Toronto at 0-2-0 on the season, while DC pick up their first win after losing their opener.
SNT.103568.18402	DC now travel to play Real Salt Lake, while Toronto will visit David Beckham and the L.A. Galaxy.
SNT.99738.18403	Between the debate and the first voting round Bobošíková withdrew her candidacy, citing a lack of support for her.
SNT.971234.18404	Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center, Bangkok — Wikinews interviewed Georgia Inglis, of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders.
SNT.971234.18405	The Gliders are in Bangkok, Thailand, for the Asia-Oceania Zone Wheelchair Basketball Championships, which are being held at the Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center.
SNT.971234.18406	They are hoping to qualify for the World Championships, which are being held in Toronto, Canada, in June next year.
SNT.971234.18407	Inglis is one of two new players in the team.
SNT.971234.18408	Wikinews caught up with her before the Gliders' match against China.
SNT.115141.18409	The United States 2008 federal deficit has reached a record high, US$454.8 billion—more than double last year's deficit.
SNT.115141.18410	Financial experts believe that next year, the deficit will reach over $700 billion, while the National Debt Clock has recently run out of digits to record over $10 trillion in national debt.
SNT.115141.18411	The deficit is now equivalent to 3.2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States, with the government's total income being 17.8% of GDP, and total outlays being equivalent to 21% of GDP.
SNT.115141.18412	Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson blamed the deficit on the housing market, related markets, and slow growth.
SNT.115141.18413	He said the news would "reinforce the need to not only address short-term challenges, but pursue policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility, and address entitlement reform".
SNT.115141.18414	Democrats like Senator Kent Conrad, however, placed the blame on "President Bush's failed policies".
SNT.115141.18415	"The reality is that the next president will be inheriting a fiscal and economic mess of historic proportions," said Conrad, adding that "it will take years to dig our way out".
SNT.115141.18416	Another Democrat, House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt, also blamed the Bush administration.
SNT.115141.18417	"The eight years of this administration will include the five biggest budget deficits in history," he said.
SNT.115141.18418	"The resulting debt will be passed to our children and grandchildren."
SNT.115141.18419	Jim Nussle, director of the Office of Management and Budget said that he believes that the deficit will start to decline.
SNT.115141.18420	"The bipartisan stimulus bill and the slow economy are the primary reasons for the increase in deficit as reflected in this year's budget results."
SNT.115141.18421	"This increase reinforces the need to adopt and maintain policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility, including entitlement reform and pro-growth tax policies."
SNT.115141.18422	"I am confident the economy can return to stronger growth with a declining deficit—after working through current challenges if Congress limits wasteful and excessive spending."
SNT.49881.18423	The special TADA court hearing the 1993 Mumbai blasts case began delivering its verdict today.
SNT.49881.18424	Four members of the Memon family, Yakub, Essa, Rubina and Yusuf, were found guilty of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism and also having contacts with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, and now face between 5 years and life in prison.
SNT.49881.18425	The judge decided to acquit three other Memons, Suleiman, Hanifa and Raheen, giving them the benefit of the doubt.
SNT.49881.18426	Yakub, younger brother of prime accused Ibrahim Mushtaq 'Tiger' Memon, was also convicted of possessing unauthorised arms.
SNT.49881.18427	The rest of the accused, including Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, will hear the judgements in their cases over a period of four weeks.
SNT.49881.18428	After hearing the court's ruling against him, Yakub lost his temper, hurling abuses at the judge and accusing him of "making terrorists out of innocents".
SNT.49881.18429	After the blasts, which killed over 250 people in 13 explosions across the city, the Memon family fled to Dubai, and then Pakistan.
SNT.49881.18430	Except Tiger and his brother Ayub, however, the rest of them returned to India in 1994, and were arrested by the CBI.
SNT.49881.18431	Since then, Yakub has been in custody and has, according to his lawyer Subhash Kanse, been undergoing treatment for depression.
SNT.72966.18432	England have beaten West Indies by five wickets in the second Twenty20 international of the West Indies tour of England at The Oval, London, England.
SNT.72966.18433	England's victory tied the two match series 1-1 after West Indies won the first Twenty20 yesterday.
SNT.72966.18434	Chris Gayle got the West Indies off to a good start with 61 runs off 37 balls, but the England bowlers and fielders restricted their score to 169-7 after 20 overs despite some big hits from Marlon Samuels.
SNT.72966.18435	In reply, England faltered, losing three wickets in 14 balls followed by the dismissal of Kevin Pietersen for 19.
SNT.72966.18436	However Owais Shah scored 55 to help England past the target.
SNT.72966.18437	The tour now moves on to a series of three One-Day International matches starting on 1st July.
SNT.72966.18438	Earlier in the tour, England won a four match Test series 3-0.
SNT.504776.18439	London, England — Yesterday Wikinews had the opportunity to tour the Ottobrock wheelchair repair workshops at the Paralympic Village in London.
SNT.504776.18440	It is one of a network of workshops at every Paralympic venue.
SNT.504776.18441	They are run by Ottobrock, which has been repairing wheelchairs at the Paralympics since 1988.
SNT.504776.18442	The workshop opened on August 22 and will remain until September 10.
SNT.504776.18443	They liken themselves to the pit crew of motor sport — except that they have no idea what sort of equipment they will have to work with.
SNT.504776.18444	The store room contains 15,000 spare parts, with everything from spare carbon fibre running blades to spare tyres — over 2,000 of them.
SNT.504776.18445	They stock Ottobrock parts and their competitors' too, as they have no idea what will arrive at the workshop next.
SNT.504776.18446	Athletes from around the world bring in all manner of equipment.
SNT.504776.18447	The prosthetic technicians have to deal with everything from flat tyres to broken spokes to full-scale rebuilds.
SNT.504776.18448	They frequently collaborate on determining how best to effect a repair.
SNT.504776.18449	The objective is to get the wheelchair repaired and back in service as soon as possible.
SNT.504776.18450	Those for wheelchair basketball and rugby have cambered wheels so they can spin around.
SNT.504776.18451	Ottobrock has a welding workshop where frames are repaired; the teams' equipment managers understandably cannot bring such heavy equipment with them to the games, so they rely on the workshops.
SNT.504776.18452	When a repair job is required, it is often required in a hurry.
SNT.504776.18453	At the Turkey vs United States game, a chair was repaired during the match.
SNT.504776.18454	In addition to wheelchairs, the workshops handle all manner of work with prostheses.
SNT.504776.18455	The Chinese Boccia team brought in its power chairs to have the electronics adjusted.
SNT.504776.18456	In that sport, having the controls working perfectly is all-important.
SNT.125417.18457	Close to 6,500 civilians have been killed and many thousands more wounded in the past three months during heavy fighting in Sri Lanka, according to a report by the United Nations.
SNT.125417.18458	Earlier this year, the army launched a crackdown on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) to oust them from their territory in the northeastern part of Sri Lanka, which the rebels have occupied for several years.
SNT.125417.18459	The rebels have now been forced back to a small coastal strip, where about fifty thousand people have been trapped after the area was evacuated of 100,000 people.
SNT.125417.18460	Thangamuttu Sathyamurthi, a government health official in the war zone, reported that people were dying of starvation, and that there was a large deficit of medicine and food.
SNT.125417.18461	According to the medical relief group Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders), many of the people who had fled the conflict zone had gunshot and blast wounds.
SNT.125417.18462	The government has accused the Tamil Tiger rebels of using civilians as human shields, a claim that the rebels deny.
SNT.125417.18463	The rebels have accused the Sri Lankan army of randomly shelling civilian areas.
SNT.125417.18464	The U.N. says that the rate of civilian deaths in the country has risen sharply.
SNT.125417.18465	On average, 33 civilians were killed per day at the end of January.
SNT.125417.18466	The number has now increased to an average 116 per day.
SNT.81311.18467	Quarterback Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers broke Dan Marino's record for career touchdown passes on Sunday, throwing number 421 to receiver Greg Jennings with 4:56 left in the first quarter.
SNT.81311.18468	The recordbreaking pass was a 16-yard slant route, and Favre had to throw a bullet to complete it.
SNT.81311.18469	Though the game was being played at the Metrodome, even the Minnesota Vikings fans stood and applauded as Favre celebrated with his teammates.
SNT.81311.18470	After the announcement of the record was made, a taped message from Marino played on the Jumbotron.
SNT.81311.18471	"I'd like to take a minute to congratulate you on breaking one of the great records in sports."
SNT.81311.18472	"I loved holding the touchdown record for the past 13 years, but if someone was going to break it, I'm glad it was someone like you, who has always competed at the highest level and always played only to win," said Marino.
SNT.81311.18473	"Over the past 17 years, you've been a credit to the Packers, and to the National Football League and to the sport that we all love so much."
SNT.81311.18474	This historic event came just two weeks after Favre broke John Elway's record for career wins by a quarterback, defeating the New York Giants for win number 149.
SNT.81311.18475	The Green Bay icon also holds the records for career completions and consecutive games started by a quarterback, which continued on Sunday at 241.
SNT.81311.18476	Later in the second quarter of today's game, Favre threw the 8,359th pass of his career, eclipsing another of Marino's records.
SNT.81311.18477	When asked about the record after the game, a subdued Favre said,"It's just a number."
SNT.81311.18478	"I'm more proud of the fact that we won this game..."
SNT.81311.18478-1	"I'm pleased it's over, and I'm honored."
SNT.81311.18479	"To play this long, I think, is a special thing and to achieve this is, uh, very special,".
SNT.81311.18480	He added that, in his mind, Dan Marino is still the best quarterback of all time.
SNT.204267.18481	ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna), a separatist group based out of the Basque region of northern Spain, announced in a recorded and written message that it would end its armed campaign for independence, instead focusing on political means for achieving its goals.
SNT.204267.18482	In the video sent to the BBC, ETA stated that, while the autonomy framework enshrined in the Spanish constitution is "not the way to satisfy the wishes of the Basque people", the organisation was committed to finding a democratic solution to the conflict.
SNT.204267.18483	Several analysts have suggested that this most recent ceasefire is based on ETA's tactics causing their support in the Basque region to plummet.
SNT.204267.18484	Author Paddy Woodworth found in a recent trip to the region that the group's actions had made former supporters of the movement believe ETA was politically finished.
SNT.204267.18485	The BBC's Sarah Rainsford said that ETA is at the weakest point in its 51-year history and that the ceasefire may just be a ploy to disguise that weakness.
SNT.204267.18486	The group, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States, have declared ceasefires several times before, which have all ended in a resumption of violence.
SNT.204267.18487	The most recent ceasefire, in 2006, led to peace talks between the group and the Spanish government, but they were interrupted by a car-bombing at Madrid's Barajas Airport.
SNT.204267.18488	The bombing was frowned upon by all involved in the peace process, including other Basque separatist parties in the region.
SNT.21605.18489	On Friday, all six major American television networks; ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, WB, and UPN, along with most PBS stations, united in a rare show of solidarity to air a one hour charity concert called Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast.
SNT.21605.18490	The concert aired live at 8pm in the Eastern time zone and 7pm in the Central time zone and on tape-delay in the Mountain and Pacific time zones.
SNT.21605.18491	It was also shown on the Internet and many cable networks such as USA, Bravo and G4.
SNT.21605.18492	The show was produced by Joel Gallen, the same man behind the September 11th tribute concert America: A Tribute to Heroes.
SNT.21605.18493	The show was not censored for political statements but was for obscenities.
SNT.21605.18494	Last week, rapper Kayne West made a remark on an NBC charity show A Concert for Hurricane Relief, in which West claimed that "George Bush doesn't care about black people.", which caused controversy.
SNT.21605.18495	Throughout the concert there were notable acts, such U2 performing "One" with Mary.
SNT.21605.18496	Another moment was Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood and the house band from The Late Show with David Letterman doing a cover of John Fogerty's "Who'll Stop The Rain".
SNT.21605.18497	Donations were being solicited for the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
SNT.21605.18498	Telecom company AT&T provided toll-free calling and 10 call centers for the event and MCI provided volunteers from their call centers.
SNT.21605.18499	BET also held a charity concert called S.O.S (Saving OurSelves), a half-hour before cutting to the main one.
SNT.21605.18500	MTV, MTV Overdrive, VH1 and CMT will air a charity show Saturday called ReAct Now: Music & Relief.
SNT.422617.18501	Ian Alleyne, host of Trinidad TV show Crime Watch, has been charged with crimes under the Sexual Offences Act after a tape purporting to show a mentally ill teenage girl being raped was allegedly broadcast last year.
SNT.422617.18502	The footage allegedly was on-air thrice last October and triggered multiple complaints to police.
SNT.422617.18503	 Caribbean Communications Network's (CCN's) channel TV6 is jointly charged under the same act as Alleyne, as well as under the Telecommunications Act. 
SNT.422617.18504	Alleyne has been hospitalised following his arrest, owing to chest pains.
SNT.422617.18505	He is due to go before a magistrate, and cannot receive bail until he does so.
SNT.422617.18506	Police had visited CCN offices in Port of Spain twice last year seeking the tape.
SNT.422617.18507	Alleyne issued a message to The Trinidad Express criticising the decision not to grant him bail until he appears in court.
SNT.422617.18508	He said it "is really a sad state of affairs on the part of the police."
SNT.422617.18509	"What have I done that they have seen it fit to ensure that I'm only granted bail before a magistrate?"
SNT.48677.18510	Mexico's electoral court has unanimously rejected claims of massive fraud in the July 2nd presidential election and reported that the partial recount ordered at the end of last month has not changed the original result of a narrow victory for conservative candidate Felipe Calderon of the National Action Party (PAN).
SNT.48677.18511	Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), continues to insist that the election was rigged and has vowed to continue fighting the result.
SNT.48677.18512	Lopez Obrador has rejected the ruling and suggested forming a rival parallel government.
SNT.48677.18513	There is no legal avenue to appeal the court's ruling, in except of the 39th article of the Mexican Constitution which states: "The sovereignty of the state resides on the citizens."
SNT.48677.18514	"The citizens have always the righ to change or to modify its government", article that has been claimed by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as a right to summon a National Democratic Convention.
SNT.48677.18515	The seven judges have until August 31 to resolve all complaints and until September 6 to officially declare a president-elect or annul the elections.
SNT.48677.18516	Lopez Obrador has led massive protests in Mexico City over the past month demanding a full recount.
SNT.48677.18517	"Never more will we accept that an illegal and illegitimate government is installed in our country," he told thousands of supporters following the ruling calling upon them to never accept Calderon as president and to decide if he should form a parallel government and (or) continue nationwide protests.
SNT.48677.18518	Leonel Castillo, the president of the tribunal, said Lopez Obrador's claims of massive fraud "turned out to be completely unfounded."
SNT.48677.18519	Lopez Obrador's election team had filed complaints at 50,000 polling stations but the court ordered a recount at only 11,839 stations or 9% of all voting locations following massive street protests.
SNT.48677.18520	Calderon won the intial ballot count by a margion of less than 0.6%
SNT.97759.18521	Australia will press on with plans to withdraw its troops from Iraq in June this year, although promises were made by the nation's foreign minister that relations with the United States will not be affected by the move.
SNT.97759.18522	Foreign minister Stephen Smith said that the withdrawal will be conducted in an orderly fashion to minimise inconvenience to other nations in Iraq.
SNT.97759.18523	Speaking in New York as part of his first US visit since the election he said "We want to do that in a way which sees minimal disruption, which causes the least inconvenience to our allies there, both the United States and the United Kingdom."
SNT.97759.18524	On Monday Smith will meet with Condoleezza Rice and others to discuss Afghanistan, where Australia also has troops stationed.
SNT.97759.18525	It is currently the intention for this to remain the case.
SNT.97759.18526	Smith said of the effect on relations with the US - which have been strong since World War II - "It's not something which I believe will disturb what to date has been a very good working relationship between the new government and the (U.S.) administration."
SNT.97759.18527	"It's a very strong alliance - an alliance which transcends changes in governments."
SNT.97759.18528	"Administrations come and go, governments come and go, but the alliance is a long-term, enduring fundamental relationship between our two nations."
SNT.97759.18529	The confirmation is important as Australia saw a new government elected in November.
SNT.97759.18530	Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (Labour) defeated Conservative head and former PM John Howard.
SNT.97759.18531	Howard is a supporter of US President George W. Bush and his government.
SNT.44135.18532	Germany beat Argentina 4-2 on penalties to book a place in the Fifa World Cup semi-finals in Berlin, Friday.
SNT.44135.18533	The match had drawn 1-1 without many clear chances for either side due to defensive play on both sides.
SNT.44135.18534	First it was Germany who were unable to be positive as Argentina dominated play with 65 per cent of ball possession.
SNT.44135.18535	Four minutes after half-time Roberto Ayala got across Miroslav Klose to meet Juan Riquelme's corner which he powered between Jens Lehmann and his near post guard, Philipp Lahm.
SNT.44135.18536	The goal early in the second period made for a more exciting match which had been mostly uneventful in a first half during which neither side could muster more than a single shot.
SNT.44135.18537	Juergen Klinsmann may be credited with a substitution change that partially helped Germany get an equalising goal.
SNT.44135.18538	The fast David Odonkor troubled Juan Sorin and the Argentine left flank and allowed Germany to press forward nearer to the opposition penalty area.
SNT.44135.18539	Argentine manager may also have made a tactical mistake and suffered form a moment of bad fortune.
SNT.44135.18540	In the minutes before Germany equalised from Ballack's wonderful left field cross his goalkeeper had to be stretchered off with a muscle injury.
SNT.44135.18541	Jose Pekerman followed his keeper's substitutions with two defensive ones; taking off creative midfield playmaker Riquelme and forward Hernan Crespo.
SNT.44135.18542	The gifts of Lionel Messi and Javier Saviola were left on the bench while Julio Cruz, a long ball-holding forward, was brought on to partner Carlos Tevez.
SNT.44135.18543	The bad luck and changes seemed to put Germany in charge of the tactical game for the first time in the match.
SNT.44135.18544	A minute after Cruz arrived Pekerman might have regretted his decision.
SNT.44135.18545	Klose's fifth World Cup goal ten minutes from time put him at the top of the Fifa Golden Boot leader board as the tournament's highest goalscorer.
SNT.44135.18546	He beat his marker to dip and head beyond Leonardo Franco after Tim Borowski, a substitution on 74 minutes, had flicked on a Ballack cross.
SNT.44135.18547	The game finished 1-1 and the two halves of extra time mirrored the match; first half uneventful, the second half more attacking.
SNT.44135.18548	Fabricio Coloccini came closest to breaking the deadlock when he hit the crossbar from 45 yards trying to catch Lehmann off his goal line.
SNT.44135.18549	Neither Germany or Argentina had lost in a World Cup penalty contest; both sides had won three.
SNT.44135.18550	All the penalties hit the target and were well struck, except Ayala's who hit a soft effort which Lehmann saved to his left.
SNT.44135.18551	Cambiasso's effort to Lehmann's left was better struck but the keeper had guessed the right side to dive to break Argentine hearts.
SNT.44135.18552	FIFA launched an investigation into an on-field melee which began after the penalties had been decided in Germany's favour.
SNT.44135.18553	Unused Argentine substitute Leandro Cufre assaulted German Per Mertesacker and was presented the red card by Lubos Michel.
SNT.44135.18554	According to the German captain Michael Ballack the conflict originated when Argentine players shouted at the German team during the shootout.

SNT.187266.18586	Researchers don't blame specific brands, but bottled water in general.
SNT.187266.18587	A random study found unusually high rates of heterotrophic bacteria in the bottled water, more than 500 cfu, the legal limit set by United States Pharmacopeia on how much bacteria should be present in drinking water in Canada.

SNT.187266.18589	“Heterotrophic bacteria counts in some of the bottles were found to be in revolting figures of (100) times more than the permitted limit,” said Sonish Azam, a Canadian researcher involved in the study, “This amount of bacteria is alarming, as if we are ingesting a cup of culture.” 
SNT.187266.18589-1	“Microbiologically speaking,” she said, “tap water is purer than bottled water — most bottled water.
SNT.187266.18590	The bacteria are not very harmful to an average person, but many sensitive groups, such as the young, sick or elderly, could get sick from it.

SNT.30061.18640	"She was very pale" he said, "We were diverted right away and were able to be on the scene within minutes and were able to have the patient at hospital within an hour of the attack."
SNT.30061.18641	"She had life threatening injuries she had lost significant amounts of blood and the patient had what we would call an altered level of consciousness where it wasn't able to communicate directly with the patient" said Queensland Ambulance paramedic Lachlan Parker.

SNT.110977.18675	The latest advertisement for United States Republican presidential candidate John McCain is questioning Democrat Barack Obama's benefit to families.
SNT.110977.18676	Last week the BBC reported that the McCain campaign had released an advertisement comparing Obama to American celebrities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, calling him "the biggest celebrity in the world."
SNT.110977.18677	McCain's newest advertisement, released early this week, continues along those same lines.
SNT.110977.18678	"Is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family?" the narrator asks, according to The Boston Globe and a video of the ad displayed on its website.
SNT.110977.18679	With images of wind turbines in the background, the narrator says, "Renewable energy to transform our economy, create jobs and energy independence, that's John McCain."
SNT.110977.18680	The Boston Globe reports that McCain's latest ad does not acknowledge that Obama's economic policy, especially the proposed rollback of current president George W. Bush's capital gains tax cuts, would largely affect the wealthiest of America, not the middle class.
SNT.110977.18681	Obama, the BBC reports, is quoted as calling McCain "cynical," "desperate" and "in the pocket of Big Oil."
SNT.110977.18682	The latest Obama video, shown on the USA Today website, touts McCain as "just more of the same" politics employed by George W. Bush.
SNT.110977.18683	The ad cites a May 22, 2003 Fox News Channel interview where McCain says "the President and I agree on most issues."
SNT.110977.18684	"There was a recent study that showed I voted with the President over 90 percent of the time."

SNT.110977.18687	"America has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world," he plans to say, according to prepared remarks issued by his campaign, and released by The Boston Globe.
SNT.110977.18688	"Is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas when we are taxing them out of the country? "
SNT.110977.18688-1	"Unfortunately Senator Obama's plans would raise taxes on businesses even more.”
SNT.110977.18689	"He has promised tax increases on income, tax increases on investment, tax increases on small businesses."
SNT.110977.18690	"Raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs."
SNT.110977.18691	"Is the biggest proponent of George Bush’s tired, failed policies ready to bring about change? "
SNT.110977.18691-1	"Another day brings another dishonest attack from John McCain."
SNT.110977.18692	"While Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95% of American families, what he’s not telling us is that he wants to give $4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies, continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas, and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class families."
SNT.110977.18693	"It’s time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to America."

SNT.38044.18733	On the ninth day of the hunger strike she and two other activists had undertaken to protest the Indian government's decision to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam across the Narmada river and the lack of progress in rehabilitating people displaced by the dam project. 
SNT.38044.18733-1	Patkar was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where she was placed under intensive care.
SNT.38044.18734	Doctors have said that she is conscious and her condition is stable.
SNT.38044.18735	Police sources say that Patkar has not been arrested as of now, but an First Information Report has been lodged against her for attempting to commit suicide.
SNT.38044.18736	Activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan tried to prevent the police from moving Patkar and some were arrested on rioting charges.
SNT.118937.18737	Over 100 Australian Jews, including two authors and a federal minister, have condemned Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip.
SNT.118937.18738	The 113 signatories are members of a group known as Independent Australian Jewish Voices (IAJV).
SNT.118937.18739	Antony Loewenstein, the groups founder, told The Age that he expected outrage from the loudest Jewish voices.
SNT.118937.18740	But the IAJV had found a sizeable minority of Australian Jews who valued an independent perspective as opposed to the blindly pro-Israel position.
SNT.118937.18741	"However, since Palestinians have no means of self-defence against the most powerful military force in the Middle East."
SNT.118937.18742	"We particularly call on Israel to end its brutal assault on the vulnerable Palestinian people of Gaza and to reconsider its rejection of the United Nations Security Council's call for a ceasefire," the statement said.
SNT.118937.18743	"History has demonstrated that military punishment has never broken the spirit of a people or produced peace," added the statement.
SNT.118937.18744	"It would only inflame hatred of Jews and of Israel, while doing nothing to protect the lives of Israelis."
SNT.118937.18745	"Above all, it would undermine attempts to work with peace-seeking Palestinians for a lasting, just solution."
SNT.118937.18746	Colin Rubenstein, executive director of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, said the statement was up to Mr Loewenstein's "usual form — totally wrong on every fact, totally unbalanced, and totally insensitive to Israeli suffering".
SNT.118937.18747	"They propose that the population of southern Israel must continue to live under constant rocket bombardment, opposing all practical efforts to actually invoke the right to self-defence the signatories say they recognize," he said.
SNT.98473.18748	Some flu viruses in the United States and Canada have shown increased levels of resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir), the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.
SNT.98473.18749	Tamiflu is currently the recommended treatment for humans infected with bird flu, and governments worldwide have been stockpiling the drug in case of a flu pandemic.
SNT.98473.18750	The drug resistance appears to be limited to the H1N1 variant which causes seasonal flu, while H3N2 or influenza B strains and the H5N1 strain that causes bird flu did not show increased resistance.
SNT.98473.18751	While previous studies showed resistance levels below 1%, samples tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now showed around 5% resistance, and in a Canadian survey of 81 samples, 8 showed resistance.
SNT.98473.18752	The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found 19 cases of resistance among 148 samples from last November.
SNT.98473.18753	In a wider study of 437 H1N1 isolates from 19 countries, the European agency found 59 resistant samples from 9 countries.
SNT.98473.18754	Resistance has not been shown to increase in Japan or Hong Kong.
SNT.98473.18755	The WHO is now contacting national authorities to get more data on flu resistance.
SNT.98473.18756	These viruses have acquired a mutation that makes them resistant, and the WHO statement said that a resistant strain has probably emerged spontaneously.
SNT.98473.18757	The statement added that these mutations would most likely render Tamiflu ineffective for the prevention or treatment of flu caused by resistant H1N1 viruses.
SNT.98473.18758	The WHO also stated that this phenomenon does not influence the effectiveness of flu immunizations.
SNT.98473.18759	Resistant strains have shown no evidence of causing more severe disease or being more easily transmissible.
SNT.55305.18760	The Labour Party's 2005 election manifesto read "We are committed to retaining the independent nuclear deterrent”.
SNT.55305.18761	Although there have been reports that planning and design work on replacement vessels and new designs of nuclear war heads has been proceeding for some years, the first Cabinet meeting to consider this pledge will take place tomorrow.
SNT.55305.18762	No Cabinet papers have been circulated before the meeting at which it is said there will be a “first run round the issues”.
SNT.55305.18763	A further Cabinet meeting is to be held prior to the publication of a White Paper just before Christmas.
SNT.55305.18764	The principle of retaining a nuclear deterrent will be put to the vote in the House of Commons next year and, although it may split the Labour Party, is likely to be carried with the support of the Conservative opposition.
SNT.55305.18765	It is reported that some Cabinet Ministers have reservations about the prudence of maintaining the nuclear deterrent when the apparent threats are from saboteurs and suicide bombers.
SNT.55305.18766	They also have doubts about the legality of adding to the stock of nuclear warheads contrary to the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and about the way that the decision is being pushed through without consultation with the Labour Party.
SNT.55305.18767	Among those with doubts are the Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, Hilary Benn, Minister of State for International Development, and Peter Hain, Secretary of State for Wales and Northern Ireland.
SNT.55305.18768	The only other European country with nuclear capability is France.
SNT.55305.18769	Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown are agreed on the need to retain a nuclear deterrent.
SNT.55305.18770	Their reasons include keeping the country's seat at the top table of international politics.
SNT.55305.18771	The Trident missile system is carried in four nuclear-powered Vanguard class submarines, the first of which was commissioned in August 1993.
SNT.55305.18772	The current Trident system cost £12.6 Bn to introduce at 1996 prices, and requires £280m a year to maintain.
SNT.55305.18773	Replacements for the smaller nuclear-powered w:attack submarines are under construction and will be armed with Tomahawk missile tactical missile systems.
SNT.55305.18774	The atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston is reported to be developing tactical nuclear weapons, smaller and of shorter range than Trident suitable for firing using the same type of launcher as Tomahawks.
SNT.98826.18775	The United States House of Representatives has passed the bipartisan US$152 billion economic stimulus package that gives one-time rebates to United States citizens, US$600 for individuals or US$1,200 for couples plus US$300 for each child.
SNT.98826.18776	US$300 checks would be sent to people on low-income including retirees on Social Security which was not included in the original bill backed by President George W. Bush.
SNT.98826.18777	The plan would begin to decrease rebates for citizens with taxable incomes of US$75,000 for individuals and US$150,000 for couples.
SNT.98826.18778	The checks would go out to more than a 130 million Americans according to Treasury secretary Henry Paulson.
SNT.98826.18779	The House overwhelmingly approved the more broad Senate amended bill which included the low-income portion mentioned above along with provisions that would keep illegal aliens from receiving a rebate check.
SNT.98826.18780	Despite some opposition from some Congressmen, such as John B. T. Campbell III of California's 48th congressional district, the plan passed overwhelmingly 380–34.
SNT.98826.18781	Campbell called the plan "wealth redistribution" and noted it did not have safeguards to prevent illegals from receiving these rebates and also claimed that stimulus plan would increase the deficit more and noted the cause of the looming recession was because of "credit problems."
SNT.98826.18782	The United States Senate voted hours earlier on the bill which passed in the Senate, 81–16. after having to shed some incentives included by Senate Democrats which caused the bill to fail.
SNT.98826.18783	Some of the incentives that were left out of the plan in a compromise to gain Republican support were demands for benefits for long-term unemployed workers and stipulation that would allow low-income citizens to pay off heating bills and let home builders pay off losses off the current year against previous tax years.
SNT.98826.18784	President Bush approved of the package, noting in a statement, "This plan is robust, broad-based, timely, and it will be effective, this bill will help to stimulate consumer spending and accelerate needed business investment."
SNT.146566.18785	His convictions include assaulting his fourth wife in 2006, and he served four months despite requesting community service; a stab attack from behind with a five-inch blade on a friend landed him a two-year suspended sentence and put the man in hospital.
SNT.146566.18786	He also served thirteen months for stabbing a friend while drinking and has been prosecuted for attacking a man with a knife in a restaurant, a case dropped through lack of evidence.
SNT.125172.18787	According to a spokesman for NATO, an attempted hijacking of a Norwegian tanker in the Gulf of Aden by Somali pirates has been thwarted by NATO forces.
SNT.125172.18788	The MV Front Ardennes came under attack by pirates in a small skiff at about 6:00 PM on Saturday.
SNT.125172.18789	Helicopters and a warship were dispatched to rescue the vessel, and the pirates were apprehended seven hours after the initial hijacking.
SNT.125172.18790	Officials said that pirates tried to flee in the dark, but were caught by a Canadian vessel.
SNT.125172.18791	Seven of the pirate gunmen were temporarily detained, but were later released.
SNT.125172.18792	NATO spokesman Lieutenant Commander Alexandre Santos Fernandes stated that since there was no Canadian law that could have prosecuted the pirates, they had to be released.
SNT.125172.18793	Piracy is rife off the eastern coast of Africa; on Saturday, Somali pirates seized a Belgian ship, the Pompei, with its ten crew members, as it was headed south for the Seychelles islands.
SNT.125172.18794	Over sixty ships, in total have been hijacked by pirates since the start of last year.
SNT.125172.18795	Currently, pirates are thought to be holding about three hundred crew members from seventeen ships.
SNT.115540.18796	An on duty superintendent in the New South Wales Police Force was caught speeding in an unmarked police car at 176km/h in a 100km/h zone on the Olympic Highway near Junee, New South Wales on October 13.
SNT.115540.18797	Superintendent Frank Goodyer, who was caught by his own officers in the Wagga Wagga Local Area Command, was charged with driving at more than 45km/h over the speed limit, had his automatically license suspended for six months and fined A$1674.
SNT.115540.18798	It was reported by Sydney radio station 2GB that it was Superintendent Frank Goodyer as the officer who was caught speeding by his own officers after the New South Wales Police released a media release which did not name the officer who was caught.
SNT.115540.18799	Superintendent Frank Goodyer told ABC Radio, "I accepted the penalty."
SNT.115540.18800	"I accept that I've done the wrong thing and, as I say, it is still my job as a senior police officer to encourage safe driving and I will continue to do that regardless of my actions".
SNT.402946.18801	The European Commission (EC) has approved yesterday a takeover of loss-making UK airline bmi from Lufthansa by International Airlines Group (IAG), owner of British Airways (BA). 
SNT.402946.18802	IAG will have to make concessions after told the EC the deal would be anti-competitive.
SNT.402946.18803	The deal is set to cost IAG, who also own Iberia,£172.5 million.
SNT.402946.18804	That value could fall as budget subsidiary may be retained by Lufthansa or sold elsewhere, and IAG are reported to be primarily interested in the main bmi business.
SNT.402946.18805	IAG intends to use acquired slots at the busy , which serves London, to expand their own routes into Asia.
SNT.402946.18806	The EC required IAG to surrender a number of flight slots at the airport.
SNT.402946.18807	The slots surrendered or made available for lease are for use to destinations in Scotland, France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.
SNT.402946.18808	The EC also insisted that combined BA/bmi routing be made available for competitors to buy transfer seats upon.
SNT.402946.18809	Lufthansa intended to shut down bmi had the bid failed.
SNT.402946.18810	IAG boss called the sale "great news for Britain" with results that are "good for UK business and UK consumers."
SNT.402946.18811	Virgin boss had previously said the move would give BA excessive dominance on Scottish flights.
SNT.402946.18812	More Heathrow slots earmarked for Scotland have been given up than any other destination.
SNT.402946.18813	Ryanair took the opportunity to claim only their own takeover bid for Aer Lingus has been a major EC casualty.
SNT.402946.18814	"Today's rubber-stamping of BA's purchase of bmi shows yet again that the EC has one rule for Europe's flag-carriers, but different rules for Ryanair", said Ryanair chief .
SNT.3110.18815	Nine people have died in bush-fires in the region of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia.
SNT.3110.18816	The fire has spread over 40,000 hectares of scrub, bushland and farmland so far and is still burning out of control.
SNT.3110.18817	Hundreds of firemen have been fighting the fire, but conditions have been difficult because of strong winds and temperatures soaring well over 40 degrees Celsius.
SNT.3110.18818	Of the nine who have died, eight were attempting to escape the advancing fire in their cars.
SNT.3110.18819	Locals of some rural towns fled to the ocean to escape the fires.
SNT.3110.18820	Thousands of sheep and cattle have also been killed in the fires.
SNT.3110.18821	Separate fires have also been burning around Mount Osmond and Cleland National Park in the Adelaide hills.
SNT.3110.18822	Bush-fires are annual occurrences in Australia, but these fires have been the worst in terms of deaths since the Ash Wednesday fires that killed 28 people in South Australia.
SNT.3110.18823	Two years ago, over 400 houses were burnt down in a bush fire in the Australian capital city, Canberra.
SNT.39755.18824	Today, Nintendo revealed that the real name for the console previously known by the codename "Revolution", is Wii.
SNT.39755.18825	The name was revealed in a message posted on Nintendo of America's official site, which is shown below.
SNT.39755.18826	In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, the name received much criticism for sounding too much like "wee", an English slang word meaning urine.
SNT.39755.18827	The name also sounds similar to "yes" in French and "good" in Japanese.
SNT.60481.18828	Australian Prime Minister John Howard has attacked US presidential candidate Barack Obama on his pledge to introduce a bill that would withdraw American troops from Iraq by March 2008.
SNT.60481.18829	On Sunday, Prime Minister Howard said the move would hand victory to insurgents in Iraq.
SNT.60481.18830	"I think that would just encourage those who wanted completely to destabilise and destroy Iraq, and create chaos and victory for the terrorists to hang on and hope for (an) Obama victory," Mr Howard said.
SNT.60481.18831	"If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008, and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats."
SNT.60481.18832	Mr Obama dismissed Howard's comments as "empty rhetoric", unless he was to send another 20,000 Australians to fight in Iraq.
SNT.60481.18833	"So, if he's (inaudible) if to fight the good fight in Iraq, I would suggest that he calls up another 20,000 Australians and sends them to Iraq."
SNT.60481.18834	"I would also note that we have close to 140,000 troops on the ground now, and my understanding is that Mr Howard has deployed 1,400", said Mr Obama.
SNT.60481.18835	The Australian government said its contribution to the war in Iraq was appropriate given Australia's population and military size and that Obama's response failed to address the "substance of the issue".
SNT.60481.18836	Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said 20,000 troops would be "half of our army".
SNT.60481.18837	Mr Howard, considered a close ally of the United States government, has faced attacks and support from US politicians.
SNT.60481.18838	Democrat Terry McAuliffe said "Firstly, the Prime Minister has been a great friend of George Bush's."
SNT.60481.18839	"He has been with him lock-step from day one on this war in Iraq."
SNT.60481.18840	Republican presidential candidate Duncan Hunter said Howard had earned a right to comment about Obama's policy "I think the Aussies have earned a right to comment on the world stage about their partner in this endeavour, because they've been fighting side-by-side with us in Iraq," said Hunter.
SNT.60481.18841	"And so I think that John Howard, while it wasn't a very complimentary statement, he is basically stating the truth and that is that what we say on the Senate floor on or the House floor goes to a world audience."
SNT.60481.18842	"And it has an impact on not only our allies, but also our adversaries."
SNT.60481.18843	Roy Ryden, another US Democrat said Mr Howard's comment was "bizarre" and accused the Prime minister of interfering with US politics "The most charitable thing you can say ab"out Mr Howard's comment is bizarre.
SNT.60481.18844	"You know, we'll make our own judgements in this country with respect to elections and Barack Obama is a terrific public servant."
SNT.60481.18845	Mr Howard has drawn criticism from some conservative Republicans with John Cornyn saying Howard should stay out of US domestic politics.
SNT.60481.18846	The Australian Prime Minster further defended his statement today, claiming Obama's plan threatened Australia's national security.
SNT.60481.18847	"If the United States were to withdraw her combat units from Iraq by the early part of next year it could only be represented as a defeat for the United States in Iraq," he said.
SNT.60481.18848	"I hold the strongest possible view that it is contrary to the security interests of this country for America to be defeated in Iraq."
SNT.60481.18849	Australia's strong links to the United States and its support for the U.S.-led war on Iraq were key issues for Howard's fourth straight election win in late 2004.
SNT.60481.18850	The Australian opposition has used the comments as an opportunity to attack the government.
SNT.60481.18851	Opposition leader Kevin Rudd said Howard needed to avoid taking sides in American politics as it was important for the Australia-U.S. alliance that leaders could deal with each other despite their political affiliations.
SNT.602338.18852	An estimated over 100,000 people protested in Tahrir Square yesterday in opposition to a constitutional decree made by Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi.
SNT.602338.18853	Riot police dispersed the crowd with tear gas as clashes began.
SNT.602338.18854	The constitutional decree made November 22 by Morsi protected the constitution drafting body of Egypt from dissolution and also protected executive decisions from being overturned.
SNT.602338.18855	The decree has sparked protests and strikes reminiscent of protests which eventually toppled the then president Hosni Mubarak.
SNT.602338.18856	Earlier this year in September Egyptian courts ruled to dissolve Egypt's parliament.
SNT.602338.18857	Morsi opposed the ruling, threatening action, but later respected the decision.
SNT.602338.18858	Mohamed ElBaradei said Morsi is acting like a "new ".
SNT.602338.18859	ElBaradei has also said that because of the recent decree "a civil war threatens to erupt in Egypt."
SNT.602338.18860	Counter demonstration planned by the Muslim Brotherhood and Nour Party has been cancelled to avoid possible further violence.
SNT.60342.18861	Honey-bee decline has accelerated in North America beyond the steady attrition of the past 25 years according to scientists and farmers.
SNT.60342.18862	A relatively new term - "Colony Collapse Disorder" is being used to describe this poorly understood phenomenon.
SNT.60342.18863	Colony Collapse Disorder (or CCD) is a syndrome evidenced by massive die-off affecting an entire insect population.
SNT.60342.18864	The cause of the syndrome is not yet well understood.
SNT.60342.18865	CCD may be caused by mites or associated diseases or unknown pathogens.
SNT.60342.18866	CCD is possibly linked to pesticide use though several studies have found no common environmental factors between unrelated outbreaks studied.
SNT.60342.18867	According to Dennis vanEngelsdorp, a bee specialist with the Pennsylvania State Department of Agriculture, "We are pretty sure, but not certain, that it is a contagious disease."
SNT.60342.18868	Honey-bees are responsible for approximately one third of the United States crop pollination including such species as: peaches, soybeans, apples, pears, pumpkins, cucumbers, cherries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries.
SNT.60342.18869	From 1971 to 2006, approximately one half of the U.S. honey-bee colonies vanished.
SNT.60342.18870	The rate of attrition reached new proportions in the year 2006, which were alarming to many farmers and honey-bee scientists.
SNT.60342.18871	At least eleven different states as well as portions of Canada are known to have been affected by colony collapse disorder.
SNT.60342.18872	The disorder has been identified in a geographically diverse group of states including Georgia, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and California.
SNT.60342.18873	In some states the loss of honey-bee colonies is estimated as high as 75 percent of the population.
SNT.60342.18874	The phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey-bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value is $US 1.5 billion.
SNT.60342.18875	Total U.S. crops that are wholly dependent on the honey-bee are known to exceed $US 15 billion.
SNT.60342.18876	In a related development on January 17, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has drastically tightened use rules on some of the chief pesticides used on apples, blueberries, grapes, peaches, pears and other fruits pollenized by honey-bees.
SNT.60342.18877	Citing general environmental protection and farmworker safety, the EPA recently announced the tightening of use or phaseout of the highly toxic pesticides phosmet and Azinphos methyl.
SNT.60342.18878	Under these rule changes the use of these organophosphate pesticide would be allowed continued use for five years but have somewhat reduced dosage limits.
SNT.60342.18879	Azinphos methyl is a dangerous neurotoxin derived from nerve agents used during World War II.
SNT.190592.18880	South Korea has lost contact with its Naro-1 rocket, just 137 seconds after take-off.
SNT.190592.18881	Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) and Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center had hoped to use a Naro-1, South Korea's first carrier rocket, to launch a STSAT-2B satellite.
SNT.190592.18882	South Korea had postponed the launch on Wednesday due to problems with the rocket's fire extinguisher system.
SNT.190592.18883	Science Ministry spokesman Pyun Kyung-bum said, "We expect that it will be difficult to launch today".
SNT.190592.18884	The rocket lifted off from Goheung's Naro Space Centre at 1701 (0801 GMT) today.
SNT.190592.18885	The rocket apparently exploded 137 seconds after launch, when a flash was seen from an on-board camera and communication was lost.
SNT.190592.18886	The loss of communication occurred when the rocket had achieved an altitude of around 70 kilometers (43 mi).
SNT.190592.18887	Television cameras captured a white speck, presumably part of the rocket, falling into the sea.
SNT.190592.18888	Analysts say the failure is a setback for South Korea.
SNT.190592.18889	If it had been successful, it would have been the first Naro-1 launch to reach orbit.
SNT.190592.18890	The launch cost South Korea an estimated US$400 million, and if successful, would have launched a satellite called the STSAT-2B into orbit.
SNT.190592.18891	The satellite was designed to examine climate change and its effects.
SNT.190592.18892	The incident is seen as a major setback for South Korea's space program, which had been aiming to become the 10th country to achieve the capability to launch satellites, and the fourth Asian country, after China, Japan, and India.
SNT.190592.18893	A successful launch would have helped South Korea to become a player in commercial space launches, an industry valued at around US$250 billion.
SNT.190592.18894	Since 1992, South Korea has launched 11 satellites from overseas sites with foreign-made rockets.
SNT.57162.18895	A strong earthquake struck off the southern tip of Taiwan at 12:26 UTC, triggering a warning from Japan's Meteorological Agency that a 3.3 foot tsunami could be heading towards Basco, in the Philippines.
SNT.57162.18896	The head of the earthquake monitoring agency in the Philippines disputed the Japanese agency's warnings, however.
SNT.57162.18897	Conflicting reports have placed the magnitude of the quake between 6.7 and 7.2 on the Richter Scale, with the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau marking it at 6.7, the United States Geological Survey estimating it at 7.1, and the Japan Meteorological Agency putting the magnitude at 7.2.
SNT.57162.18898	Despite the Japanese Meteorological Agency's warning of a tsunami threat to the Philippines, Renato Solidum, the director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, denied that a tsunami is headed towards the Philippines, saying that the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii had not released any tsunami advisory.
SNT.57162.18899	Nevertheless, Solidum said that residents in low-lying areas in the Philippines should, as a precaution, move to higher ground.
SNT.57162.18900	In the aftermath of the quake, news agencies have aired reports of collapsed houses, hotel guests being trapped in elevators, and telephone outages due to severed lines across Taiwan.
SNT.57162.18901	The earthquake has damaged six submarine fiber-optic communications cables, restricting internet access to millions of users in Asia and Australia.
SNT.57162.18902	Home users are experiencing severe connection issues, with timeouts becoming very common.
SNT.57162.18903	The Internet Storm Center is reporting a 100% packet loss on certain routers.
SNT.57162.18904	A sample ping test from Singapore to Wikinews came up with a 380 millisecond average round trip at 50% packet loss.
SNT.57162.18905	The financial markets are facing an even more alarming situation, with financial news and stock quotes from the U.S. and Europe not being able to reach Asian markets.
SNT.57162.18906	Repairing the lines "is not a matter of days," says Hong Seoung-Yong, a ministry official from South Korea handling the problem.
SNT.57162.18907	Taiwan's internet capacity has dropped to 40%, and consequently the networks there are jammed.
SNT.57162.18908	Service providers may choose to bypass those lines in favour of European ones, say a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp, Satoru Ito.

SNT.5475.18911	Peruvians living near the site of a release of mercury are preparing to sue a U.S. mining company, announcing last Saturday that they will bring their case before a Denver judge.
SNT.5475.18912	On June 2, 2000, a serious accident in the province of Cajamarca, in Peru, poisoned many residents with mercury, a highly toxic heavy metal.
SNT.5475.18913	A truck from Newmont Mining Company dumped two metal canisters of mercury along an Andean highway, in the communities of San Juan, Choropampa, and Magdalena.
SNT.5475.18914	Curious townspeople (mostly children) picked up the silvery droplets, and some even drank some of it.
SNT.5475.18915	Some of those who came in contact with the mercury suffered blindness, and one even had a purplish rash on her body.
SNT.5475.18916	Over 300 people directly suffered the effects of mercury poisoning.
SNT.5475.18917	As the owners of the Yanacocha mine which produced the mercury, Newmont Mining offered up to US$6 thousand to more than 700 local residents, but over 1,100 others are still engaged in a legal battle with Newmont over the case.
SNT.5475.18918	In today's global economy, many international businesses have looked overseas to maintain their profits, but environmental law professor James Otto is asking about the cost to the environment and public health.
SNT.5475.18919	"Any company that wants to mine internationally now must not only have the legal right to mine but also a 'social license' to operate," he said.
SNT.5475.18920	As the Peruvian residents gear up for their lawsuit against Denver-based Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold mining firm, some of these important questions may finally be answered.
SNT.5475.18921	After the breakdown of mediation talks with Newmont on January 20, the residents and their lawyer decided to stop negotiating behind closed doors and take their case to the public.
SNT.5475.18922	Last Saturday, March 5, 2005, they announced that they are bringing their suit before Denver District Judge Robert Hyatt.
SNT.5475.18923	This is not the first time Newmont Mining has had trouble with an emerging Third World environmental movement.
SNT.5475.18924	Recently, in August 2004, a US$543 million lawsuit was filed against Newmont Mining by the Indonesian Environmental Ministry and local villagers.
SNT.5475.18925	They claim that pollution caused by the company’s mining activities has caused serious illnesses and other health problems, including skin disease, tumors, birth defects, and a decline in fish stocks, a staple food.
SNT.5475.18926	One particular mining practice used frequently by Newmont Mining in Indonesia is submarine tailings disposal, a waste disposal method for mercury and arsenic that is outlawed in the United States.
SNT.5475.18927	At least six Newmont Mining managers, including an American and an Australian, face up to 15 years in a Jakarta prison for environmental and corporate crime in that case.
SNT.5475.18928	The local Peruvian residents are continuing their fight for safer mining practices and compensation for existing damage and injuries.
SNT.5475.18929	Thousands of local townspeople protested against the Yanacocha mine last fall, demanding protection for the local water supply.
SNT.5475.18930	Newmont Mining officials have blamed the June 2000 mercury spill on a contractor, and have lost the battle to keep the case out of the American court system.
SNT.25892.18931	The Somalian government called on Saturday for the international community to help stem the wave of recent seafaring pirate attacks off their coast in the Indian Ocean.
SNT.25892.18932	The London-based International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reported yesterday that a Thai merchant vessel and its crew of 26 have been hijacked by Somalian pirates off their coastline.
SNT.25892.18933	The predominantly Thai crew were kidnapped at gunpoint, and a ransom has been demanded for their release.
SNT.25892.18934	The merchant ship was en-route from Brazil to Yemen with a cargo of sugar.
SNT.25892.18935	A letter to Somalia from the United Nations security council admonished the government.

SNT.195075.18940	The Obama Administration has denied Colombian journalist Hollman Morris entry into the United States, citing violation of the "terrorist activities" section of the USA's Patriot Act.
SNT.195075.18941	Morris was attempting to obtain a visa to attend Harvard University's Nieman Program, which is a fellowship for journalists.
SNT.195075.18942	The journalist has called attention to ties between outgoing Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, and right-wing militia groups in the war-plagued South American country.
SNT.195075.18943	Human rights activists have speculated that Uribe might have influenced the visa denial.
SNT.195075.18944	Morris' phone has also been tapped by the DAS, the Colombian state security agency, which is Colombia's CIA counterpart.
SNT.195075.18945	Though the exact reason for Morris' visa denial is unclear, when Morris went on-site to cover the release of four Colombian security force members' release by FARC rebels, Uribe called the journalist "an accomplice of terrorism".
SNT.80864.18946	At least 11 new species of life have been discovered in the rainforests of Thua Thien-Hue Province in Vietnam in a region of the forest described as the "Green Corridor."
SNT.80864.18947	The discovery was made by researchers from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
SNT.80864.18948	Among the new species are five orchids and at least three other species of plants, two butterflies and a snake.
SNT.80864.18949	At least ten more species of plants are believed to be new species but are still being studied.
SNT.80864.18950	"You only discover so many new species in very special places, and the Green Corridor is one of them."
SNT.80864.18951	"Several large mammal species were discovered in the 1990s in the same forests, which means that these latest discoveries could be just the tip of the iceberg," said a technical adviser in Vietnam for the WWF, Chris Dickinson.
SNT.80864.18952	The new species of life are exclusive to the rainforest in Thua Thien-Hue Province.
SNT.80864.18953	The new snake, which can grow to 80 centimeters long, has been given the name white-lipped keelback because of a yellow-white stripe on the top of its head and makes its home near small streams and feeds on small animals and frogs.
SNT.80864.18954	The new species of butterflies are one subfamily of the Satyrinae species and the other a species of the Skipper butterfly.
SNT.80864.18955	The orchids, all of which are considered very rare because they were found to have no leaves whatsoever on the plant, grow in "matter" that is rotting and also contain no chlorophyll.
SNT.80864.18956	The other two new plant species are of Arum and Aspidistra.
SNT.80864.18957	The WWF is concerned that civilization may move closer into the rainforest, destroying the homes of these new species, but the government of Thua Thien-Hue Province says it's dedicated to making sure that they are protected, along with the rainforest.
SNT.80864.18958	"The area is extremely important for conservation and the province wants to protect the forests and their environmental services, as well as contribute to sustainable development," said Provincial Forest Protection Department Director for the province, Hoang Ngoc Khanh.
SNT.80864.18959	The species were found in the rainforest in 2005 and 2006.
SNT.116382.18960	Hurricane Paloma, which the U.S. National Hurricane Center yesterday labeled as "extremely dangerous", has recently hit Cuba.
SNT.116382.18961	In preparation of this, at 1500 UTC yesterday, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Holguin were issued with a Hurricane warning by the country's government.
SNT.116382.18962	Due to updated forecasts, it has also removed the waning for the province of Sancti Spiritus.
SNT.116382.18963	220,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the Camaguey province, while 170,000 were evacuated from the province of Las Tunas.
SNT.116382.18964	The Hurricane is now weakening, however, with the NOAA stating that "continued weakening is expected over the next day or two, even after Paloma moves off the coast of Cuba."
SNT.116382.18965	The NOAA has also stated that "Paloma is expected to produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches over eastern Cuba."
SNT.116382.18966	"Rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are possible over the central Bahamas."
SNT.116382.18967	Hurricane Paloma was the seventeenth tropical depression of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season.
SNT.116382.18968	Paloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the northern coast of Honduras on November 5.
SNT.116382.18969	The depression then became a tropical storm then a hurricane.

SNT.111975.19057	Large herd animals may have the ability to detect earth's magnetic field, concluded scientists in Germany in a report published in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences after performing studies of cattle and deer grazing and sleeping patterns.
SNT.111975.19058	The animals tended to face north-south oriented toward the earth's magnetic poles.
SNT.111975.19059	Hynek Burda of the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany led the team that announced the unconfirmed study.
SNT.111975.19060	Burda and his team gathered cattle data via analysis of Google Earth images.
SNT.111975.19061	The team originally intended to test for possible human magnetic field detection by studying the orientation of sleeping bags in outdoor campers, but it proved difficult to obtain data because humans usually slept under tents.
SNT.111975.19062	Cattle were easier to observe, and 8,510 head of cattle at 308 locations demonstrated a strong tendency to align body orientation in accordance with the earth's magnetic field.
SNT.111975.19063	Other possible factors such as wind or sunlight direction did not supply a better explanation for the behavior.
SNT.111975.19064	To compare against a second large species, Burda and his team analyzed data on 2,974 deer studied through photography, direct observation, and snow imprints.
SNT.111975.19065	"I think the really amazing thing is that hunters and herdsmen and farmers didn't notice it," said Burda according to a National Public Radio report.
SNT.111975.19066	Peter August of the University of Rhode Island in Kingston, commented: "I was really amazed at the consistency with which they found north-facing cows and deer."
SNT.111975.19067	No independent study has yet confirmed the Duisburg-Essen team's findings.
SNT.111975.19068	This is the first study that indicates magnetic field detection in large mammals.
SNT.111975.19069	Burda's previous research involves naked mole rats, a small blind mammal species whose behavior indicates an internal magnetic compass.
SNT.111975.19070	According to a report by Jeremy Hsu at MSNBC, "Previous research has shown that animals such as birds, turtles and salmon migrate using a sense of magnetic direction, and small mammals such as rodents and one bat species also have a magnetic compass."

SNT.78504.19080	Two men have been charged with starting the Zaca Fire, the second-largest wildfire in the history of California.
SNT.78504.19081	The fire is continuing to burn through the Los Padres National Forest, and has consumed a total of 240,000 acres, having started on July 4.
SNT.78504.19082	However, the fire is now under control, and is expected to be contained by September 4.
SNT.78504.19083	Jose Jesus Cabrera of Santa Ynez, 38, Santiago Iniguez Cervantes of Santa Maria, 46, and the company of Rancho La Laguna, whom they worked for, have all been charged with six counts of felony in relation to starting the fire.
SNT.78504.19084	Three of the charges are for "recklessly causing a fire that caused great bodily injury".
SNT.78504.19085	Two counts of this stem from the crash of a helicopter that was fighting the fires, and the other from a separate incident when a third firefighter was seriously wounded while battling the flames.
SNT.78504.19086	The other three counts are for recklessly causing a structure or forest fire, carelessness with a flaming substance and for not having the required permit to operate equipment capable of starting a fire.
SNT.78504.19087	The fire started when equipment being used on a blocked water line sparked.
SNT.78504.19088	58 firefighters were injured in total by the blaze, although no life-threatening injuries were sustained.
SNT.78504.19089	Currently, 1,800 people are involved in firefighting efforts, which have cost a total of $114 million.
SNT.78504.19090	A lawyer for the men said he felt the charges were excessive considering the circumstances.
SNT.78504.19091	"We have a couple of hard working guys who go out to take care of a water pipe or some cattle on a very hot day on the Fourth of July and they took precautions and despite the precautions an accident happened and a fire started," said Attorney Robert Sanger.

SNT.14075.19108	He was not accompanied by any security at that time.
SNT.168976.19109	After a year of turbulent weather in Mexico and destruction of their habitat, the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) population could be down by as much as 50% to 60% this year, experts say.
SNT.168976.19110	A gathering area for the butterflies northwest of Mexico City was affected particularly hard by severe weather this winter, which killed 50 people in the region.
SNT.168976.19111	According to Lincoln Brower, a monarch expert with Sweet Briar College in Virginia, "things are in pretty bad shape."
SNT.168976.19112	The southbound migration was already the smallest in recorded history, and with the destructive winter, over half of the species' population might have been killed.
SNT.168976.19113	"This means the numbers going to Texas are going to be down", said Chip Taylor, a professor of entomology at the University of Kansas-Lawrence.
SNT.168976.19114	He believes it could take years for the Monarchs to repopulate.
SNT.168976.19115	Taylor also said that "We’re talking about significant degradation at overwintering sites; the loss of habitat in the United States and Canada and climate change in Mexico."
SNT.168976.19116	"We’ve had three major killing winter storms in the last decade that have never been seen previously."
SNT.168976.19117	"We’re dealing with something new here, and that’s consistent with climate change."
SNT.168976.19118	Illegal logging in Mexico and a lack of milkweed in the Midwest United States for the butterflies to lay their eggs in has also taken a toll on the Monarchs' population.
SNT.43916.19119	Research published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) suggests a link between male sexuality and conditions in the womb.
SNT.43916.19120	Initial research by Dr. Anthony F. Bogaert and his colleagues at Brock University, Ontario revealed a possible link between the number of elder brothers a boy has and the likelihood he is to be gay.
SNT.43916.19121	Whether this correlation be attributed to nature through the prenatal effects of the womb or to nurture through the psychosocial effects of growing up with elder siblings, however, remained unclear.
SNT.43916.19122	To further his research Bogaert studied 944 heterosexual and homosexual men.
SNT.43916.19123	The men were either "biological" brothers and shared the same mother or "non-biological" brothers through adoption or as half or step siblings.
SNT.43916.19124	Boegart reasoned that if the link between homosexuality and elder brothers was due to the nurturing effects of the family environment it would show regardless of any biological relationship.
SNT.43916.19125	The study showed, however, that the link was found only in biological brothers.
SNT.43916.19126	The amount of time an individual spent being raised with elder brothers had no bearing on sexual orientation; the relationship was even found to be true in brothers who were raised apart from one another.
SNT.43916.19127	Bogaert writes in this month's PNAS: "These results support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men and indicate that the fraternal birth-order effect is probably the result of a maternal 'memory' for male gestations or births."
SNT.43916.19128	He suggests that each male foetus prompts a progressively stronger immune reaction in the mother's body.
SNT.43916.19129	The antibodies that are produced by this reaction may account for sexual differentiation of the brain.
SNT.43916.19130	Scientists from Michigan State University added in an accompanying article: "These data strengthen the notion that the common denominator between biological brothers, the mother, provides a prenatal environment that fosters homosexuality in her younger sons."
SNT.43916.19131	"Increasingly, credible evidence appears to indicate that being gay is genetically determined rather than being a so-called lifestyle choice."
SNT.43916.19132	It adds further weight to the argument that lesbian and gay people should be treated equally in society and not discriminated against for something that's just as inherent as skin colour," said Andy Forrest, a spokesman for gay rights group Stonewall.
SNT.43916.19133	However; Dr. Bogaert's study made no explanation for the origin of lesbianism.
SNT.270358.19134	Only 44.47 percent of Romanian high school students passed last week's 2011 baccalaureate exam, according to the results published by Romanian education authorities on Sunday.
SNT.270358.19135	The baccalaureate exam in Romania is the secondary school educational qualification test, and passing it attests that a student has graduated high school and may be admitted to a university.
SNT.270358.19136	This is dramatically different from 69.3 percent last year and 81.4 percent in 2009.
SNT.270358.19137	Sunday's passing figures are a record low since the exam was introduced in Romania and comes after new anti-fraud measures cut back on student cheating.
SNT.270358.19138	These included installing cameras in examination centres and forbidding students from paying teachers to obtain higher scores.
SNT.270358.19139	For this exam, 665 high school students were caught cheating, double the number from last year, and at one high school it was found that the exam answers were given to 111 pupils prior to the exam.
SNT.270358.19140	Caras Severin County reported the lowest rate with 24.82 percent graduation, and Suceava reported the highest with 65.03 percent, down from 87.39 percent in 2010.
SNT.270358.19141	In Bucharest the rate was 42.03 percent, the lowest since the 1989 revolution.
SNT.270358.19142	The release of the results started a national debate on the possible causes of the drastic drop in scores, from the failure of parental participation, poor teacher pay and pay cuts, to student disinterest and lack of motivation.
SNT.270358.19143	Critics say the educational system depends on rote learning and students are not taught to think independently.
SNT.270358.19144	At a press conference on Monday, Education minister Daniel Funeriu said, "These results are a mirror of our society."
SNT.270358.19145	"Romania is now at a crossroads...".
SNT.270358.19145-1	"The nation should choose to encourage people who like to work rather than those who prefer cheating".
SNT.270358.19146	Cristian Alexandrescu, chief education inspector for Bucharest, argued that the exam was not taken seriously by students and the results prove that a student cannot obtain a diploma without effort.
SNT.270358.19147	"The moment of truth has come," Liliana Romanciuc, a school inspector in north-eastern Romania, told Mediafax.
SNT.40631.19148	SKY TV had problems earlier with some viewers unable to tune into certain channels.
SNT.40631.19149	It was caused by a streamlining issue not related to satellite problems.
SNT.40631.19150	The problem caused the following channels unable to be seen: Sky Movies, J2, Cartoon Network, Sky News, pay-per-view movie channels, radio channels including; National Radio, Concert FM and George FM.
SNT.40631.19151	Most of the free-to-air channels, however, were working, along with the sport channels, some channels did suffer from picture pixelation.
SNT.125188.19152	British author James Graham Ballard, known as J. G. Ballard has died at the age of 78.
SNT.125188.19153	Ballard died on Sunday after a long battle with prostate cancer.
SNT.125188.19154	According to a spokesperson, Ballard had been sick "for several years" and that it was "with great sadness" to have to make the announcement of his death.
SNT.125188.19155	Ballard is best known for writing the novels Crash in 1973 and Empire of the Sun in 1984 which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.
SNT.125188.19156	"He had grown up in Shanghai and had very good manners."
SNT.125188.19157	"He was very generous and polite and it took a long while before he would do anything that wasn’t very controlled," said friend and author Iain Sinclair to The Times.
SNT.125188.19158	Ballard was born in Shanghai, China in the Shanghai International Settlement in 1930.
SNT.125188.19159	When he was 12, he and his family were forced to live in a camp run by Japanese forces during World War II.
SNT.125188.19160	Ballard says that he won't say happy things about his experience in the camp, but also no unpleasant ones either.
SNT.125188.19161	In an interview with BBC News, Ballard said "I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on, but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time."
SNT.125188.19162	In 1946 he moved to the UK with his sister and mother where he began to write.
SNT.125188.19163	Twenty years later, in the 1960's, he employed himself as a full time writer.
SNT.125188.19164	He produced his first novel in 1961 titled The Wind from Nowhere and The Drowned World just a year later.

SNT.33886.19170	India won the final match of the recent cricket series.
SNT.33886.19171	Yuvraj Singh made a unbeaten 107 (93b, 15x4)helping India's , chasing 287, achieved with 19 deliveries remaining on a good batting pitch.
SNT.33886.19172	Mahendra Singh Dhoni (77 not out, 56b, 6x4, 4x6) was another important contributor to the Indian Innings.
SNT.33886.19173	The Pakistani bowling, apart from a probing spell from paceman Rao Iftekar Anjum, was made to look ordinary.
SNT.33886.19174	When on 64, Yuvraj was put down at covers by Shoaib Malik.
SNT.33886.19175	Tendulkar carried the drinks, indicating that in this Indian side experience and youth blended into one.
SNT.33886.19176	In Tendulkar's absence, Rahul Dravid opened the innings with Gautam Gambhir.
SNT.33886.19177	The left-handed Gambhir sparkled with a few pick-up shots on the leg-side; this also showed Pakistan's pacemen were not bowling the right line.
SNT.33886.19178	Mohammed Asif has not been a big factor in the ODIs since the away going delivery is a lesser weapon in this variety of the game, especially if a side is bowling in the afternoon.
SNT.33886.19179	It was his two-way movement that made him so dangerous in Tests.
SNT.33886.19180	Gambhir once again wasted a start, but the opening pair had, importantly, raised 69.
SNT.33886.19181	Dravid's 50 (6x4) might have consumed 82 deliveries, but he made sure that, in the absence of Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar, the Indians had enough wickets in hand before they began the final onslaught.
SNT.33886.19182	It was Sreesanth who dented Pakistan in the morning after Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar shared the new ball.
SNT.33886.19183	The Kerala paceman, who is learning fast, cut down on his pace realising that there was not too much assistance for him from the wicket.
SNT.33886.19184	He struck thrice and Pakistan, from 62 without loss, slumped to 77 for three.
SNT.33886.19185	In the context of the match, Sreesanth's spell of 5-1-25-3 was crucial.
SNT.33886.19186	Both Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal, after putting together 62, fell to pull shots, and Shoaib Malik steered right into Suresh Raina's hands at gully.
SNT.33886.19187	There is fluency about Sreesanth's run-up and action that is hard to ignore, and he did bowl well at the death, swinging the ball into the right-hander.
SNT.33886.19188	And off-spinner Ramesh Powar won a leg-before decision against an ominous looking Inzamam on the sweep; the delivery drifted into the right-hander from outside the off-stump and then straightened.
SNT.33886.19189	The bowlers, backed by aggressive fielding, had performed a fair job, under the conditions.

SNT.56689.19209	The Seattle Post-Intelligencer failed to print due to power failures at the printing facility, which had redundant power feeds from both the Seattle utility as well as PSE.
SNT.56689.19210	It is the first time in 70 years that the paper has not been printed.
SNT.56689.19211	The Seattle Times, a competing paper under a joint operating agreement, managed to print only 13,000 copies of its regular circulation of over 200,000.
SNT.56689.19212	The papers located alternate facilities to print a reduced version of their Saturday editions, and their joint Sunday issue was also expected to be reduced.

SNT.56689.19222	In those incidents no one was hurt, and there were a few spotty power outages.
SNT.56689.19223	This is the second serious storm to hit the Northwest since Thanksgiving, In late November, record-setting snowfall had a similar disabling effect on the region.
SNT.15551.19224	The British tabloid The Daily Mirror today suggested that the London bombers may not have planned to commit suicide, while a Scotland Yard spokesman said they have not definitely confirmed that the four men intended to die when they carried out the attacks.
SNT.15551.19225	The Daily Mirror claims that the bombers brought return rail tickets to Luton, and that they purchased pay and display car park tickets before boarding the train at Luton Station.
SNT.15551.19226	The tabloid paper also states how the bombers all had personal items on their person at the time of the attacks, such as wallets, driving licences and bank cards.
SNT.15551.19227	It also states how they were carrying large rucksacks which could be easily dumped, instead of having the explosives strapped to their bodies, as would be expected of a suicide bomber.
SNT.15551.19228	It also points to evidence from the bombers' families, where two of the men had pregnant wives.
SNT.15551.19229	From this evidence, the paper draws the conclusion that the four men were not told the bombs would detonate straight away, and that the men thought they would be able to escape unscathed.
SNT.15551.19230	This was probably done to protect their master's identity, the paper suggested, since there was a high probability the bombers would be caught had they lived.
SNT.183102.19231	A string of anti-government protests in Bangkok yesterday resulted in at least one fatality, numerous others injured, and the temporary closure of several foreign embassies in Thailand.
SNT.183102.19232	Philip Crowley, a spokesperson for the US State Department, announced early Thursday morning that the US embassy would be closed to the public due to its location near the violence.
SNT.183102.19233	The embassy will be operating with a reduced staff and will not offer American citizens services until the conflict is resolved.
SNT.183102.19234	The British and Dutch embassies in Thailand also halted their services after the Thai government said that it would seal off the area.
SNT.183102.19235	The leader of the protests was fugitive Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol, the radical leader of the militant Red Shirt movement.
SNT.183102.19236	While giving interviews with foreign journalists, Sawasdipol appeared to have been shot in the head by a sniper.
SNT.183102.19237	He was later taken to a local hospital for emergency treatment.
SNT.183102.19238	One other protester, 25-year-old Chartchai Bualao, was killed in the incident, but it is still unclear as to who is responsible for the shooting.
SNT.183102.19239	Thai military forces moved in quickly to suppress the protesters just after the shooting, aiming to put down the opposition movement and secure the area in which they had barricaded themselves since early April.
SNT.183102.19240	The Thai government declared a state of emergency for seventeen of the country's 76 provinces in the wake of the protests.
SNT.183102.19241	This incident is only the latest in an ongoing series of violent outbreaks among protesters and the Thai government.
SNT.183102.19242	The violence is a result of the belief of the protesters that Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva took power through illegitimate means with the support of the Thai military.
SNT.112041.19243	Following the escalation of investigations into St Stanislaus College in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia, Wikinews has obtained a police statement from an alleged victim made in 1997 against priest Brian Joseph Spillane.
SNT.112041.19244	It had been believed that Bathurst detectives set up Strike Force Header after receiving a complaint from a former St Stanislaus student last year.
SNT.112041.19245	The complainant came to the police's attention after he came to Bathurst handing out fliers documenting alleged abuses at the school and providing a link to a website he had set up.
SNT.112041.19246	St Stanislaus College contacted police and asked them to investigate.
SNT.112041.19247	Police contacted the alleged victim and asked him if he would like to make a complaint.
SNT.112041.19248	In the statement obtained by Wikinews, the same man complained to detectives at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia about abuse by Spillane at St Stanislaus.

SNT.144830.19256	The monarch did not immediately provide a reason for the move; however, there have recently been reports accusing the parliament of handling legislation ineptly, and even of being corrupt.
SNT.144830.19257	The king's decree ordered the civil service to host new elections to replace the 110-member parliament, although an exact date for the polls hasn't yet been named.
SNT.144830.19258	Critics of the parliament have said that its members didn't properly address issues such as unemployment and poverty.
SNT.144830.19259	The opposition, however, asserted that the house had been disbanded so that the government could use emergency laws to pass legislation.

SNT.36619.19261	At approximately 00:26 hrs, on Wednesday, March 22, the British Columbia ferry MV Queen of the North hit a rock near Gil Island in Wright Sound, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 75 from the start of ship's scheduled journey from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy on the Northern tip of Vancouver Island.
SNT.36619.19262	The ship missed a course change and ran agroung off Gil Island.
SNT.36619.19263	It took about an hour for the ferry to sink, giving passengers time to get out.
SNT.36619.19264	The vessel was carrying 101 passengers and crew, and all but 2 were accounted for.

SNT.9449.19270	Former Russian nuclear energy minister Yevgeny Adamov was arrested on Monday by Swiss authorities.
SNT.9449.19271	The arrest came at the request of U.S. officials who claim he stole more than nine million dollars allocated by Washington to help improve Russian nuclear safety.
SNT.9449.19272	The Ministry of Justice in Switzerland said Adamov will be extradited to the US.
SNT.9449.19273	The warrant allowing this states that he is charged with diverting money from the U.S. Department of Energy to several companies he controls.
SNT.9449.19274	Adamov's lead lawyer said he will fight the extradition warrant and called the accusations "baseless".
SNT.9449.19275	Adamov, who has on a number of occasions been investigated for his financial dealing by the U.S. and Russia alike, said he was being punished for his help in building a nuclear plant in Iran.
SNT.9449.19276	The U.S. now has 60 days to present a formal request, after which a Swiss court will make a ruling.
SNT.9449.19277	Swiss officials said it is common for this process to take several months.
SNT.9449.19278	Adamov's U.S. lawyer, Larry Breur, said Adamov admitted to depositing the money into a personal account, but then he used that account to dispense the money to Russian agencies and nuclear scientists.
SNT.9449.19279	Breur said the process was common in Russia to avoid hypertaxation.
SNT.9449.19280	Yevgeny Adamov was a minister in Boris Yeltsin's government, but was removed from power by Vladimir Putin in an effort to remove corruption.
SNT.9449.19281	Adamov was in Bern attempting to unblock bank accounts belonging to his daughter.
SNT.342882.19282	Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar registered yesterday as a candidate in the parliamentary by-election.
SNT.342882.19283	She is contesting, for her party the National League for Democracy (NLD), for Kawhmu, among the 48 seats in the election scheduled in April.
SNT.342882.19284	Suu Kyi is to contest in elections for the first time.
SNT.342882.19285	Her party won the 1990 election, but she was under house arrest.
SNT.342882.19286	The military junta did not accept NLD's majority in that election.
SNT.342882.19287	The NLD objected to electoral laws and boycotted 2010 elections.
SNT.342882.19288	Kawhmu is a rural township in south-west Myanmar which was hit by cyclone Nargis in 2008.
SNT.342882.19289	Suu Kyi's party would not have much power even if it won all the 48 available seats in the election.
SNT.342882.19290	Nevertheless, her participation could be a test for democratic reforms in Myanmar.
SNT.8323.19291	The National Anti-Hail Program was launched in 2000 and is due to be finalised in 2014.
SNT.8323.19292	It seeks to better protect those areas of the country that are most affected by hail.

SNT.73874.19299	Dutch adventurer Ralph Tuijn has reached the halfway point of his attempt to be the first person to row across the Pacific Ocean unaided.
SNT.73874.19300	The 16,000 kilometre journey from the coast of Peru to the seaside city of Brisbane, Australia, the widest section of the Pacific, has never been crossed absolutely unaided by a rower, and Tuijn says just nine people have rowed it even with assistance.
SNT.73874.19301	Tuijn reached the central point of his crossing, an insignificant point of water in the ocean, 111 days after setting off from Peru in March.
SNT.73874.19302	He has been making good progress, and has since cut his estimated time of arrival in Brisbane by a month.
SNT.73874.19303	The Dutchman, who now expects to reach his destination on October 20, has kept in touch with those tracking his movements through daily internet postings from his laptop computer, including his wife Winnie.
SNT.73874.19304	His boat, the Zeeman Challenger, is a seven-metre custom plywood vessel.
SNT.73874.19305	Tuijn has overcome a variety of obstacles to reach the halfway point.
SNT.73874.19306	He is suffering from the constant attention of sharks, who often bump his boat and disrupt his attempts at sleep.
SNT.73874.19307	One particular shark, dubbed 'Gomulka' by Tuijn, has been trailing the adventurer's boat for extended periods.
SNT.73874.19308	He has also accidentally burnt himself when he spilled hot water on his foot whilst trying to make coffee, apparently also from a shark 'bump'.
SNT.73874.19309	He is also forced to manually pump water for cooking and drinking after his automatic water pump broke down not long into his journey.
SNT.73874.19310	His vessel has no motors or sails, but relies on his physical rowing power to move.
SNT.73874.19311	The boat does have a solar power system to provide energy for his laptop, a telephone and a global positioning system.
SNT.73874.19312	Tujin, who is raising money for a children's home in Mumbai, India, is rowing at an average speed of 58 kilometres each day.
SNT.73874.19313	His diet consists of freeze-dried foods and fish, which are keeping him physically well-conditioned despite tiring mentally.
SNT.73874.19314	He has rowed across the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, as well as cycled across Russia and the icy terrain of Greenland.
SNT.111584.19315	Russian president Dmitry Medvedev followed the president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili and signed the ceasefire agreement on Saturday.
SNT.111584.19316	The peace plan document was originally drafted by Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France.
SNT.111584.19317	Medvedev announced during a meeting of the Russian Security Council that he had signed the document .
SNT.111584.19318	The truce was signed by Saakashvili on Friday, after a meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
SNT.111584.19319	Following the meeting, a press conference was held in which Saakashvili stated that he had signed the accord.
SNT.111584.19320	But he pointed out that "this is not a done deal."
SNT.111584.19321	"We need to do our utmost to deter such behaviour in the future."
SNT.111584.19322	By signing the agreement, both sides agree to pull back their forces to pre-conflict positions.
SNT.111584.19323	The accord allows certain concessions to both Georgia and Russia.
SNT.111584.19324	Initially Medvedev said that he had ordered Russian troops to begin leaving Georgia on August 11.
SNT.111584.19325	However, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov refused to put a timetable on the withdrawal of Russian forces from deep inside Georgia and stated that their departure depended on extra security measures being put in place.
SNT.111584.19326	Lavrov also said Russia would strengthen its contingent in South Ossetia.
SNT.111584.19327	In a letter to Saakashvili, Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed that according to the signed peace plan, Russian forces are obliged to withdraw from all major Georgian towns regardless of the "additional security measures" mentioned in the document.
SNT.111584.19328	According to Sarkozy, these additional measures refer to the border area only.
SNT.111584.19329	At the same time Georgian internal affairs ministry reported that Russian forces changed the administrative borders of Abkhazia, and captured one of the Georgian power plants in the area.
SNT.111584.19330	It is also reported that Russian forces destroyed the strategic Georgian rail bridge in Kaspi.
SNT.111584.19331	According to Lavrov, the document Saakashvili signed differed from the one signed by Medvedev, lacking its introductory part.

SNT.609824.19339	Two protesters in the United States who are associated with the 'Tar Sands Blockade' were arrested Monday after they barricaded themselves inside a portion of the Keystone Oil Pipeline under construction in Winona, Texas.
SNT.609824.19340	TransCanada, which owns the pipeline, stopped construction once the protest began.
SNT.609824.19341	"TransCanada Corporation didn't bother to ask the people of this neighborhood if they wanted to have millions of gallons of poisonous tar sands pumped through their backyards," said one of the protesters inside the pipeline, Matt Almonte in a statement posted to the group's website.
SNT.609824.19342	"This multinational corporation has bullied landowners and expropriated homes to fatten its bottom line", added Almonte.
SNT.609824.19343	Glen Collins, the second protester said, "I'm barricading this pipe with Tar Sands Blockade today to say loud and clear to the extraction industry that our communities and the resources we depend on for survival are not collateral damage."
SNT.609824.19344	According to their website www.tarsandsblockade.org, Almonte and Collins entered the pipeline prior to about 7:30 a.m. local time.
SNT.609824.19345	They went 25 feet into the pipeline and took with them two barrels filled with cement, weighing 600 pounds each and locked themselves in between them.
SNT.609824.19346	At around noon, police on scene entered the section of pipe, only to emerge a few minutes later without the protesters.
SNT.609824.19347	At 12:30, after an ambulance arrived on scene, police once again entered the pipe and began to pull on one of the barrels.
SNT.609824.19348	They were successfully removed and both Almonte and Collins were arrested.
SNT.609824.19349	A short time later a third protester, identified as Isabel Indigo Brooks, was also arrested.
SNT.609824.19350	In a statement to Wikinews, spokesperson for TransCanada Grady Semmens called the incident "unfortunate" saying, "This project is about supplying Canadian and American oil to U.S. refineries, pushing out more expensive crude oil from foreign regimes that do not support American values of freedom and common sense — Libya, Venezuela and the Middle East."
SNT.609824.19351	"It is unfortunate these protestors are trying to keep thousands of Americans from the jobs they depend on to provide for their families."
SNT.609824.19352	"This project is important not only to thousands of workers but also to Americans in general," added Semmens.
SNT.609824.19353	Construction on portions of the pipeline were halted in January when the White House denied permits for it to be finished.
SNT.609824.19354	"This announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline, but the arbitrary nature of a deadline that prevented the State Department from gathering the information necessary to approve the project and protect the American people," said President Barack Obama in January.
SNT.609824.19355	The portion of the pipeline affected by the protesters is part of the 'Gulf Coast Pipeline Project' that is to be about 485 miles long and consist of a "36-inch crude oil pipeline beginning in Cushing, Oklahoma and extending south to Nederland, Texas", says TransCanada on their website.
SNT.80508.19356	British architect Norman Foster and FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta presented today in Barcelona the redevelopment project for the team's stadium, Camp Nou, built in 1957.
SNT.80508.19357	The Catalan club expects that this redesign will turn the stadium into a city landmark and that "the external image of the stadium will become a recognized brand for FCB."
SNT.80508.19358	The new stadium will be wrapped in a colourful mosaic made up of the team's colours (blue and red) and those of the Catalan flag (red and yellow) and reminiscent of Gaudi's style.
SNT.80508.19359	This reptile-like cover of tiles and lights will allow the stadium to transform itself according to the time of day and the events taking place.
SNT.80508.19360	The project also includes the building of a retractable roof.
SNT.80508.19361	According to the Club, "the remodelled stadium is designed such that it can be built with minimal disruption to FCB normal football activity."
SNT.231819.19362	The United States' first major blizzard of the winter season has left much of the New England region covered in snow.
SNT.231819.19363	Stretching from Virginia to Maine, the storm, packing winds of over 50 miles per hour (80.5 kilometres per hour), dropped more than two feet of snow in some areas.
SNT.231819.19364	Residents prepared for what would be one of the worst nor'easters in quite some time.
SNT.231819.19365	The storm contained similar conditions to a category 2 hurricane.
SNT.231819.19366	Wellfleet, Massachusetts saw an 80 miles per hour wind gust, the strongest recorded throughout the storm.
SNT.231819.19367	Connecticut, New York and Maine all recorded wind gusts of over 60 miles per hour and gusts of over 70 miles per hour blasted Cape Cod.
SNT.231819.19368	A total of 32 inches (81.3 centimetres) fell in Rahway, part of the hardest-hit state in the storm's path.
SNT.231819.19369	Most New Jersey cities received over a foot of snow, while Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, and Maryland all had snow totals topping out at around 1 foot (30.48 centimetres) with Massachusetts topping out at a foot and a half.
SNT.231819.19370	On Monday, travel proved difficult, with flights from Philadelphia, Newark, New York City, Hartford, Boston, Portland, and Washington, D.C. canceled.
SNT.231819.19371	Drivers also ran into problems on major highways as accidents were unavoidable on the slick roads.
SNT.24868.19372	Japanese media reported that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi suggested yesterday that the government would submit a draft to the Diet to rewrite the Imperial Household Act within the next year.
SNT.24868.19373	This is in response to a board of experts who have been investigating the succession issue.
SNT.24868.19374	The experts' Board on the Imperial Household Act, personally appointed by the Prime Minister, reached an agreement on the issue that an Empress should be accepted.
SNT.24868.19375	Implementation of their recommendations would mean that succession to the highest position in Japanese society would occur without a gender bias.
SNT.24868.19376	At the present time, the Japanese imperial household has no male member under the age of 20; present law only allows male descendants to ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
SNT.24868.19377	The proposed solution would put Princess Aiko, the sole child of Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako in place as the most likely to inherit the position of monarch, following behind would be Princess Sayako who will leave the Imperial Household due to her planned marriage with a commoner.
SNT.24868.19378	Present law in Japan defines the succession as favouring male children; the last time the country had an Empress was in 1771, when Empress Go-Sakuramachi abdicated to her nephew.
SNT.24868.19379	Despite the fact that there is precedent for an Empress, some scholars have suggested family members who previously broke ties with the recognised royal family following the end of World War II should be considered for the succession, opening up the field of candidates even more.
SNT.24868.19380	The group of scholars proposing this solution have stressed that their solution is aimed at maintaining the tradition of a male heir.
SNT.249966.19381	Amongst the aftermath of a magnitude 8.9 earthquake which struck on Friday, followed by a tsunami, Naoto Kan, the prime minister of Japan, claimed that the country is experiencing its largest difficulties since the end of World War II in 1945.
SNT.249966.19382	Kan reported that there were limited supplies of electricity due to the closure of numerous power stations, including a nuclear power plant located in Fukushima Prefecture.
SNT.249966.19383	According to NHK, a broadcasting organization in Japan, approximately 310,000 individuals have been transported to safety in shelters that, in various cases, do not contain electricity.
SNT.249966.19384	The Government of Japan has reported the deaths of one thousand individuals, although thousands of others have not been taken into account.
SNT.249966.19385	The police have claimed that the death toll in the Miyagi Prefecture as a result of the earthquake and tsunami could be in excess of ten thousand.
SNT.249966.19386	100,000 troops - which equates to approximately 40% of the country's armed forces - are said to have been committed to assisting with the survivors of the disasters.
SNT.249966.19387	The nuclear agency of Japan consider the circumstances at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant to be Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which is an accident with local consequences.
SNT.249966.19388	According to BBC News Online, incidents like this usually cause one person to die from causes related to radiation.
SNT.249966.19389	No individuals from the power plant are reported to have died.

SNT.53450.19391	"I think we're all proud of what we've accomplished so far."
SNT.53450.19392	"But at the end of the day, it's not what we're aiming for down the road," said Daniel Briere, the co-captain for the Sabres.
SNT.53450.19393	"We want to be having these kinds of streaks in the playoffs."
SNT.53450.19394	"I think it will serve us well in the future, but right now we just need the points," said Ryan Miller, one of the Sabres goalies.
SNT.53450.19395	Currently Buffalo is 10-0-0 and is currently the top team in the NHL.
SNT.53450.19396	They will play the Atlanta Thrashers, who trail the Sabres by only 3 points in the NHL overall, on Saturday October 28.
SNT.53450.19397	Beginning at the end of last season, the Sabres have won 15 games in a row.
SNT.50113.19398	The U.S. House of Representatives approved the building of 700 miles of double-layered fence between the U.S. and Mexico this afternoon, it was the second time in a year that the issue was before the congress and the bill passed by a 238–138 vote.
SNT.50113.19399	The 2000 mile long border currently has 75 miles of fencing.
SNT.50113.19400	The bill also orders the U.S. Homeland Security Department to take over control of the border in 18 months and grants border agents new authority to stop fleeing vehicles.
SNT.50113.19401	It also ordered the Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to conduct a study of the necessity and feasibility of the construction of a "state-of-the-art barrier system" along the Canadian border.
SNT.127025.19402	Oil prices attained a six-month high on Friday, on new signs that the U.S. economy may not be contracting as fast as was believed.
SNT.127025.19403	U.S. crude oil prices reached US$66.47 a barrel, a level not seen since last November.
SNT.127025.19404	Brent North Sea crude oil was up $1.13 to $65.52 at the end of the week, after peaking at $65.70, also the highest level since November.
SNT.127025.19405	This comes soon after a report released by the U.S. Commerce Department showed that the U.S. GDP fell by 5.7%, revised from the original figure of 6.1%.
SNT.127025.19406	Analysts predict that oil prices will continue to rise amid more positive economic news, especially from economic giants such as India and Japan.
SNT.127025.19407	"Oil market participants' conclusion that the worst of the recession has passed and that a recovery in demand must be at hand was bolstered overnight by higher than expected first quarter growth in India and a sharp jump in Japan's April industrial production," said MF Globa's John Kilduff.
SNT.127025.19408	"We've got a lot more optimism about the economic outlook than we did."
SNT.127025.19409	"The market is factoring in a recovery in demand by the end of the year," said an analyst for the Commodity Warrants Australia, Toby Hassall.
SNT.78583.19410	The Sunday Times cites unnamed U.K. government sources saying that Britain's troops could leave Basra as early as October.
SNT.78583.19411	This alleged scenario would allow Gordon Brown to announce a troop withdrawal in a statement at the time MPs return to Parliament.
SNT.78583.19412	The speculations have sparked criticism from U.S. military commentators this weekend.
SNT.78583.19413	General Jack Keane said the withdrawal had "much more to do with conditions in the U.K." than with the situation in Iraq.
SNT.78583.19414	Frederick Kagan, of the American Enterprise Institute, said the expected withdrawal "highlights the growing divergence between the British and American approach."
SNT.78583.19415	Just yesterday, former General Sir Mike Jackson called Donald Rumsfeld's approach to the U.S. presence in Iraq "intellectually bankrupt".
SNT.78583.19416	An official statement from the British Ministry of Defence said that decisions about the number of troops in the Southern Iraqi province would take into account the position of the Iraqi and U.S. government.
SNT.78583.19417	The Ministry said that even after "a competent Iraqi security force" will have replaced them, some troops could still remain in Basra.
SNT.78583.19418	Until now, Gordon Brown has consistently refused to set a time table for a pull-back.
SNT.6754.19419	The upper house of the former Kyrgyz parliament declared it was terminating its work "to stabilize the situation and do away with conflicts" on Tuesday, as the lower house had done a day before.
SNT.6754.19420	The decision was signed by 32 of the 45 deputies.
SNT.6754.19421	"We think we have fulfilled our task, as far as was possible, especially in this time of trials," they said.
SNT.6754.19422	"A huge part of the state system was devoted to the election process."
SNT.6754.19423	"That is not a secret…"
SNT.6754.19423-1	"We have all seen what happens when the executive branch gets involved in elections."
SNT.6754.19424	"I think we will not get into that now …"
SNT.6754.19425	"I think that staff should get back to work," he said.
SNT.6754.19426	"Whoever is ... on my staff, if I hear that they got promoted for money or because they are someone's relative, or they belong to particular clan, then this person will be removed immediately," he added.
SNT.6754.19427	"We will set up public hotline so that people can complain against corruption," he told them.

SNT.783075.19436	In the lead-up to the federal election on September 7, both leaders were focused on refugee policy with Abbott attacking Rudd for failing to effectively protect the country's borders by disbanding border protection agreements implemented by the previous Liberal government.
SNT.783075.19437	"It's because Mr. Rudd closed it all down that we've had more than 50,000 illegal arrivals," claimed Abbott.
SNT.783075.19438	"There has been more than 800 boats, 11 billion dollars in budget blow-outs and tragically, more than 1000 deaths at sea."
SNT.783075.19439	Rudd claimed that the policy he'd put forward has "one simple principle" behind it: "If you are a people smuggler bringing someone to Australia and you are seeking to settle them in Australia, we will not allow it."
SNT.783075.19440	"They will be sent for processing in Papua New Guinea."
SNT.783075.19441	Rudd also used the debate to take a firm stance on same-sex marriage.
SNT.783075.19442	Pledging that a bill to legalise same-sex marriage would be introduced within 100 days of government, Rudd promised to allow a "full conscience vote" if he were to be re-elected.
SNT.783075.19443	Rudd called on the opposition to do the same, describing it as a "mark of decency" and stating that "folk out there want this to happen."
SNT.783075.19444	Abbott, however, agreed that while same-sex marriage was an "important issue", the economy was a more significant issue.
SNT.29015.19445	The Nine Network has announced the death of one of Australia's richest men, Kerry Packer, aged 68.
SNT.29015.19446	Announcer Richard Wilkins said on the Today Show that he had just been handed official confirmation of Mr Packer's death at 68.
SNT.29015.19447	He said a statement from Tony Ritchie, Nine head of news, said: "Mrs Kerry Packer and her children James and Gretel sadly report the passing last evening of her husband and their father Kerry."
SNT.29015.19448	"He died peacefully at home with his family at his bedside".
SNT.29015.19449	Packer was the major shareholder in Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) which owns the Nine television network and Australian Consolidated Press, the producer of many Australian and New Zealand magazines.
SNT.29015.19450	Packer was also involved in the gambling and tourism industries and owned the Crown Casino in Melbourne.
SNT.29015.19451	In the 1970s, his World Series Cricket revolutionised cricket, bringing One-day cricket to the fore by introducing things such as coloured uniforms, white balls & day/night matches.
SNT.29015.19452	Business Review Weekly magazine estimated Packer's net worth at AU$6.5 billion in 2004.
SNT.29015.19453	Another famous rich Australian media magnate, who may have lost his Australian nationality, is Rupert Murdoch.
SNT.62743.19454	Vornado Realty Trust of Paramus NJ has completed a deal to take a majority interest in the 1.8 million sq ft building at 555 California St in San Francisco, (aka The Bank of America Center) and the 2 million sq. foot building located at 1290 Avenue of The Americas in New York City.
SNT.62743.19455	In an announced deal worth $1.8 billion, the new investors get a 70 percent interest in both towers, alleviating the current owners, Hudson Waterfront Associates of any possible liability in a lawsuit brought against them by Donald Trump.
SNT.62743.19456	Built in 1969, 555 California is SF's largest office tower, and 2nd tallest building at 779 ft. just a few feet shy of the 48 story Transamerica Pyramid at 853 ft which was completed in 1972.
SNT.62743.19457	The SF structure, whose current deal estimates it's value @ $575 per sq ft, had just sold last year for $1.05 Billion all by itself ($583 a sq ft), when property magnate Walter Shorenstein sold it to Henry Cheng and Vincent Lo's Hong Kong based Hudson Waterfront Associates, a record for a city property.
SNT.62743.19458	Before 2005, 555 California had been Bank of America's World HQ, but that status ended when North Carolina based NationsBank ate up A.P Giannini's west coast banking legacy and kept the B of A name, but made the main HQ in Charlotte NC.
SNT.62743.19459	For lookee loos the 52nd floor of 555 California features the popular Carnelian Room, a hang for well to do bankers, brokers, lawyers and tourists checking out wide sweeping views from what was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi, now only the 5th Tallest Bldg on the west coast, but still impressive.
SNT.62743.19460	For those afraid of heights and the tab for "fine dining", the ground floor also features a Starbucks.

SNT.60031.19462	The woman was holding the bomb when it exploded and suffered injuries to her stomach and hands.
SNT.60031.19463	"We were called at around 9.40 this morning to reports of a suspect package at a business address in Victoria Street," said a spokesperson for Scotland Yard.
SNT.60031.19464	Victoria Street has been shutdown from Westminster Abbey to Scotland Yard while rescuers and police investigate the incident.
SNT.60031.19465	"As a precaution, a cordon has been put in place around the scene," said another police spokesperson.
SNT.60031.19466	The bomb was inside a "jiffy bag" which held the letter which was contained inside a padded envelope.
SNT.60031.19467	The woman who was injured was not believed to be the target.
SNT.60031.19468	Police will not say to whom the letter was addressed.
SNT.60031.19469	There are no reports of other injuries or deaths so far.
SNT.60031.19470	"We are not in a position to discuss who may or may not be responsible at this stage," said police.

SNT.41953.19472	The period of emergency rule, which would last 30 days, was imposed to "prevent violence and avoid further fatalities" and lead to "rapid reestablishment of public order."
SNT.41953.19473	At least 27 people have been killed, criminal documents reported stolen, and looting widespread in the East Timorese capital, Dili during the present period of unrest.

SNT.41953.19475	Mr Alkatiri was unable to stop the rioting that followed the government's decision in March to lay-off 600 soldiers when they refused to work, complaining of discrimination.
SNT.41953.19476	As the disorder grew during April and May, East Timor appealed for international assistance.
SNT.41953.19477	Justice Minister Domingos Sarmento said that Portugal had offered to provide East Timor with 120 security personnel by the weekend.
SNT.132042.19478	A cleanup effort is underway after torrential downpours on Friday, September 4 caused significant flooding in the north-east of Scotland.
SNT.132042.19479	The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said that the weather forecast in the coming days was improving, with no large amounts of rainfall predicted.
SNT.132042.19480	Over 500 homes had to be evacuated in Moray after the River Spey and River Lossie started to overflow their banks.
SNT.132042.19481	400 homes were also evacuated in the Elgin area and 50 more in Fochabers.

SNT.132042.19483	The Grampian Police and Tayside Police advised residents not to drive unless absolutely necessary.
SNT.132042.19484	In some places, a month's worth of rain had fallen in just 24 hours.
SNT.132042.19485	About 67 millimetres of rain had fallen in Aberdeen - roughly the equivalent of an average month of rainfall.
SNT.132042.19486	In Lossiemouth, the rainfall was 76.4 millimetres - 15mm more than the average amount every month.
SNT.132042.19487	As cleanup efforts progressed, Chief executive of Moray Council Alistair Keddie said, "Everything possible was done to protect residents."
SNT.132042.19488	However, some residents of the local areas are not so certain.
SNT.132042.19489	Mary Campbell, 62 from Fochabers said to the Times Online that she was "calling [for help] from 8pm but no-one showed up until about midnight."
SNT.132042.19490	"All the time the river kept going up and up."
SNT.132042.19491	"They came with sandbags, but by then it was too late."
SNT.132042.19492	The MSP for Moray Angus Robertson MP stated, "Water levels are higher than I have ever seen them before and communities have rallied to support people whose homes and businesses have been flooded."
SNT.132042.19493	"The objective must now be for everyone to help the victims of the worst flooding to hit Moray for many years to assist them rebuild their lives and get back to normality as quickly as possible."
SNT.132042.19494	"The hard lessons learnt from this latest devastation include the need for local agencies to redouble their efforts to get flood prevention measures into place and to recognise that climate change will only lead to more flooding in the future."
SNT.9769.19495	The New Zealand Government has been forced to act because of a letter sent to Prime Minister Helen Clark which claimed that the disease Foot and Mouth is being intentionally spread on Waiheke Island.
SNT.9769.19496	The letter, which is assumed to be a hoax, could have a major impact on New Zealand's meat industry.
SNT.9769.19497	Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton went so far as to say that the suspension of meat exports by some countries was a real possibility.
SNT.9769.19498	The incubation period of foot and mouth disease is such that if animals have been infected, signs should be evident within ten days.
SNT.9769.19499	In the meantime, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry experts and veterinarians, many with experience gained in the recent United Kingdom outbreak, are conducting intensive monitoring of the Island's susceptible animals.
SNT.9769.19500	All sheep and cattle are being individually inspected every 48 hours.
SNT.9769.19501	Meanwhile, restrictions on the movement of livestock are in place, so that in the very unlikely event that there has been a release of the disease, the effects will be contained.
SNT.9769.19502	Police efforts are underway to track the origin of the letter that initiated the scare.
SNT.132219.19503	The Mexican government has said that an Aeroméxico Boeing-737, flight 576 from Cancun, was hijacked and landed safely at Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City.
SNT.132219.19504	The situation ended without incident and all passengers and crew on board the aircraft were able to leave safely.
SNT.132219.19505	All hijackers were arrested after Mexican security forces boarded the plane.
SNT.132219.19506	The incident began just after 1:30 p.m. (CDT) one man took control of the plane and demanded to speak to Felipe Calderon, Mexico's president.
SNT.132219.19507	The hijacker said that if his demand was not met, he would blow up the plane.
SNT.132219.19508	Earlier reports had stated there were explosives on board the aircraft, but none were found.
SNT.132219.19509	A short time later, four of the detained men were released without being charged.
SNT.132219.19510	Authorities identified the sole hijacker as Jose Mar Flores, 44, who is being described as an alcoholic, drug addicted, religious fanatic.
SNT.132219.19511	He claims he was on a mission to warn Mexico that an earthquake was going to strike the country.
SNT.132219.19512	Flores said that the significance of the date, 9/9/09, the reverse of 666, was the reason why he hijacked the plane.
SNT.132219.19513	Reports say he was carrying a box that he described as a bomb and would detonate it if his demand to speak to Calderon about the quake was not met.
SNT.132219.19514	104 people were on board the plane, but all passengers and crew aboard the aircraft have left it safely.
SNT.132219.19515	The airport remained open while the plane was dealt with on an emergency runway.
SNT.132219.19516	Calderon was inside the airport's presidential hangar waiting to depart when the plane landed.
SNT.5327.19517	Margaret Wilson was appointed as Speaker of The House of Representatives.
SNT.5327.19518	She becomes New Zealand's first female Speaker of the House.
SNT.5327.19519	She also rounds out the top positions within New Zealand being taken by women.
SNT.5327.19520	All four of Governor-General, Prime Minister, Chief Justice and the Speaker of the House are female.
SNT.5327.19521	Clem Simich (National MP) received 37 and ACT MP Ken Shirley got five votes.
SNT.5327.19522	The position has usually been appointed unopposed, but the other two candidates stood to protest at the lack of consultation by Prime Minister Helen Clark.
SNT.5327.19523	Wilson takes over from Jonathan Hunt, who leaves to become the High Commissioner for New Zealand in London.
SNT.5327.19524	Hunt will remain in the backbenches until early next month.

SNT.103606.19532	The awards have been nationally televised within Canada since 1975.
SNT.103606.19533	Next year's ceremonies will be hosted in Vancouver, British Columbia.
SNT.143768.19534	Families of Spanish sailors being held for over a month appealed to Spain's government on Friday to negotiate with the Somali pirates for their release.
SNT.143768.19535	The kidnappers have threatened to kill three of the tuna trawler's crew after a stand-off with Spanish forces.
SNT.143768.19536	They called upon the government to free two captured Somalis held in Spain, who are suspected of being involved in the seizure of the Alakrana and its crew of 36.
SNT.143768.19537	As in the case with the Lynn Rival, a British yacht, the kidnappers have demanded their release.
SNT.143768.19538	Ricardo Blach, the captain of the trawler who is being held by the pirates, warned relatives by phone that they intended to kill the three crew members—moved from the trawler on Thursday and returned on Friday in a bid to pressure the Spanish government—should their demands not be met.
SNT.143768.19539	"They have just told us that if in three days there is no change over the two held in Spain, they will kill the three and then three others and then more," he said.
SNT.143768.19540	The Spanish government has ruled this out, but is willing to hand them over to an African country, such as Kenya, as happened in May.
SNT.143768.19541	"That is an issue for the courts to decide," commented Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega Sanz to reporters, adding that talking about this "technical topic which is legally very complicated" was "risky".
SNT.143768.19542	Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos stressed the need for calm amongst the tension of the removal and return of the three hostages.
SNT.143768.19543	"What does this mean?"
SNT.143768.19543-1	" It means we must remain calm."
SNT.143768.19544	"Kidnappings are complicated situations, with highs and lows, they are very difficult and stressful."
SNT.143768.19545	"But we must remain confident and calm," he said during a news conference.
SNT.143768.19546	"If we remain calm and confident I am certain that what all Spaniards want, what the families want, what the government wants—that the hostages can return to their homes safe and sound and this kidnapping ends satisfactorily."
SNT.143768.19547	Families say the captured crew have "little drinking water or food,".
SNT.143768.19548	They called for Spanish authorities to "act immediately" and "do everything possible to bring home the 36 fishermen."
SNT.143768.19549	"We demand that all the parties work in the same direction" and requested that the Spanish government chooses "negotiation" as opposed to risking the life of the crew in danger by forceful means.
SNT.143768.19550	The pirates captured the boat on October 2, and are demanding US$4 (€2.6) million in ransom in addition to the release of the two captured Somalis.
SNT.143768.19551	The crew comprises sixteen Spaniards, the crew includes eight Indonesians and members from Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Senegal and the Seychelles.
SNT.143768.19552	Spanish military captured the two suspected pirates when they left the trawler via a small boat.
SNT.143768.19553	On Friday, Spain's secretary of state for defence, Constantino Mendez, insisted that their release "is not negotiable."
SNT.143768.19554	He announced on Spanish National Radio that the hostages are "in good health" and that the kidnappers are "dramatising" the situation as a "negotiating tactic."
SNT.143768.19555	Two Spanish frigates are observing the situation off the Somali coast.
SNT.8658.19556	Queensland Australia's Sir Joh Bjelke Petersen, a controversial figure who served as the State's Premier for 19 years and reigned over the government that later became the subject of the Fitzgerald Inquiry, has died in hospital at Kingaroy, aged 94.
SNT.8658.19557	"By any measurement, Sir Joh was an exceptional state builder who will be remembered for consistently placing Queensland first," said the Australian Governor General, Major General Jeffery, in a statement.
SNT.8658.19558	Australian Prime Minister, John Howard: "He was certainly a strong political figure and I extend my condolences to his wife and his family."
SNT.8658.19559	But not all voices were sympathetic, prominent Queensland Aboriginal activist Sam Watson for example: "Aboriginal people will always remember him as a racist, a thug and a dictator."
SNT.8658.19560	Having suffered severe ill-health for some weeks, and declining health for years, Sir Joh passed away at around 6pm AEST.
SNT.8658.19561	He was surrounded by his family, who had been summoned yesterday by Lady Flo, his wife and one-time Senator, for final goodbyes.
SNT.8658.19562	Phrases such as "Don't you worry about that" and "Goodness gracious me" were like trademarks to the maverick leader.
SNT.8658.19563	Known simply as 'Joh' to many, he would famously describe press conferences as 'feeding the chooks'.
SNT.8658.19564	Today Kingaroy locals taunted waiting press with cries from "You're chooks, you're chooks, ha ha" to "Go home, ya vultures", and some obscenities, reported the Courier-Mail of Brisbane.
SNT.8658.19565	His fall from power at the end of the 80s was surrounded in controversy, with the state embroiled in corruption findings going to the level of his deputies, and Bjelke Petersen's claims of ignorance coming under challenge with charges of perjury.
SNT.8658.19566	The case was never heard due to a controversial hung jury: the foreman of the jury, Luke Shaw, had been an office-bearer of the Young Nationals — an arm of Bjelke Petersen's National Party — as well as a member of a group calling themselves 'Friends of Joh'.
SNT.8658.19567	Having had his start in life as a peanut farmer in remote Kingaroy, the former Premier was fit up until the very end, but palsy was paralyzing his muscles and organs, to which he eventually succumbed.
SNT.8658.19568	"Throughout his life Sir Joh combined enormous energy, vision and an immense capacity for hard work, most especially during his 19-year term as Premier of Queensland," the Governor General said.
SNT.8658.19569	"What looked to us to be huge risks at the time turned out to be nation building," said Bob Katter, a former minister of Joh's Government, who credited Sir Joh with starting the Queensland coal, aluminum and tourism industries.
SNT.8658.19570	He is also remembered for dismantling many of the State's unions, and for a somewhat totalitarian and heavy handed style of keeping control.
SNT.8658.19571	Under Joh, street protests were banned and Special Branch monitored extensively those the authoritarian leader saw as subversives, measures prompting Queenslander, Australian Civil Liberties Council, Terry O'Gorman, to comment Sir Joh was "the most appalling premier Queensland has ever had in terms of civil liberties and human rights".
SNT.8658.19572	Joh was also influential in the famous case of the Dismissal by the Governor General of then-Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, in 1975.
SNT.8658.19573	In his last years as Premier, he had taken his cause to the nation's capital, with the "Joh for PM" campaign.
SNT.8658.19574	But this distraction has been credited with the downfall of his government, with corruption investigations at last being conducted by his stand-in, Bill Gunn.
SNT.8658.19575	The body of Sir Joh, who was of Lutheran faith, is to be buried at Bethany, the family property near Kingaroy.
SNT.77142.19576	Finland now holds the world record for the longest non-stop round of karaoke singing.
SNT.77142.19577	The country already holds the record for the largest number of karaoke singers at any given time.
SNT.77142.19578	The previous record was 145 hours, as held by China.
SNT.77142.19579	However, in a karaoke bar in Kouvola, a small town on Finland's southern coast, the record was surpassed on Wednesday, with the ultimate goal being 240 hours non-stop.
SNT.77142.19580	Finns travelled long distances to participate at the event, which was broadcast live on the internet.
SNT.77142.19581	The record goes alongside Finland's other record for karaoke, that of the largest number singing at any given time.
SNT.77142.19582	This is held by 80,000 fans of the Finnish hard rock band Lordi, who had met in Helsinki for the band to give a brief free concert to celebrate their victory at that year's Eurovision.
SNT.77142.19583	The show culminated with all 80,000 joining in with the band on the winning song, Hard Rock Hallelujah.
SNT.392904.19584	Hawker, Australian Capital Territory — Tonight, the Japanese national team beat the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) softball team 1–0 in the first of a two game series before Japan plays a three game test series against the Australian national team.
SNT.392904.19585	Japan brought five pitchers to Canberra for their Australian tour.
SNT.392904.19586	Since the last Olympics, Japan has been in a rebuilding period.
SNT.392904.19587	The side is young and many of their best players have not had much international experience.
SNT.392904.19588	One of their best pitchers is only nineteen years old.
SNT.392904.19589	The ACT side included Australian national team members Aimee Murch and Clare Warwick; Olympic bronze medalist Brenda De Blaes; Victorian state team representative, national team member and Olympic bronze medalist Justine Smethurst; and Clare Currie, who narrowly missed the cut for the national team.
SNT.392904.19590	De Blaes started the top of the first with a hit.
SNT.392904.19591	Murch was pitching for the ACT to start the bottom of the first.
SNT.392904.19592	Number 15 for Japan opened the inning with a single, and was advanced to third on another single.
SNT.392904.19593	She was tagged out after trying to score a run after her teammate hit a pop up caught by the ACT's centre fielder.
SNT.392904.19594	Number 6 hit a double during this inning, scoring Japan's only run.
SNT.392904.19595	The top of the second saw ACT players 1, 5 and 3 tagged out after hits to the infield.
SNT.392904.19596	The bottom of the second saw number 13 out on a foul ball caught on the fly by the ACT's third baseman, and number 11 and 24 out on balls hit into and caught by the ACT's centre fielder.
SNT.392904.19597	The top of third inning saw numbers 24 and 21 ground out.
SNT.392904.19598	The bottom of the third saw Japan's first batter ground out, number 8 getting a single on an infield hit, another playing getting an out, and the inning ending with number 11 hitting an infield ground out.
SNT.392904.19599	The rest of the game followed much the same pattern.
SNT.392904.19600	Two players, an ACT player and a Japanese, were struck by balls and required trainers to look at them.
SNT.392904.19601	Smethurst came in and pitched a few innings in relief.
SNT.392904.19602	Between the fifth and sixth innings, there was a small delay in the game when a dog named Streaker, owned by Australia men's national softball team player Adam Folkard, ran onto the the infield.
SNT.392904.19603	An announcement was made at the end of the game that the match scheduled for tomorrow would start fifteen minutes earlier than the advertised start time of 18:00.
SNT.58183.19604	The Pentagon has confirmed that US forces began an on-going operation of airstrikes in southern Somalia on Monday, and that the attacks, targeted at Islamic militia, are continuing.
SNT.58183.19605	Somalia's president had earlier said that the United States was pursuing suspects of the 1998 United States embassy bombings.
SNT.58183.19606	It is believed that the militants are sheltering the suspects.
SNT.58183.19607	An attack against Ras Kamboni — a remote island near the Kenyan border, represents the first American involvement in the tumultuous country since the the 1993 operation that resulted in the deaths of as many as 1,500 Somali militiamen and civilians.
SNT.58183.19608	A Somali Defence Ministry official has additionally reported that American helicopters launched an attack against ICU fighters in Afmadow, a city near the Kenyan border, 350 kilometres southwest of Mogadishu.
SNT.58183.19609	The AC-130 gunship attack killed an unknown number of civilians, alternatingly reported as 4, 19 or 31.
SNT.82446.19610	So far, three people (including a baby) have been killed, and at least ten others were injured when two semi trucks collided in a tunnel on Interstate 5 (Newhall Pass) between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California, United States in the late evening of October 12, setting off a chain reaction pileup that involved between 28 and 30 semi trucks and one passenger car.
SNT.82446.19611	The wreck caused a massive fire that burned for over six hours.
SNT.82446.19612	It was previously believed that only 13 semi trucks were involved.
SNT.82446.19613	"The fire burned in a very intense state for approximately four hours and basically consumed everything that was burnable," said John Tripp the Fire Chief for L.A. county.
SNT.82446.19614	As a result of the crash, the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a declaration of a state of emergency for Los Angeles County.
SNT.82446.19615	The debris has been removed and officials say that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because the structure of the tunnel has been compromised.
SNT.82446.19616	"None of the rebar appears to be melted, damaged at this point in time."
SNT.82446.19617	"But it's completely separated from the walls in a number of areas, so we lose vertical support when that happens," said California Department of Transportation official, Doug Failing.
SNT.82446.19618	Tripp added that more bodies could be buried in the wreckage, saying "...we're going to have to do a very methodical search."
SNT.82446.19619	"There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape."
SNT.82446.19620	So far authorities have yet to identify the three people who were killed.
SNT.82446.19621	A full investigation is being conducted into what caused the crash.
SNT.22179.19622	Sparking controversy and eliciting widespread condemnation in an interview with the Washington Post, Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, has made some poorly-judged comments about rape and rape victims.
SNT.22179.19623	Musharaff was quoted as having said, "Rape has become a money-making concern" and he suggested that getting raped was a method of getting a visa to western countries.
SNT.22179.19624	The high-profile rape victim, Mukhtar Mai, dismissed the idea that any woman could allow herself to be subjected to such treatment for money.
SNT.22179.19625	Her case attracted widespread international media attention with it being alleged that her rape was ordered by the local panchayat (town council).
SNT.263969.19626	The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner has questioned Australia's tough asylum seeker policies this week, stating that Australia's mandatory detention regime has "cast a shadow" over its human rights record.
SNT.263969.19627	Navi Pillay, the UN's Human Rights watchdog, was particularly critical of Prime Minister Julia Gillard's asylum seeker trade deal with Malaysia.
SNT.263969.19628	This bilateral agreement, if signed, would see 800 refugees attempting to get to Australia by boat immediately transported to Malaysia instead.
SNT.263969.19629	In return, Australia would take 4,000 genuine refugees from Malaysia over a space of four years.
SNT.263969.19630	However, Malaysia has not signed either the international Refugee Convention, or the Convention Against Torture.
SNT.263969.19631	In an interview with the ABC, Ms Pillay voiced concern over this, stating that Australia may "violate refugee law" by sending asylum seekers to a country where no laws are in place to protect them.
SNT.263969.19632	Pillay, a South African former anti-apartheid protester, also voiced distress over the omnipresence of political "demonising" of these asylum seekers stating, "[t]he consequence of the constant political refrain that Australia is being 'flooded' by people who are 'queue jumpers' has resulted in a stigmatisation of an entire group of people, irrespective of where they have come from or what dangers they have fled".
SNT.263969.19633	In her six-day trip to Australia, the UN Human Rights Commissioner visited two detention centres and said she was overwhelmed with the "grim despondency" of asylum seekers, many of whom wait over 18 months to have their case assessed.
SNT.263969.19634	The mistreatment of refugees was today reinforced with the release of an Australian Rights Commission report, which revealed extensive problems of self-harm and depression among detainees at the Villawood Detention Centre in Sydney.
SNT.42590.19635	The United States Senate has defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.
SNT.42590.19636	The bill was defeated 48 to 49 and did not receive the minimum amount of 60 votes to that would allow the bill to be taken to the full Senate.
SNT.42590.19637	The bill fell 18 votes short of the 67 that were needed for approval.
SNT.42590.19638	In order for the bill to become part of the U.S. Constitution, this bill would have had to be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, then be approved by the legislatures of three fourths (that is, 38) of the States.
SNT.42590.19639	However, Senator David Vitter, R-LA, who is a supporter of the bill says, "we're building votes."
SNT.42590.19640	"Most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples," said John McCain (R-AZ) who opposed the bill.
SNT.42590.19641	"A vote for it is a vote against civil unions, against domestic partnership, against all other efforts for states to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law," said Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy.
SNT.42590.19642	The bill would define marriage as between a man and a woman, and would preclude the official recognizing of same-sex marriages.
SNT.42590.19643	The bill is expected to be taken back to the Senate in July.
SNT.255184.19644	US lawmakers have reached a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown, which would have begun at 12:00 EDT (04:00 UTC) Saturday.
SNT.255184.19645	The agreement, announced just one hour before the shutdown was to occur, includes US$38.5 billion in budget reductions.
SNT.255184.19646	Earlier on Friday, US legislators deflected claims that a midnight deal was being worked out, but Republican Party sources later reported that a deal was likely to be reached.
SNT.255184.19647	The deal was apparently reached after disputes over government funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood were resolved.
SNT.255184.19648	Boehner said both sides decided on a six-day extension, or "bridge," of government funding, which would allow Congress to work out a final solution to last the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year, which ends in September.
SNT.255184.19649	Voting for the resulting agreement will take place some time next week, according to Boehner.
SNT.255184.19650	The last complete US government shutdown occurred in 1995, during the administration of Bill Clinton, lasting five days; it was proceeded by a 21-day partial shutdown.
SNT.255184.19651	In the event of a government shutdown, essential federal employees are still required to work, but nonessential personnel are placed on unpaid furloughs.
SNT.255184.19652	Essential staff include military personnel, air traffic controllers, emergency officials, and intelligence officials.
SNT.190484.19653	In the Philippines, the Liberal Party's presidential candidate Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III, commonly known as Noynoy, was officially elected as the next President of the Philippines in the 2010 presidential election.
SNT.190484.19654	He campaigned for an end to corruption and poverty and says he'll make prosecuting corrupt officials a priority.
SNT.190484.19655	Noynoy received more than 15 million votes, about 5.7 million ahead of his closest opponent, ousted Joseph Estrada.
SNT.190484.19656	Noynoy said in an interview, "I want to lead by example."
SNT.190484.19657	"I did make a public vow, I will never steal".
SNT.190484.19658	Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile told a crowd after the count: "We have done this ... for the Filipino people …"
SNT.190484.19659	He is 50 years old, a bachelor, an economics graduate, a Senator and is the only son of former President Corazon Aquino and former Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr..
SNT.190484.19660	Noynoy's father was shot while in military custody during the regime of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, before his mother, Corazon Aquino, led the People Power Revolution that toppled Marcos in 1986.
SNT.190484.19661	In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately; the Puwersa ng Masang Pilipino Party's vice-presidential candidate Jejomar Cabauatan Binay will become the country's vice-president.
SNT.190484.19662	Noynoy is the President-elect, while Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is the outgoing incumbent.
SNT.190484.19663	He will officially become the Philippines's fifteenth president on June 30.

SNT.79874.19679	Jonathan Thomas scored a try and James Hook added the conversion and a penalty to cut the deficit to twelve points.
SNT.79874.19680	However Chris Latham scored his second try of the match, and Australia's fourth, to restore their hold of the game and secure a bonus point.
SNT.79874.19681	Shane Williams scored a try for Wales in the 76th minute after a strong finish, but it came too late and Australia won by twelve points.

SNT.150840.19690	Two US soldiers killed in Afghanistan yesterday were shot by an Afghan interpreter in Wardek province south-west of Kabul, according to NATO.
SNT.150840.19691	An official said the translator shot them at an eastern Afghanistan outpost before he was shot dead by other soldiers.
SNT.150840.19692	It is not yet clear why the interpreter started shooting; However, the attacker seemed to be a "disgruntled employee", as opposed to a militant, according to a US military official.
SNT.150840.19693	The interpreter had supposedly argued with the soldiers over pay and treatment before opening fire.
SNT.150840.19694	NATO originally only released a terse statement yesterday, stating that two soldiers and one civilian had been killed.
SNT.150840.19695	Elsewhere in Wardek province, four Afghan soldiers died in an airstrike by coalition forces.
SNT.150840.19696	It is not thought that the two incidents are related.
SNT.150840.19697	NATO called the deaths "regrettable" and is to carry out an investigation.
SNT.150840.19698	The Afghan defence ministry is demanding punishment for the "murderers" responsible for the airstrike.
SNT.42176.19699	The Australian federal and New South Wales governments will not be selling their shares in Snowy Hydro Limited (the owner and operator of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme).
SNT.42176.19700	Snowy Hydro Limited's major shareholder is the NSW government with a 58 percent shareholding.
SNT.42176.19701	The Victorian government owns 29 percent and the federal government has a 13 percent stake.
SNT.42176.19702	NSW Premier Morris Iemma announced in December 2005 that he wished to sell the state's share in Snowy Hydro that caused the federal and Victorian governments to follow.
SNT.42176.19703	The proposed sale has attracted immense criticism by those who believed that the sale would affect the environment and water supplies along the Snowy River, this was reinforced yesterday when 58 eminent Australians presented a petition to the government opposing the sale.
SNT.42176.19704	Prime Minister John Howard announced today that the federal government would not be selling its 13 percent share of Snowy Hydro following what he calls "intense community reaction".
SNT.42176.19705	In a statement, Mr Howard said, "This decision to sell the Snowy Hydro has created significant unhappiness, concern and unrest throughout the Australian community."
SNT.42176.19706	Mr Howard said that the sale was not an election promise by his government and that the federal government failed to see any long-term benefits from the sale.
SNT.42176.19707	He also said that the government needed to "safeguard the interests of all those dependent on Australia's iconic water resources".
SNT.42176.19708	The federal government has however stated that despite refusing to sell its share in Snowy Hydro that it will not be purchasing additional shares if NSW and Victoria push ahead with the sale of their shareholdings.
SNT.42176.19709	Despite telling Macquarie Radio earlier this morning that his government would be pushing ahead with the sale as it was in the best "interests of NSW", Premier Iemma announced shortly after Mr Howard's release, that the NSW government would be withdrawing its shares from sale.
SNT.42176.19710	Mr Iemma conceded that the sale would be extremely difficult with the federal government withdrawing its 13 percent from sale.
SNT.42176.19711	"The Prime Minister has pulled the rug out from under the sale," Mr Iemma said.
SNT.42176.19712	"The Commonwealth decision makes it extremely difficult for NSW to proceed," he conceded.
SNT.42176.19713	Victoria is yet to announce whether or not it will be withdrawing its shares from sale.
SNT.48834.19714	Scientists using NASA's Swift Satellite and other telescopes have observed a supernova in near real time occurring in the constellation of Aries.
SNT.48834.19715	The explosion is said to be the most powerful explosion known to scientists, which consists of a gamma-ray burst or an x-ray blast.
SNT.48834.19716	Scientists say that bursts signal the beginning of a star's death.
SNT.48834.19717	Swift first detected the explosion on February 18 (it was given a designation GRB 060218), which allowed telescopes and satellites to watch the event as it happened.
SNT.48834.19718	The blast lasted for more than 2,000 seconds (33 minutes).
SNT.48834.19719	"This is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped Swift could catch," said Neil Gehrels, Swift principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
SNT.48834.19720	"Those observations capture the time when the star collapsed, ejected its outer envelope and most of its mass and left a compact remnant behind."
SNT.48834.19721	"And we think that compact remnant is a neutron star," said an author writing for journal Nature, where the report will be published on Thursday.
SNT.48834.19722	Scientists are also planning on using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory in an attempt to get more images of the event.
SNT.48834.19723	The star is at least 440 million light years from Earth.
SNT.48834.19724	The group of scientists was led by Sergio Campana of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics and Alicia Soderberg, a graduate student at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
SNT.59537.19725	The primary camera on the Hubble Space Telescope has shut down and is likely to only be restored to partial functionality, according to reports from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
SNT.59537.19726	The camera on the telescope, known as the "Advanced Camera for Surveys" or ACS, can be reactivated but will be restored to only one-third of its operating capacity.
SNT.59537.19727	The camera shut down over the weekend, probably due to a failure of its backup power supply.
SNT.59537.19728	It was the third such shutdown of the camera in the past calendar year.
SNT.59537.19729	The camera had been operating on its backup power since June 30, 2006, when engineers switched from the primary power supply ("Side A") to the backup ("Side B") due to a malfunction.
SNT.59537.19730	A review board was convened on January 29 to assess all options and to decide on a course of action.
SNT.59537.19731	Their findings will be reported to NASA on March 2, 2007.
SNT.59537.19732	The ACS, developed jointly by four American agencies, was installed in March of 2002.
SNT.59537.19733	It is a system of three cameras, filters, and dispersers which act to detect wavelengths of light ranging from near-infrared to ultraviolet.
SNT.59537.19734	It is a system that was designed to last five years, according to Preston Burch, associate director and program manager for the Hubble Space Telescope.
SNT.59537.19735	NASA also indicated that the other four main systems on the telescope remain unaffected and functioning normally.
SNT.59537.19736	A scheduled mission to the space telescope in 2008 is expected to deliver instruments to further upgrade the capabilities of the telescope.
SNT.59537.19737	It is not known what the effect of the ACS failure will have on the scheduled mission.
SNT.59537.19738	Burch said in a press release posted on the NASA main website, "It is important that the review board conduct a thorough investigation that will allow us to determine if there are any changes needed in the new instruments that will be installed on the upcoming servicing mission so that we can be sure of maximizing the telescope's scientific output."
SNT.59537.19739	"We are continuing to make excellent progress in our preparations for the servicing mission, which is presently targeted to fly in September 2008."
SNT.255835.19740	One day after France began enforcing a ban on the public wearing Islamic veils that cover the face, either a niqāb or a burqa, French police briefly detained two veiled women.
SNT.255835.19741	The police later claimed that the women were arrested for taking part in an unauthorized protest, not because they were wearing veils.
SNT.255835.19742	The women were arrested while outside the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and may now face fines of up to $217 (150 euros), community service and/or a citizenship course under the law.
SNT.255835.19743	While the ban covers the burqa and the niqāb, it does not include the hijab or the chador.
SNT.255835.19744	The hijab is a veil that leaves the face visible while covering the hair and neck, and the chador covers only the body.
SNT.255835.19745	The law has stirred much debate, both in France and around the globe.
SNT.255835.19746	Those who oppose the new law say it limits freedom of speech and freedom of religion, while supporters claim that women are degraded by wearing veils and the law is intended to empower those women, as well as increase public security.
SNT.255835.19747	The French government, in defense of the ban, said that it was necessary because wearing veils falls short of the living standards in France and and makes women be of an lower status in a country where everybody is considered equal.
SNT.255835.19748	French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has said that the ban is consistent with the national values of France.
SNT.255835.19749	"The French Republic lives in a bare-headed fashion," he said in a statement published by a government newspaper.
SNT.255835.19750	The French government previously made efforts to accommodate Muslims in the country, including establishing a council dealing with the presence of Islam; however, according to Amer Sahar, a professor who studies the topic, some Muslims in the country say that they feel as though they are under assault by the government.
SNT.255835.19751	She said that some are "resentful of the fact that they are not allowed to be both Muslim and French."
SNT.255835.19752	The French government is also concerned with women and children who are forced to veil themselves.
SNT.255835.19753	It has said that such an action is "a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil."
SNT.255835.19754	Activist Rachid Nekkaz auctioned one of his homes to provide money to pay the fine for any woman arrested under the law.
SNT.255835.19755	"I would like to send a clear message to President Nicolas Sarkozy that we can do what we want."
SNT.255835.19756	"We have a constitution and everyone has to respect it," he said.
SNT.255835.19757	According to the French Constitutional Council, the law "conforms to the Constitution" because it does not limit the freedom of religion or excessively punish people for exercising that right in a place of worship.
SNT.13802.19758	A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote.
SNT.13802.19759	648 MEPs out of 680 voted today to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill.
SNT.13802.19760	"This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods."
SNT.13802.19761	"It marks the end of an attempt by the European Commission and governmental patent officials to impose detrimental and legally questionable practices of the European Patent Office (EPO) on the member states," said the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, in opposition to the directive.
SNT.13802.19762	Adversaries to the patent directive claim that a bill covering Intellectual Property (IP) would "stifle innovation" in Europe, as it allows the patenting of implementation within software.
SNT.13802.19763	Many anti-patent activists say that if the bill were passed, small businesses and hobbyists would be in danger of lawsuit from corporations and their extensive patent portfolios.
SNT.123256.19764	United States President Barack Obama is seeking a "comprehensive exit strategy" from the Afghanistan war.
SNT.123256.19765	During a 60 Minutes interview, Obama said, "There's got to be an exit strategy."
SNT.123256.19766	"There's got to be a sense that this is not perpetual drift."
SNT.123256.19767	In February Obama said that 17,000 more troops would be sent this year before the August elections to supplement the 36,000 American troops already deployed in Afghanistan.
SNT.123256.19768	Obama stated that the U.S. Mission in Afghanistan is "making sure that al-Qaeda cannot attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests and our allies."
SNT.123256.19769	Options for a strategy include improving Afghan-Pakistani relations, while rebuilding Afghanistan's economy.
SNT.123256.19770	"I found a very encouraging symmetry of views between our NATO allies and other troop-contributing countries and the United States," Richard Holbrooke, U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan stated.
SNT.123256.19771	"In the past, the United States government stove-piped it, they had an Afghan policy and a Pakistan policy."
SNT.123256.19772	"We have to integrate the two and I hope the rest of the world will join us in that effort," said Holbrooke.
SNT.123256.19773	Obama also said that "the complexities of Afghanistan are matched, maybe even dwarfed, by the complexities of the economic situation."
SNT.123256.19774	"There needs to be a way to withdraw from Afghanistan and place the focus on economic growth."
SNT.123256.19775	"We may need to bring a more regional diplomatic approach to bear."
SNT.123256.19776	"We may need to coordinate more effectively with our allies."
SNT.123256.19777	"But we can't lose sight of what our central mission is."
SNT.123256.19778	European allies have stated they have exit plans for the next three to four years.
SNT.123256.19779	Hamid Karzai, the Afghan President says that although he supports the idea, he urges that there is no need for any "quick fixes".
SNT.15954.19780	Representative Tom Tancredo (R-CO) has clarified his earlier statement that "you could take out their holy sites," in the event of a nuclear attack upon the U.S. by Islamic terrorists.
SNT.15954.19781	Rep. Tancredo has refused to make any apologies, saying "When we bombed Hiroshima, when we bombed Dresden, we punished a lot of people who were not necessarily (guilty)."
SNT.15954.19782	"Not every German was a member of the Nazi Party."
SNT.15954.19783	However, Tancredo emphasized that he was speaking hypothetically and not necessarily suggesting policy.
SNT.15954.19784	The remarks, made in a July 15th radio interview, hosted by Pat Campbell of WFLA in Orlando, Florida, have drawn support from conservatives groups such as Northeast Intelligence Network and Free Republic, and have offended the American Muslim community.
SNT.190280.19785	Veteran White House journalist Helen Thomas, 89, announced her retirement yesterday with immediate effect, ending her fifty-seven year career, amid criticism over controversial remarks.
SNT.190280.19786	Thomas has been a correspondent for over fifty years and has covered every president from John F. Kennedy to Obama.
SNT.190280.19787	Thomas, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, who blazed a trail for female reporters in politics in the United States, has ended her career after apologizing for saying that Israel should "get the hell out of Palestine."
SNT.190280.19788	In retiring, Thomas stated: "I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians."
SNT.190280.19789	"They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance."
SNT.190280.19790	Her departure as Hearst Newspaper columnist was announced after she was captured on video saying: "Remember, these people are occupied and it's their land."
SNT.190280.19791	"It's not Germany, it's not Poland," and that Israelis should "get the hell out of Palestine" and "they should go home" to Poland, Germany, the US and "everywhere else."
SNT.190280.19792	Rabbi David Nesenoff, an independent filmmaker, said he spoke to Thomas outside the White House on Jewish Heritage Day on May 27.
SNT.190280.19793	Video of her controversial comments were widely disseminated on the Internet by his website, rabbilive.com, that relaunched last week.
SNT.190280.19794	She was dropped by her public speaking agency and a high school commencement address was canceled.
SNT.190280.19795	The Hearst statement came shortly after White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called her remarks "offensive and reprehensible."
SNT.190280.19796	Thomas has been a correspondent for fifty-seven years, she had worked for decades as a White House correspondent for United Press International and became a columnist for the Hearst newspaper chain in recent years.
SNT.190280.19797	She was the first female officer of the National Press Club, the first female member and president of the White House Correspondents Association, and, in 1975, the first female member of the Gridiron Club.
SNT.190280.19798	Thomas did little to hide her views, with her questions to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and their press secretaries often about the wars in the Middle East.
SNT.190280.19799	Two weeks ago, she asked Obama, "Mr. President, when are you going to get out of Afghanistan?" 
SNT.190280.19799-1	"Why are you continuing to kill and die there?"
SNT.190280.19799-2	"What is the real excuse?"
SNT.190280.19799-3	" And don't give us this Bushism, 'If we don't go there, they'll all come here.'"
SNT.190280.19800	During Kennedy's administration, Helen ended all presidential press conferences with a signature "Thank you, Mr. President" and always issued a caveat about her work: "In my career you're only as good as your last story."
SNT.105257.19801	Police in Austria have reported that the situation in the cellar where people were illegally imprisoned for over two decades is 'oppressive'.
SNT.105257.19802	They have also said that they cannot stay in the cellar for more than one hour.
SNT.105257.19803	AP reported that this is because there is a low oxygen level in the cellar.
SNT.105257.19804	This announcement by the police comes after police in the Lower Austrian town of Amstetten arrested a 73 year old man who is alleged to have kept his daughter, now aged 42, locked in the cellar of his house in Amstetten since August 29, 1984.
SNT.105257.19805	The man, identified by police as Josef Fritzl, is alleged to have started sexually abusing his daughter, named as Elisabeth Fritzl, when she was eleven years old, and to have subsequently fathered seven children by her.
SNT.105257.19806	One of the children, one of a set of twins born in 1996, died of neglect shortly after birth and the body was burned by the father.
SNT.105257.19807	The surviving six children, three boys and three girls, are currently aged between 5 and 20 years old.
SNT.105257.19808	Three of the children were left on Josef F.'s doorstep and subsequently raised as the adoptive children of Josef F. and his wife, Rosemarie, while the other three children were left with their mother and never saw daylight until she was discovered.
SNT.105257.19809	Rosemarie F. is said to have been unaware of her husbands' activities.
SNT.105257.19810	Police became suspicious when a 19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, was taken to hospital with a mysterious life-threatening illness, and the family's medical records were checked.
SNT.105257.19811	Police say that Elisabeth F. appeared to be "greatly disturbed" psychologically, and only agreed to talk after the authorities assured her that she would not have to have contact with her father, and that her children would be cared for.
SNT.105257.19812	The local authorities have recently released a statement regarding these incidents, an English translation of part of which is available below:
SNT.105257.19813	The news has shocked Austria, as has its similarity to the case of Natascha Kampusch who was kidnapped aged 10, and escaped after being held in a "dungeon" for eight years in 2006.
SNT.53326.19814	The first charges under the new U.K. International Criminal Court Act have been brought against seven British servicemen.
SNT.53326.19815	The charges relate to the mistreatment of civilians and the death of Baha Mousa (26) a hotel receptionist in Basra in 2003.
SNT.53326.19816	The charges include manslaughter, inhumane treatment, causing actual bodily harm, and common assault of Iraqi civilians.
SNT.53326.19817	A Warrant Officer and a Major in the British Intelligence Corps and the former commander of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment (now the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment) are charged with negligently performing duties.
SNT.53326.19818	The first British serviceman to give evidence, a senior aircraftsman in the RAF, testified that he saw prisoners with bags over their heads being kicked and verbally abused.
SNT.53326.19819	He said that he had never seen anything like it before and didn't know what to do.
SNT.53326.19820	He had not intervened "because they (the soldiers) were bigger than me, and I didn't know what their orders were".
SNT.53326.19821	The court martial at the Military Court Centre, Bulford Camp, Wiltshire continues.
SNT.128820.19822	Two British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan on Wednesday, with one being the highest ranking British officer to be killed in 30 years.
SNT.128820.19823	Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe, 40, Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, and Trooper Joshua Hammond, 18, of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, were killed when an improvised explosive device was detonated under their Viking armoured vehicle.
SNT.128820.19824	They had been travelling along the Shamalan Canal, near Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province, on their way to resupply an offensive underway currently against the Taliban.
SNT.128820.19825	General Sir Richard Dannatt, the UK Chief of the General Staff, said Thornloe was "an outstanding commanding officer."
SNT.128820.19826	In a Ministry of Defence (MoD) statement, Dannatt said, "[Thornloe's] courageous, thoughtful stewardship of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards since October last year has seen them superbly prepared for the demands of Afghanistan, both in terms of their professional capability and their unbreakable spirit as a team."
SNT.128820.19827	Trooper Hammond, Danntt said in the MoD statement, "was a first class tank crewman who epitomised the spirited and determined approach to operations expected of Royal Armoured Corps soldiers."
SNT.128820.19828	Lieutenant Colonel Thorneloe is survived by his wife, Sally, and daughters Hannah and Sophie.
SNT.6452.19829	IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center in Cambridge released a free tool March 25 for visualizing the changing history of a document or directory of documents, called history flow.
SNT.6452.19830	The tool offers a variety of views of document histories, including a view that gives each revision equal importance, and a timeline view which displays each revision proportionally to how long it remained current.
SNT.6452.19831	Each different editor who makes changes to the article has a distinct color, allowing for that editor's text to be tracked over time.
SNT.6452.19832	The tool was first developed in 2003 by a collaboration between Fernanda B. Viégas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM.
SNT.6452.19833	It was initially tested out on a large subset of the pages of Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia project which preserves every change made to each of its articles.
SNT.6452.19834	The resulting paper was drafted in the winter of 2003 and presented at a conference in April 2004; it remains the most comprehensive overview of the lifecycle of articles in an active wiki community.
SNT.6452.19835	A year later, the history flow paper is still the most frequently cited source of statistics about the reversion of vandalism on Wikipedia.
SNT.6452.19836	The current tool is maintained by Martin Wattenberg and Jonathan Feinberg at IBM.
SNT.6452.19837	It allows users to download the text and histories of the contents of any MoinMoin wiki, or to view the history of the contents of an entire directory of documents.
SNT.6452.19838	The tool is free to download and use, but its code is not open source.
SNT.6452.19839	The support for MoinMoin wikis comes via a plugin, so the tool may be extensible to the native interfaces of other wiki engines in the future.

SNT.323922.19854	Republican candidates for President of the United States Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have failed to qualify to be on the ballot for the Virginia primary election, scheduled for March 6, Super Tuesday.
SNT.323922.19855	Gingrich, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Perry, Governor of Texas, did not submit the 10,000 signatures, with at least 400 from each of the state's eleven congressional districts, to the state's board of elections before the 5:00 PM deadline last Thursday required to gain ballot access, according to the Republican Party of Virginia.
SNT.323922.19856	Gingrich's and Perry's campaigns both claimed to have more signatures than needed, 11,050 and 11,911 respectively.
SNT.323922.19857	Volunteers spent last night reviewing the submitted petitions and validating signatures.
SNT.323922.19858	Reportedly Rick Perry is considering an appeal of the assessment.

SNT.323922.19861	According to the manager of the Gingrich campaign, Michael Krull, the former House Speaker plans to compete in the Virginia primary, despite not gaining ballot access, as a write-in candidate.
SNT.323922.19862	Krull blamed a "failed system" for the campaign's inability to gain ballot access.
SNT.323922.19863	Rick Perry's campaign manager said he was disappointed by that campaign's failure to qualify for the ballot.
SNT.323922.19864	According to a recent poll of 489 Republican voters by Quinnipiac University, Gingrich leads in the state with 30% of support, followed by Mitt Romney at 25% and Ron Paul at 9%.
SNT.323922.19865	As Virginia's delegates to the Republican National Convention are not awarded on a winner-take-all basis, candidates other than the winner of the state's primary could also gain delegates from the state.
SNT.9797.19866	North Korea's official news agency is reporting that the country has finished removing all its spent nuclear fuel rods, over 8,000 of them, from the main reactor in the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
SNT.9797.19867	The rods could be reprocessed for several months to extract weapons-grade plutonium.
SNT.9797.19868	Officials say the rods could be able to provide enough plutonium to make two nuclear bombs.
SNT.9797.19869	This could possibly signal that North Korea is preparing for a nuclear arms test.
SNT.9797.19870	North Korea may already have enough materials to make six nuclear bombs.
SNT.9797.19871	North Korea has also announced plans to continue operating the Yongbyon facility, as well as to begin construction on a larger reactor.

SNT.8081.19874	The extra flights will mean that British Airways will now fly from Bucharest to London, and back, ten times a week.
SNT.51992.19875	Renault driver Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 2006 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix on the Suzuka International Racing Course.
SNT.51992.19876	Though Ferrari drivers Felipe Massa and Michael Schumacher started the race from the first row, Alonso managed to overtake both Toyotas on the first part of the race and Massa after the pit stops.
SNT.51992.19877	Then Alonso started to push on Michael Schumacher and closed the gap to about 5 seconds.
SNT.51992.19878	An engine failure forced Schumacher to park his car after the tunnel on lap 36 and the Spaniard rushed to his seventh victory in this season.
SNT.51992.19879	Giancarlo Fisichella, Fernando's teammate, had a bad start, but burst through Toyota and finished on the back of the second-placed Filipe Massa.
SNT.51992.19880	Toyota drivers Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher lost even more positions, when Honda driver Jenson Button and McLaren Mercedes driver Kimi Räikkönen slipped in front of them and finished on 4-th and 5-th place respectively.
SNT.51992.19881	The situation in the drivers' championship became almost critical for Schumacher, who lost 10 points this week-end.
SNT.51992.19882	Only one chance remains for Schumacher to win his eighth champion's title - if he wins the final 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix and Alonso doesn't score any points.
SNT.51992.19883	"I have to say clearly I don't really believe in the championship anymore," was Schumacher's reaction.
SNT.51992.19884	There remains a battle for the third place in drivers' championship, where Massa has a one point lead ahead of Fisichella.
SNT.51992.19885	In the constructor's championship Renault is 9 points ahead of Ferrari.

SNT.190499.19892	For nearly an hour, police chased the elephant around the city before she was finally peacefully recaptured in the Talstrasse section of Zurich.
SNT.190499.19893	Circus officials and police followed Sabu, but a circus spokesperson said that she did not respond to their calls.
SNT.190499.19894	Sabu was also said to have been moving so fast that police had difficulty keeping up with her.
SNT.190499.19895	At about 2000 local time (1900 UTC), a keeper was able to control the animal and load her onto a truck to take her to Winterthur, where the other circus animals were.
SNT.190499.19896	There were no reports of any damage or injuries during the incident, and although police held back onlookers, at least one bystander managed to capture video of the event.
