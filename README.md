## Paper Summary for Assignment 2
The paper proposes a new type of transition-based dependency parser based on neural networks. The new parser is intended to address the major problems suffered by conventional transition-based dependency parsers such as poor generalization due to the use of highly sparse features, incompleteness of manually designed feature templates, and computationally expensive feature generation. To solve those issues, the paper builds a neural network-based parser with only a small number of dense features. As a result, the new parser works very fast compared to the conventional models while achieving about 2% improvement in model accuracy compared to the latter.
